# datasets
Collection of datasets for AI research, specially focused on natural language processing and conversational systems.

__This is a work under progress__

In the NLP field plenty of datasets in English language do exist. Research on other languages, such as Spanish, is severly limited to the lack of good quality datasets. This repository is aimed to compensate this difficulties by building some datasets, at a first stage through the translation of the most notorious English natural language datasets.
Translation is temptativly made in an automatic fashion and therefore the resulting datasets must be use with caution.

All datasets included in this repository are open source and can be used freely for any research or application purpose.

Currently the following datasets are included:
- [Cornell Movies Dialogues](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html):
  - Translation to Spanish
- [Person-Chat dataset](http://convai.io/#personachat-convai2-dataset) (See also http://convai.io/data/):
  - Translation to Spanish
