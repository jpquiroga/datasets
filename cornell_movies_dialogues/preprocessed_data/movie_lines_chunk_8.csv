290490,L628004,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
290491,L628003,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis."
290492,L628002,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Five.
290493,L628001,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?"
290494,L627996,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time."
290495,L627995,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"God, Spiderman looks different."
290496,L627993,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"That's a ""Rookies"" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in ""The Black Hole""? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine."
290497,L627992,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,What's that?
290498,L627991,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" Lunch boxes. ""Green Hornet"" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here."
290499,L627990,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
290500,L627989,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Four hundred bucks.
290501,L627988,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,You bet. How much is that worth?
290502,L627987,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what ""Spiderman"" number one looks like?"
290503,L627986,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Do you get paid a lot?
290504,L627985,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day."
290505,L627984,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,That's a long time.
290506,L627983,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Almost four years.
290507,L627982,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,How long have you worked here?
290508,L627981,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music."
290509,L627980,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Wow. What a swell place to work.
290510,L627978,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you."
290511,L627977,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?"
290512,L627976,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out."
290513,L627975,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
290514,L627974,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
290515,L627973,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Do you have a fella?
290516,L627972,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians."
290517,L627971,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Turn-offs?
290518,L627970,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie."
290519,L627969,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What are your turn-ons?
290520,L627968,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like ""He's a Rebel""."
290521,L627967,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What kinda music do you like?
290522,L627966,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Very much. Now, where were we?"
290523,L627965,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Like it?
290524,L627964,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Yes, I would."
290525,L627963,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Would you like a bite of my pie?
290526,L627962,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Burt Reynolds.
290527,L627961,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What's your favorite movie star?
290528,L627960,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black."
290529,L627959,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What's your favorite color?
290530,L627958,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
290531,L627957,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Where are you from.
290532,L627956,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I don't remember.
290533,L627955,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What do you do?
290534,L627954,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Ask me them again. One by one.
290535,L627953,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?"
290536,L627952,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,What do you want to know?
290537,L627951,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
290538,L627950,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,There's nothing to tell.
290539,L627949,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Tell me about yourself.
290540,L627948,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,How 'bout me what?
290541,L627947,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, enough about the King. How about you?"
290542,L627946,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I'd love some pie.
290543,L627945,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Would you like to get some pie?
290544,L627944,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I love to get pie after a movie.
290545,L627943,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?"
290546,L627942,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,No. Not particularly.  How come?
290547,L627941,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?"
290548,L627940,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,'Bout twelve.
290549,L627939,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,What time is it?
290550,L627938,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
290551,L627937,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Sure. Why not?
290552,L627936,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
290553,L627935,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I took a cab.
290554,L627934,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
290555,L627932,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"That's my real name, really. I got proof. See."
290556,L627931,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Is that your real name? Really?
290557,L627930,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
290558,L627929,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"My name is Clarence, and what is yours?"
290559,L627928,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"If that was the R, I'd love to see the X."
290560,L627927,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the ""Streetfighter"". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R."
290561,L627926,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Sonny kicks ass.
290562,L627925,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
290563,L627924,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Great movie. Action-packed!
290564,L627923,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up."
290565,L627922,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I thought Sonny was the good guy.
290566,L627921,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Thanks a lot.
290567,L627920,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Want some Goobers?
290568,L627919,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him."
290569,L627918,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,The oriental.
290570,L627917,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba."
290571,L627915,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
290572,L627914,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
290573,L627913,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
290574,L627912,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
290575,L627911,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?"
290576,L627885,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,And here we are.
290577,L627884,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, ""Get her in here."". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go."
290578,L627847,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Now hang up.
290579,L627846,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Bye-bye.
290580,L627843,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over."
290581,L627842,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over."
290582,L627839,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Get it.
290583,L627838,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Tell him to look through it.
290584,L627835,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Ya looked through it?
290585,L627834,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Has he looked through it yet?
290586,L627828,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,The letter he sent.
290587,L627827,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,The letter I sent.
290588,L627821,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Don't eat anything.
290589,L627820,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
290590,L627815,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
290591,L627814,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Tell him we gotta go.
290592,L627792,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Oh, hush up."
290593,L627791,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
290594,L627790,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon."
290595,L627760,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
290596,L627759,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,How come?
290597,L627758,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I didn't get any chicken.
290598,L627757,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
290599,L627756,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,The forager's back.
290600,L627719,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,"Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy."
290601,L627718,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie."
290602,L627713,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?"
290603,L627712,u8631,m586,ALABAMA,I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
290604,L627697,u8639,m586,DREXL,"In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun."
290605,L627696,u8632,m586,BIG D,I'm hip.
290606,L627689,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do."
290607,L627688,u8632,m586,BIG D,"Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -"
290608,L627684,u8632,m586,BIG D,Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
290609,L627683,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Damn skippy. He like it, too."
290610,L627674,u8639,m586,DREXL,Heard that.
290611,L627673,u8632,m586,BIG D,"Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks."
290612,L627668,u8639,m586,DREXL,I heard that.
290613,L627667,u8632,m586,BIG D,"Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off."
290614,L627666,u8639,m586,DREXL,Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
290615,L627665,u8632,m586,BIG D,What the fuck are you talkin' about?
290616,L627692,u8632,m586,BIG D,Take that shit somewhere else.

290618,L627682,u8632,m586,BIG D,"You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it."
290619,L627681,u8642,m586,FLOYD,Naw naw!
290620,L627680,u8632,m586,BIG D,So you do eat pussy!
290621,L627679,u8642,m586,FLOYD,Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
290622,L627670,u8632,m586,BIG D,"Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang."
290623,L627669,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?"
290624,L628603,u8641,m586,ELVIS,"That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that."
290625,L628602,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved ""Coming Home in a Body Bag""."
290626,L628601,u8641,m586,ELVIS,"You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass."
290627,L628600,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?"
290628,L628599,u8641,m586,ELVIS,Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
290629,L628598,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
290630,L628581,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that."
290631,L628580,u8641,m586,ELVIS,"Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: ""I'll take that gun"", ""You'll have to""."
290632,L628579,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
290633,L628578,u8641,m586,ELVIS,All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
290634,L628577,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
290635,L628576,u8641,m586,ELVIS,"Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool."
290636,L628093,u8641,m586,ELVIS,"Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it."
290637,L628092,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,If I thought I could get away with it -
290638,L628091,u8641,m586,ELVIS,I don't blame you.
290639,L628090,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life."
290640,L628089,u8641,m586,ELVIS,He don't got no right to live.
290641,L628088,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,You'd really do that?
290642,L628087,u8641,m586,ELVIS,I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
290643,L628086,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
290644,L628085,u8641,m586,ELVIS,Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
290645,L628084,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Yeah.
290646,L628083,u8641,m586,ELVIS,You wanna get unhaunted?
290647,L628082,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Yeah.
290648,L628081,u8641,m586,ELVIS,With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
290649,L628080,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Live with what?
290650,L628079,u8641,m586,ELVIS,Can you live with it?
290651,L628078,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What?
290652,L628136,u8639,m586,DREXL,Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
290653,L628135,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Wannabee nigger...
290654,L628125,u8639,m586,DREXL,"No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, ""This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV."" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties."
290655,L628124,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,No thanks.
290656,L628123,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know."
290657,L628115,u8639,m586,DREXL,Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
290658,L628114,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I'm her husband.
290659,L628113,u8639,m586,DREXL,Who the fuck are you?
290660,L628112,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,She's with me.
290661,L628111,u8639,m586,DREXL,Where the fuck is that bitch?
290662,L628551,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick."
290663,L628550,u8637,m586,DICK,No. But thanks.
290664,L628456,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Yeah, let's just get outta here."
290665,L628455,u8637,m586,DICK,"Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here."
290666,L628452,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"This is our last chance to play ""what if"". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught."
290667,L628451,u8637,m586,DICK,"Now's a helluva time to play ""what if""."
290668,L628448,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?"
290669,L628447,u8637,m586,DICK,Do you really mean it?
290670,L628445,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it."
290671,L628444,u8637,m586,DICK,"Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -"
290672,L628443,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?"
290673,L628442,u8637,m586,DICK,In case of what?
290674,L628441,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,In case.
290675,L628440,u8637,m586,DICK,What the fuck did you bring that for.
290676,L628417,u8637,m586,DICK,"Um, nothing, let's go?"
290677,L628416,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Yeah?
290678,L628415,u8637,m586,DICK,Clarence.
290679,L628414,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late."
290680,L628413,u8637,m586,DICK,They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
290681,L628412,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"No shit? Dick, that's great!"
290682,L628411,u8637,m586,DICK,"I got the part on ""T.J. Hooker""."
290683,L628406,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
290684,L628405,u8637,m586,DICK,"Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby."
290685,L628234,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Let me handle this.
290686,L628233,u8637,m586,DICK,Clarence...
290687,L628206,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'."
290688,L628205,u8637,m586,DICK,"Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit."
290689,L628204,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Two guys.
290690,L628203,u8637,m586,DICK,Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
290691,L628202,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What's to think about?
290692,L628201,u8637,m586,DICK,Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
290693,L628200,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
290694,L628199,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,The zoo.
290695,L628198,u8637,m586,DICK,Where?
290696,L628197,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff."
290697,L628196,u8637,m586,DICK,Elliot Blitzer.
290698,L628195,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Elliot what?
290699,L628194,u8637,m586,DICK,Elliot.
290700,L628193,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What's this acting class guy's name?
290701,L628192,u8637,m586,DICK,"Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't."
290702,L628191,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What'd'ya tell 'em?
290703,L628190,u8637,m586,DICK,He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
290704,L628189,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Is he big league?
290705,L628188,u8637,m586,DICK,"It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you."
290706,L628187,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
290707,L628186,u8637,m586,DICK,Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
290708,L628185,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
290709,L628184,u8637,m586,DICK,"Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -"
290710,L628183,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
290711,L628182,u8637,m586,DICK,"Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine."
290712,L628181,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?"
290713,L628180,u8637,m586,DICK,This is Drexl's coke?
290714,L628179,u8637,m586,DICK,I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
290715,L628178,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Tell me.
290716,L628177,u8637,m586,DICK,Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
290717,L628176,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I know.
290718,L628175,u8637,m586,DICK,"You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!"
290719,L628174,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I certainly hope so.
290720,L628173,u8637,m586,DICK,It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
290721,L628170,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,It'll get ya high.
290722,L628169,u8637,m586,DICK,This shit can't be real.
290723,L627903,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
290724,L627902,u8637,m586,DICK,"You're really in love, aren't you?"
290725,L627901,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Every word of it.
290726,L627900,u8637,m586,DICK,How much of that letter was on the up and up?
290727,L627897,u8637,m586,DICK,"You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope."
290728,L627896,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Did you meet Captain Kirk?
290729,L627895,u8637,m586,DICK,... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
290730,L627892,u8637,m586,DICK,"What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for ""T.J. Hooker"" the other day."
290731,L627891,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Good for you.
290732,L627890,u8637,m586,DICK,"Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class."
290733,L627889,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,You goin' out?
290734,L627888,u8637,m586,DICK,"Just like in Detroit, only skinnier."
290735,L627887,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?"
290736,L627886,u8637,m586,DICK,That's a pretty amazing story.
290737,L627845,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Now tell him goodbye.
290738,L627844,u8637,m586,DICK,Money problems?
290739,L627830,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Has he gotten his mail today?
290740,L627829,u8637,m586,DICK,Clarence sent a letter?
290741,L627823,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Ask him if he got the letter.
290742,L627822,u8637,m586,DICK,"Alabama, could you tell Clar -"
290743,L627817,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
290744,L627816,u8637,m586,DICK,What?
290745,L627810,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?"
290746,L627809,u8637,m586,DICK,Get the fuck outta here!
290747,L627808,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I'm a married man.
290748,L627807,u8637,m586,DICK,Get the fuck outta here!
290749,L627806,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me."
290750,L627805,u8637,m586,DICK,What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
290751,L627804,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Tomorrow.
290752,L627803,u8637,m586,DICK,You comin' to L.A.? When?
290753,L627802,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly."
290754,L627801,u8637,m586,DICK,It's great to hear from you.

290758,L627657,u8647,m586,LUCY,You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
290759,L627656,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever."
290760,L627655,u8647,m586,LUCY,Who's Sonny Chiba?
290761,L627654,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"A Donny Chiba triple feature. ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the Streetfighter"", and ""Sister Streetfighter""."
290762,L627653,u8647,m586,LUCY,What are we gonna see?
290763,L627652,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
290764,L627651,u8647,m586,LUCY,How 'bout me what?
290765,L627650,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?"
290766,L627649,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?"
290767,L627648,u8647,m586,LUCY,When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
290768,L627647,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Really?
290769,L627646,u8647,m586,LUCY,I'd fuck Elvis.

290776,L628481,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,No.
290777,L628480,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Don't you?

290789,L628236,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts."
290790,L628235,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,"Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe."
290791,L628232,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
290792,L628231,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,"No. No, you don't."
290793,L628230,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
290794,L628229,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,What?
290795,L628227,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,Sure. I didn't hear anything.
290796,L628226,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'."
290797,L628225,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,He trusts you?
290798,L628224,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust."
290799,L628223,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,The police department?

290801,L628221,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,What department?
290802,L628220,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department."
290803,L628219,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,"Look, Dick, I don't -"
290804,L628218,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -"
290805,L628217,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,"Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?"
290806,L628216,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
290807,L628213,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
290808,L628212,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
290809,L628211,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Leave the gorillas.
290810,L628210,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,"Yeah, OK."
290811,L628209,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Want an animal cracker?
290812,L628208,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
290813,L628303,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick."
290814,L628302,u8636,m586,CUSTOMER,I can see what you mean.
290815,L628301,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps."
290816,L628300,u8636,m586,CUSTOMER,"That good, huh?"
290817,L628299,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong."
290818,L628298,u8636,m586,CUSTOMER,No. Not yet.
290819,L628297,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Have you read the story on Elvis?
290820,L628296,u8636,m586,CUSTOMER,"Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one."
290821,L628574,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room."
290822,L628573,u8645,m586,LEE,Wanna count your money?
290823,L628564,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I bullshitted him.
290824,L628563,u8645,m586,LEE,"If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?"
290825,L628562,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,We grew up together.
290826,L628561,u8645,m586,LEE,Why does he trust you?
290827,L628560,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it."
290828,L628559,u8645,m586,LEE,Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
290829,L628554,u8645,m586,LEE,Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
290830,L628553,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,A Norms in Van Nuys.
290831,L628552,u8645,m586,LEE,Where'd you go?
290832,L628547,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
290833,L628546,u8645,m586,LEE,You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
290834,L628545,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Me too, Boris."
290835,L628544,u8645,m586,LEE,"Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee."
290836,L628543,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more."
290837,L628531,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
290838,L628530,u8645,m586,LEE,I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
290839,L628529,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. ""Sophie's Choice"", ""Ordinary People"", ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Gandhi"". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit."
290840,L628528,u8645,m586,LEE,"Thank you very much, Clarence."
290841,L628527,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"" is one of my favorite movies. After ""Apocalypse Now"" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever."
290842,L628526,u8645,m586,LEE,"Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee."
290843,L628525,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Oh, Mr. Donowitz -"
290844,L628524,u8645,m586,LEE,"I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody."
290845,L628523,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these ""Soldier of Fortune"" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table."
290846,L628262,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire."
290847,L628261,u8645,m586,LEE,"Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to ""Doctor Zhivago"" are in arbitration?"
290848,L628260,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is ""Doctor Zhivago"". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine."
290849,L628259,u8645,m586,LEE,"But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk."
290850,L628257,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot."
290851,L628256,u8645,m586,LEE,"I don't know, Clarence, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a pretty big movie."
290852,L627787,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son."
290853,L627786,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"We do make a cute couple, don't we?"
290854,L627785,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple."
290855,L627784,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Keep it.
290856,L627783,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I got some money I can give you -
290857,L627782,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me."
290858,L627781,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it."
290859,L627780,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
290860,L627779,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake."
290861,L627778,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Who is he?
290862,L627777,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should."
290863,L627776,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Nope.
290864,L627775,u8634,m586,CLIFF,Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
290865,L627774,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,No shit?
290866,L627773,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that."
290867,L627772,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Do tell. Why drug related?
290868,L627771,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related."
290869,L627755,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always ""OK"", ""No problem"", ""You're a busy guy, I understand"". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems."
290870,L627754,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"You got it all worked out, don't you?"
290871,L627753,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,I'm your son.
290872,L627752,u8634,m586,CLIFF,What makes you think I would do that?
290873,L627751,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,You were a cop.
290874,L627750,u8634,m586,CLIFF,What makes you think I could do that?
290875,L627749,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?"
290876,L627748,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Yes, I still have friends on the force."
290877,L627747,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Do you still have friends on the force?
290878,L627746,u8634,m586,CLIFF,Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
290879,L627745,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,What?
290880,L627744,u8634,m586,CLIFF,What do you want from me?
290881,L627743,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!"
290882,L627742,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free."
290883,L627724,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help."
290884,L627723,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?"
290885,L627722,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -"
290886,L627721,u8634,m586,CLIFF,She seems very nice.
290887,L627720,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?"
290888,L627717,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
290889,L627716,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I really don't know.
290890,L627715,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?"
290891,L627714,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I'm really not very -
290892,L627711,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?"
290893,L627710,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th."
290894,L627709,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
290895,L627705,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,That's about all I ever eat.
290896,L627704,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"I can, but I don't."
290897,L627703,u8633,m586,CLARENCE,"Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?"
290898,L627702,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
290899,L627878,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?"
290900,L627877,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,Come again?
290901,L627876,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers."
290902,L627875,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,Uh-huh.
290903,L627874,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?"
290904,L627872,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,Sure.
290905,L627871,u8634,m586,CLIFF,Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
290906,L627868,u8634,m586,CLIFF,They didn't tell me.
290907,L627867,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
290908,L627866,u8634,m586,CLIFF,On their honeymoon.
290909,L627865,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
290910,L627864,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I don't believe you.
290911,L627863,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,"I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks."
290912,L627862,u8634,m586,CLIFF,What are you talkin' about?
290913,L627861,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,"Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead."
290914,L627860,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I've seen him.
290915,L627858,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -"
290916,L627857,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
290917,L627856,u8634,m586,CLIFF,No.
290918,L627855,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,"I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?"
290919,L627854,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
290920,L627853,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,"I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?"
290921,L627852,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I give up. Who are you?
290922,L627851,u8635,m586,COCCOTTI,"Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?"
290923,L627770,u8653,m586,WILSON,"Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla."
290924,L627769,u8634,m586,CLIFF,You and Robin moved?
290925,L627768,u8653,m586,WILSON,I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
290926,L627767,u8634,m586,CLIFF,I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
290927,L627766,u8653,m586,WILSON,McTeague.
290928,L627765,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?"
290929,L627764,u8653,m586,WILSON,Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
290930,L627763,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale."
290931,L627762,u8653,m586,WILSON,What about him?
290932,L627761,u8634,m586,CLIFF,"It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey."
290933,L627740,u8637,m586,DICK,"Well, don't just sit there, shoot him."
290934,L627739,u8651,m586,RAVENCROFT,I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
290935,L627738,u8637,m586,DICK,Where'd he come from?
290936,L627737,u8637,m586,DICK,Absolutely.
290937,L627736,u8651,m586,RAVENCROFT,Could we try it now?
290938,L627735,u8637,m586,DICK,Sure. No problem.
290939,L627734,u8651,m586,RAVENCROFT,"If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?"
290940,L627733,u8637,m586,DICK,Thank you.
290941,L627732,u8651,m586,RAVENCROFT,That was very good.
290942,L627731,u8637,m586,DICK,"Well, don't just sit there, shoot him."
290943,L627730,u8651,m586,RAVENCROFT,I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
290944,L627729,u8637,m586,DICK,Where'd you come from?
290945,L627728,u8651,m586,RAVENCROFT,"Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready."
290946,L627727,u8651,m586,RAVENCROFT,Step inside.
290947,L627726,u8637,m586,DICK,"I'm me... I mean, that's me."
290948,L628379,u8638,m586,DIMES,"Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust."
290949,L628378,u8644,m586,KRINKLE,Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
290950,L628377,u8638,m586,DIMES,We talked him into it.
290951,L628376,u8644,m586,KRINKLE,He'll wear a wire?
290952,L628373,u8638,m586,DIMES,I believe he believes him.
290953,L628372,u8644,m586,KRINKLE,Do you believe him?
290954,L628371,u8638,m586,DIMES,Sure was.
290955,L628370,u8644,m586,KRINKLE,That was a good fuckin' movie.
290956,L628369,u8638,m586,DIMES,Uh-huh.
290957,L628368,u8644,m586,KRINKLE,That Vietnam movie?
290958,L628353,u8638,m586,DIMES,"Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him."
290959,L628352,u8644,m586,KRINKLE,"Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?"
290960,L628496,u8638,m586,DIMES,"You're an actor, so act, motherfucker."
290961,L628495,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself."
290962,L628491,u8638,m586,DIMES,This guy's gonna kill him.
290963,L628490,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on."
290964,L628484,u8638,m586,DIMES,Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
290965,L628483,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,We gotta get him outta there.
290966,L628478,u8638,m586,DIMES,He knows something's up.
290967,L628477,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,How's he supposed to see the wire?
290968,L628476,u8638,m586,DIMES,He saw the wire.
290969,L628475,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,How the fuck could he know?
290970,L628474,u8638,m586,DIMES,He knows.
290971,L628435,u8638,m586,DIMES,"Hope you're a good actor, Elliot."
290972,L628434,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,You do.
290973,L628433,u8638,m586,DIMES,You do more than try.
290974,L628428,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
290975,L628427,u8638,m586,DIMES,"We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine."
290976,L628426,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail."
290977,L628375,u8638,m586,DIMES,"This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire."
290978,L628374,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him."
290979,L628367,u8638,m586,DIMES,"He produced ""Coming Home in a Body Bag""."
290980,L628366,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz."
290981,L628365,u8638,m586,DIMES,Suspect's words -
290982,L628357,u8638,m586,DIMES,"So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it."
290983,L628356,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid."
290984,L628355,u8638,m586,DIMES,"Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him."
290985,L628354,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,Nicholson and I.
290986,L628351,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -"
290987,L628350,u8638,m586,DIMES,"Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -"
290988,L628348,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions."
290989,L628347,u8638,m586,DIMES,'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
290990,L628346,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman."
290991,L628345,u8638,m586,DIMES,"But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -"
290992,L628344,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
290993,L628343,u8638,m586,DIMES,Or a supporting actor -
290994,L628342,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,Or a bit player -
290995,L628341,u8638,m586,DIMES,You're no longer an extra -
290996,L628340,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -"
290997,L628339,u8638,m586,DIMES,No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
290998,L628338,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,But a fuckin' baggie.
290999,L628337,u8638,m586,DIMES,Not a tiny little vial -
291000,L628336,u8650,m586,NICHOLSON,"Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -"
291001,L628141,u8639,m586,DREXL,Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
291002,L628140,u8648,m586,MARTY,I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
291003,L628139,u8639,m586,DREXL,"I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?"
291004,L628134,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day."
291005,L628133,u8648,m586,MARTY,"Naw, man, it ain't white boy day."
291006,L628132,u8639,m586,DREXL,"You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?"
291007,L628131,u8648,m586,MARTY,Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
291008,L628130,u8639,m586,DREXL,"You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?"
291009,L628122,u8648,m586,MARTY,Pussy love pink rocks.
291010,L628121,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up."
291011,L628118,u8639,m586,DREXL,"You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips."
291012,L628117,u8648,m586,MARTY,Rock whores.
291013,L628116,u8639,m586,DREXL,What was I sayin'?
291014,L627695,u8639,m586,DREXL,"With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please."
291015,L627694,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy."
291016,L627693,u8639,m586,DREXL,You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
291017,L627687,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"I tell Jayne Kennedy, ""Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"""
291018,L627686,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say ""Bitch, suck my dick!"" and then Jayne Kennedy says, ""First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!"" Now, what do you say?"
291019,L627685,u8642,m586,FLOYD,Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
291020,L627677,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere."
291021,L627676,u8639,m586,DREXL,- Because it's good!
291022,L627675,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -"
291023,L627672,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker."
291024,L627671,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Preach on, Big D."
291025,L627664,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Nigger, you lie like a big dog."
291026,L627663,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Naw man, that's some serious shit."
291027,L627662,u8639,m586,DREXL,That's bullshit.
291028,L627661,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit."
291029,L627660,u8639,m586,DREXL,"Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit."
291030,L628334,u8643,m586,KANDI,Read my lips.
291031,L628333,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
291032,L628332,u8643,m586,KANDI,No.
291033,L628331,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,Put it in your pants.
291034,L628330,u8643,m586,KANDI,I'm not wearing a bra.
291035,L628329,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,"Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra."
291036,L628328,u8643,m586,KANDI,"No way, Jos."
291037,L628327,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
291038,L628326,u8643,m586,KANDI,I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
291039,L628325,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,Just put it in your purse.
291040,L628324,u8643,m586,KANDI,You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
291041,L628323,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,You gotta hold this for me.
291042,L628322,u8643,m586,KANDI,What can I do?
291043,L628321,u8640,m586,ELLIOT,"Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me."
291044,L628254,u8652,m586,VIRGIL,You're right. It is.
291045,L628253,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember."
291046,L628252,u8652,m586,VIRGIL,How do you know? You been there?
291047,L628251,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn."
291048,L628250,u8652,m586,VIRGIL,"Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?"
291049,L628249,u8642,m586,FLOYD,Exactly room-mates.
291050,L628248,u8652,m586,VIRGIL,Sorta room-mates?
291051,L628247,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Yeah, I live here."
291052,L628246,u8652,m586,VIRGIL,Do you live here?
291053,L628245,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Naw, he ain't home right now."
291054,L628244,u8652,m586,VIRGIL,"Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?"
291055,L628509,u8642,m586,FLOYD,"Well, you go down Beechwood..."
291056,L628508,u8646,m586,LENNY,Where's that?
291057,L628507,u8642,m586,FLOYD,He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
291058,L628506,u8646,m586,LENNY,Do you know where we can find him?
291059,L628505,u8642,m586,FLOYD,Yes.
291060,L628504,u8646,m586,LENNY,Do you know a Clarence Worley?
291061,L628503,u8642,m586,FLOYD,No.
291062,L628502,u8646,m586,LENNY,Are you Dick Ritchie?
291063,L628501,u8642,m586,FLOYD,Yes.
291064,L628540,u8649,m586,MARVIN,"Donowitz, he said."
291065,L628539,u8646,m586,LENNY,What was the Jew-boy's name?
291066,L628386,u8646,m586,LENNY,Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
291067,L628385,u8649,m586,MARVIN,I didn't mean -
291068,L628384,u8646,m586,LENNY,Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
291069,L628383,u8649,m586,MARVIN,No.
291070,L628382,u8646,m586,LENNY,"Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?"
291071,L630037,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,"We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you."
291072,L630036,u8657,m587,COLE,I understand.  There'd be no point.
291073,L630029,u8657,m587,COLE,"Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it...""dimensions."" It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not."
291074,L630028,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,"You said we weren't ""real,"" Cole..."
291075,L630025,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are..."
291076,L630024,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,"The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become ""addicted"" have you, Cole?  To that ""dying"" world'"
291077,L630006,u8657,m587,COLE,"I DON'T WANT YOUR ""WOMEN,"" YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!"
291078,L630005,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,Women will want to get to know you...
291079,L629711,u8657,m587,COLE,"Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital."
291080,L629710,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,Him?  You saw that man?
291081,L629694,u8657,m587,COLE,"Uh, what?"
291082,L629693,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,Well?
291083,L629498,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,"We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people."
291084,L629497,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, sir!"
291085,L629489,u8657,m587,COLE,"Uh, I didn't hear the..."
291086,L629488,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,"Wake up, Cole."
291087,L629479,u8657,m587,COLE,I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
291088,L629478,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,We want you to tell us about last night.
291089,L630002,u8660,m587,ENGINEER,"This is it, James...what you've been working for."
291090,L630001,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,We're very close!  Because of you!
291091,L629993,u8660,m587,ENGINEER,You're still a little... disoriented.
291092,L629992,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,"But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium."
291093,L629696,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,"Cole, did you or did you not record that message?"
291094,L629695,u8660,m587,ENGINEER,He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
291095,L629502,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,For a man in your position...an opportunity.
291096,L629501,u8660,m587,ENGINEER,"We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with ""unstable"" types."
291097,L629496,u8660,m587,ENGINEER,"You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?"
291098,L629495,u8654,m587,ASTROPHYSICIST,To be determined by the proper authorities.
291099,L630089,u8661,m587,FALE,"Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?"
291100,L630088,u8655,m587,BEN,"Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see."
291101,L630056,u8661,m587,FALE,"She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!"
291102,L630055,u8655,m587,BEN,What's she doing?
291103,L630054,u8661,m587,FALE,It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
291104,L629850,u8655,m587,BEN,What are you going to do with us?
291105,L629849,u8661,m587,FALE,That's him.
291106,L629842,u8661,m587,FALE,Shut up!
291107,L629841,u8655,m587,BEN,I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
291108,L630052,u8657,m587,COLE,"Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth."
291109,L630051,u8656,m587,BOTANIST,So that...???
291110,L630050,u8657,m587,COLE,To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
291111,L630049,u8656,m587,BOTANIST,And your only goal is...???
291112,L630048,u8657,m587,COLE,"That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking."
291113,L630047,u8656,m587,BOTANIST,Meaning...???
291114,L630046,u8657,m587,COLE,"San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking."
291115,L630045,u8656,m587,BOTANIST,And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
291116,L630044,u8657,m587,COLE,"It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995."
291117,L630043,u8656,m587,BOTANIST,"Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?"
291118,L629705,u8657,m587,COLE,"I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter."
291119,L629704,u8656,m587,BOTANIST,Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
291120,L629703,u8657,m587,COLE,They forced me to take drugs.
291121,L629485,u8657,m587,COLE,I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
291122,L629484,u8656,m587,BOTANIST,It's important to observe everything.
291123,L630221,u8666,m587,RAILLY,I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
291124,L630220,u8657,m587,COLE,Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
291125,L630219,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!"
291126,L630218,u8657,m587,COLE,"I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now."
291127,L630217,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room."
291128,L630215,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
291129,L630214,u8657,m587,COLE,I know this place! ... This is my dream.
291130,L630209,u8657,m587,COLE,"On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, ""We did it."""
291131,L630208,u8666,m587,RAILLY,That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
291132,L630200,u8666,m587,RAILLY,I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
291133,L630199,u8657,m587,COLE,I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
291134,L630198,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Well, you look pretty different, too."
291135,L630197,u8657,m587,COLE,You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
291136,L630191,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police."
291137,L630190,u8657,m587,COLE,But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
291138,L630189,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry."
291139,L630188,u8657,m587,COLE,Why are we doing this?
291140,L630186,u8657,m587,COLE,Flowers!  What flowers?
291141,L630185,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers."
291142,L630184,u8657,m587,COLE,"I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things."
291143,L630183,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
291144,L630182,u8657,m587,COLE,I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
291145,L630153,u8657,m587,COLE,"They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice."
291146,L630152,u8666,m587,RAILLY,You... you couldn't have heard me.
291147,L630150,u8666,m587,RAILLY,I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
291148,L630149,u8657,m587,COLE,You... you left them a message?
291149,L630148,u8666,m587,RAILLY,No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
291150,L630147,u8657,m587,COLE,A Carpet Cleaning Company?
291151,L630146,u8666,m587,RAILLY,It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
291152,L630133,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"I...I...We need cash, James."
291153,L630132,u8657,m587,COLE,You want me to rob him?
291154,L630123,u8666,m587,RAILLY,James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
291155,L630122,u8657,m587,COLE,I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
291156,L630121,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon."
291157,L630120,u8657,m587,COLE,You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
291158,L630119,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?"
291159,L630118,u8657,m587,COLE,...I had a dream about...something like that.
291160,L630117,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What does this mean to you?
291161,L630115,u8666,m587,RAILLY,IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
291162,L630114,u8657,m587,COLE,I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
291163,L630113,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"James, you said he was hiding in the barn..."
291164,L630112,u8657,m587,COLE,It was?  I didn't...know.
291165,L630111,u8666,m587,RAILLY,The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
291166,L630110,u8657,m587,COLE,I don't know -- I don't remember.
291167,L630109,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?"
291168,L630108,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said."
291169,L630107,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Just like that?  You were in prison?
291170,L630106,u8657,m587,COLE,I thought I was in...prison again.
291171,L630105,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
291172,L630098,u8657,m587,COLE,"You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them."
291173,L630097,u8666,m587,RAILLY,We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
291174,L630096,u8657,m587,COLE,I don't understand what we're doing.
291175,L630082,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well..."
291176,L630081,u8666,m587,RAILLY,James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
291177,L629962,u8657,m587,COLE,No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
291178,L629961,u8666,m587,RAILLY,You're sure?
291179,L629960,u8657,m587,COLE,The gun! ... I lost it
291180,L629959,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Give me the gun.
291181,L629958,u8657,m587,COLE,It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
291182,L629957,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?"
291183,L629956,u8657,m587,COLE,I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
291184,L629955,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you."
291185,L629954,u8657,m587,COLE,"I'm...""mentally divergent"".  I would love to believe that."
291186,L629953,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face."
291187,L629952,u8657,m587,COLE,"Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?"
291188,L629951,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What made you think that?
291189,L629950,u8657,m587,COLE,"Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!"
291190,L629949,u8666,m587,RAILLY,See -- you can drive after all!
291191,L629948,u8657,m587,COLE,No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
291192,L629947,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
291193,L629887,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You have to give yourself up, you know."
291194,L629886,u8657,m587,COLE,You smell so good.
291195,L629880,u8657,m587,COLE,That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
291196,L629879,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you."
291197,L629878,u8657,m587,COLE,"You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?"
291198,L629877,u8657,m587,COLE,"It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here."
291199,L629876,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Shot!  Who shot you?
291200,L629875,u8657,m587,COLE,I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
291201,L629874,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What's the matter with your leg?
291202,L629873,u8657,m587,COLE,I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
291203,L629872,u8666,m587,RAILLY,I thought you didn't know how to drive.
291204,L629871,u8657,m587,COLE,We need gas.
291205,L629868,u8666,m587,RAILLY,And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
291206,L629867,u8657,m587,COLE,The guy was a total fruitcake.
291207,L629866,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago."
291208,L629865,u8657,m587,COLE,All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
291209,L629844,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Jeffrey Mason?
291210,L629843,u8657,m587,COLE,Mason???
291211,L629840,u8657,m587,COLE,Lock it now!
291212,L629839,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"James, why don't we...?"
291213,L629838,u8657,m587,COLE,I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
291214,L629827,u8657,m587,COLE,I've got one now.
291215,L629826,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You didn't have a gun before, did you?"
291216,L629825,u8657,m587,COLE,I did him a favor.  Now come on.
291217,L629824,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!"
291218,L629821,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes..."
291219,L629820,u8657,m587,COLE,Are you hurt?
291220,L629814,u8657,m587,COLE,The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
291221,L629813,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Who's keeping an eye on you?
291222,L629812,u8657,m587,COLE,They're keeping an eye on me.
291223,L629809,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"I'm not going to ""do"" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is."
291224,L629808,u8657,m587,COLE,"Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!"
291225,L629804,u8657,m587,COLE,"Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!"
291226,L629803,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
291227,L629802,u8657,m587,COLE,"When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him."
291228,L629801,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?"
291229,L629797,u8657,m587,COLE,I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
291230,L629796,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
291231,L629795,u8657,m587,COLE,A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
291232,L629794,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Clues?  What kind of clues?
291233,L629793,u8657,m587,COLE,My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
291234,L629789,u8666,m587,RAILLY,You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
291235,L629788,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange."
291236,L629787,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me."
291237,L629786,u8657,m587,COLE,"You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before."
291238,L629785,u8666,m587,RAILLY,And I was in it?  What did I do?
291239,L629784,u8657,m587,COLE,About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
291240,L629783,u8666,m587,RAILLY,We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
291241,L629782,u8657,m587,COLE,"You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you."
291242,L629777,u8657,m587,COLE,"Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?"
291243,L629776,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
291244,L629775,u8657,m587,COLE,Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
291245,L629774,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"""If something really happens""...like what, James?"
291246,L629773,u8657,m587,COLE,"My father told me that.  ""Never cry wolf.""  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens."
291247,L629772,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What?
291248,L629771,u8657,m587,COLE,"""Never cry wolf!"""
291249,L629769,u8657,m587,COLE,Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
291250,L629768,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you."
291251,L629767,u8657,m587,COLE,"You used to call me ""James""."
291252,L629764,u8657,m587,COLE,"It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?"
291253,L629763,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?"
291254,L629762,u8657,m587,COLE,"You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?"
291255,L629761,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?"
291256,L629760,u8657,m587,COLE,1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
291257,L629759,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
291258,L629674,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"I have to do this, James.  You're very confused."
291259,L629673,u8657,m587,COLE,No more drugs.  Please...
291260,L629672,u8666,m587,RAILLY,It's just a shot to calm you.
291261,L629617,u8657,m587,COLE,Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
291262,L629616,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?"
291263,L629615,u8657,m587,COLE,What?
291264,L629614,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?"
291265,L629613,u8657,m587,COLE,No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
291266,L629612,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Perhaps it was a wrong number...
291267,L629611,u8657,m587,COLE,It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
291268,L629556,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989."
291269,L629555,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, 1995 is the past."
291270,L629554,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?"
291271,L629553,u8657,m587,COLE,1995?
291272,L629552,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What year do you think it is?
291273,L629551,u8657,m587,COLE,What year is it?
291274,L629550,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Do you know what year it is?
291275,L629549,u8657,m587,COLE,July?!
291276,L629548,u8666,m587,RAILLY,July.
291277,L629547,u8657,m587,COLE,"This is April, right?"
291278,L629546,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?"
291279,L629545,u8657,m587,COLE,I have to go.
291280,L629544,u8666,m587,RAILLY,You're afraid of germs?
291281,L629543,u8657,m587,COLE,It's so clean.  No germs.
291282,L629542,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"What's wonderful about the air, James?"
291283,L629541,u8657,m587,COLE,I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
291284,L629540,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Hiding?
291285,L629539,u8657,m587,COLE,Underground.
291286,L629538,u8666,m587,RAILLY,A jail?  Prison?
291287,L629537,u8657,m587,COLE,I have to go.
291288,L629536,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?"
291289,L629535,u8657,m587,COLE,You wouldn't understand.
291290,L629534,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Why not?  Most people have some ID.
291291,L629533,u8657,m587,COLE,No.
291292,L629532,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?"
291293,L629531,u8657,m587,COLE,They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
291294,L629530,u8666,m587,RAILLY,I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
291295,L629529,u8657,m587,COLE,Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
291296,L629528,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Do you know why you're here, James."
291297,L629527,u8657,m587,COLE,I need to go.
291298,L629526,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Change what?
291299,L629525,u8657,m587,COLE,It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
291300,L629524,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What kind of information?
291301,L629523,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information."
291302,L629522,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
291303,L629521,u8657,m587,COLE,"""James""!  Nobody ever calls me that."
291304,L629520,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you ""James""?"
291305,L629519,u8657,m587,COLE,I need to go now.
291306,L629518,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
291307,L629602,u8657,m587,COLE,"No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, ""voice mail"".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present."
291308,L629601,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
291309,L629600,u8657,m587,COLE,Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
291310,L629599,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?"
291311,L629598,u8657,m587,COLE,"No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out."
291312,L629597,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?"
291313,L629926,u8657,m587,COLE,"Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original..."
291314,L629925,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, ""Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"""
291315,L629924,u8657,m587,COLE,Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
291316,L629923,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, ""Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?""  You do remember that, don't you?"
291317,L629922,u8657,m587,COLE,Plan?  What are you talking about?
291318,L629921,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"I get it!  This is your old plan, right?"
291319,L629920,u8657,m587,COLE,I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
291320,L629918,u8657,m587,COLE,"I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!"
291321,L629917,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
291322,L629916,u8657,m587,COLE,Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
291323,L629915,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"County Hospital, right?  1989.  The ""Immaculate Escape"" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too."
291324,L629905,u8657,m587,COLE,Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
291325,L629904,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,Excuse me -- what did you say?
291326,L629903,u8657,m587,COLE,I'm here about some monkeys.
291327,L629902,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH."
291328,L629901,u8657,m587,COLE,You do know me.  You helped me once.
291329,L629900,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
291330,L629649,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"Not, ""what"", babe!  When!"
291331,L629648,u8657,m587,COLE,What...???
291332,L629647,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part."
291333,L629646,u8657,m587,COLE,What....???
291334,L629643,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
291335,L629642,u8657,m587,COLE,It's private.
291336,L629641,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,What're you writing?  You a reporter?
291337,L629640,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,You know -- your plan.
291338,L629639,u8657,m587,COLE,What are you talking about???
291339,L629638,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about ""you know what""."
291340,L629637,u8657,m587,COLE,"Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!"
291341,L629636,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
291342,L629635,u8657,m587,COLE,They hurt you!
291343,L629632,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS..."
291344,L629631,u8657,m587,COLE,What's that mean?
291345,L629630,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word."
291346,L629629,u8657,m587,COLE,"If you know how to escape, why don't you...?"
291347,L629628,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?"
291348,L629627,u8657,m587,COLE,I'm not crazy.
291349,L629626,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"""What about the germs?""  I say.  He goes, ""I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!"" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?"
291350,L629625,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible ""bad things"" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...""germs""!"
291351,L629624,u8657,m587,COLE,Germs?!
291352,L629574,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND..."
291353,L629573,u8657,m587,COLE,I need to make a telephone call.
291354,L629572,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
291355,L630251,u8657,m587,COLE,Who am I supposed to shoot?
291356,L630250,u8664,m587,JOSE,"They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?"
291357,L630249,u8657,m587,COLE,"It's about obeying, about doing what you're told."
291358,L630248,u8664,m587,JOSE,"Hey, man..."
291359,L630247,u8657,m587,COLE,"This part isn't about the virus, is it?"
291360,L630241,u8664,m587,JOSE,"Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... ""weird"" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!"
291361,L630240,u8657,m587,COLE,The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
291362,L630239,u8664,m587,JOSE,"The phone call, man.  The phone call."
291363,L630238,u8657,m587,COLE,How did you find me?
291364,L630237,u8664,m587,JOSE,"Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!"
291365,L630235,u8664,m587,JOSE,"Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this."
291366,L630234,u8657,m587,COLE,Jo...Jose????
291367,L629737,u8664,m587,JOSE,"Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?"
291368,L629736,u8657,m587,COLE,JOSE!

291370,L630030,u8665,m587,MICROBIOLOGIST,But you know what's real now?
291371,L629699,u8657,m587,COLE,I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
291372,L629698,u8665,m587,MICROBIOLOGIST,"It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?"
291373,L629697,u8657,m587,COLE,"Uh, that message...me?"
291374,L629491,u8657,m587,COLE,"Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered."
291375,L629490,u8665,m587,MICROBIOLOGIST,"I asked you, why did you volunteer?"
291376,L629481,u8665,m587,MICROBIOLOGIST,"We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw."
291377,L629480,u8657,m587,COLE,"I mashed the spider, didn't I?"
291378,L630013,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"And what we believe is what's accepted as ""truth"" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith."
291379,L630012,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not."
291380,L630011,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!"
291381,L630010,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress."
291382,L629687,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?"
291383,L629686,u8666,m587,RAILLY,He was fully sedated!
291384,L629681,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?"
291385,L629680,u8666,m587,RAILLY,I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
291386,L629679,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
291387,L629678,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and..."
291388,L629677,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?"
291389,L629676,u8666,m587,RAILLY,I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
291390,L629675,u8658,m587,DR. FLETCHER,"Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition."

291393,L630177,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"You ""develop"" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever ""developed"" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!"
291394,L630176,u8659,m587,DR. MASON,"You're insane, Jeffrey."
291395,L630175,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"What virus are we talking about, Dad?"
291396,L630174,u8659,m587,DR. MASON,"She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this."
291397,L630173,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,What...virus?
291398,L630091,u8661,m587,FALE,Then how come she knows what's going on?
291399,L630090,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,"WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!

291403,L630075,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
291404,L630071,u8661,m587,FALE,No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
291405,L630070,u8663,m587,JEFFREY,You really want to know?

291407,L629517,u8662,m587,FRANKI,I'll be right here...just in case.
291408,L629516,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"No, thank you."
291409,L629515,u8662,m587,FRANKI,"James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?"
291410,L629514,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"Yes, please.  You said he gave a name..."
291411,L629513,u8662,m587,FRANKI,You want to go in?  Examine him?
291412,L629512,u8666,m587,RAILLY,"That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle."
291413,L629511,u8662,m587,FRANKI,"Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet."
291414,L629510,u8666,m587,RAILLY,You have him in restraints.
291415,L629509,u8662,m587,FRANKI,Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
291416,L629508,u8666,m587,RAILLY,He's been tested for drugs?
291417,L629507,u8662,m587,FRANKI,"-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him..."
291418,L630206,u8667,m587,WOMAN CABBIE,"Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning."
291419,L630205,u8666,m587,RAILLY,What?  What did you say?
291420,L630204,u8667,m587,WOMAN CABBIE,"On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor."
291421,L630203,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
291422,L630202,u8667,m587,WOMAN CABBIE,Might be tight.
291423,L630201,u8666,m587,RAILLY,Nine thirty
291424,L633021,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
291425,L633020,u8677,m588,JOHN,Any parting words of wisdom?
291426,L633019,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Same back at you.
291427,L633018,u8677,m588,JOHN,No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
291428,L633017,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
291429,L633016,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Not this twig, friend.  I got plans."
291430,L633015,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,More or less.
291431,L633014,u8677,m588,JOHN,"We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?"
291432,L633013,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars."
291433,L633012,u8677,m588,JOHN,You don't fear death?
291434,L633011,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same."
291435,L633010,u8677,m588,JOHN,You afraid of the dark?
291436,L633009,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of."
291437,L633008,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You're a hell of a pessimist, old man."
291438,L633007,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark."
291439,L633006,u8677,m588,JOHN,The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
291440,L632811,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,I won't hold my breath.
291441,L632810,u8677,m588,JOHN,I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
291442,L632809,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
291443,L632808,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Think you'll live that long?
291444,L632807,u8677,m588,JOHN,Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
291445,L632806,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
291446,L632805,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man."
291447,L632804,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,What do you want for free?
291448,L632803,u8677,m588,JOHN,I think I've heard that before.
291449,L632802,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are."
291450,L632801,u8677,m588,JOHN,Maybe I do.
291451,L632800,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
291452,L632799,u8677,m588,JOHN,That a fact?
291453,L632798,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
291454,L632797,u8677,m588,JOHN,You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
291455,L632256,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . ."
291456,L632255,u8677,m588,JOHN,He no!
291457,L632254,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
291458,L632253,u8677,m588,JOHN,What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
291459,L632252,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?"
291460,L632251,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Oh, Jesus."
291461,L632250,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,That's 'cause he's dead.
291462,L632249,u8677,m588,JOHN,I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
291463,L632246,u8677,m588,JOHN,Christ!
291464,L632245,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
291465,L632244,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, yeah."
291466,L632243,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
291467,L632242,u8677,m588,JOHN,"All right, old man.  Christ."
291468,L632241,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
291469,L632240,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, sure.  You got change?"
291470,L632239,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
291471,L632238,u8677,m588,JOHN,I said I was sorry.
291472,L632237,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
291473,L632236,u8677,m588,JOHN,Christ no!
291474,L632235,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
291475,L632234,u8677,m588,JOHN,I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
291476,L632233,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
291477,L632232,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I'm sorry, I didn't--"
291478,L632231,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?"
291479,L632230,u8677,m588,JOHN,You can't do that yourself?
291480,L632229,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
291481,L632228,u8677,m588,JOHN,You want something?
291482,L632227,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,"Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?"
291483,L632226,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You want something, old man?"
291484,L632225,u8668,m588,BLIND MAN,Hey!  You there!
291485,L632578,u8677,m588,JOHN,I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
291486,L632577,u8669,m588,BOYD,That's my morning's pay.
291487,L632576,u8677,m588,JOHN,Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
291488,L632562,u8677,m588,JOHN,Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
291489,L632561,u8669,m588,BOYD,"Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?"
291490,L632560,u8677,m588,JOHN,It's a Movado.
291491,L632559,u8677,m588,JOHN,I'll bet my watch against your pay.
291492,L632558,u8669,m588,BOYD,You want to make a kiddies bet?
291493,L632557,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nothing.
291494,L632556,u8669,m588,BOYD,"Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?"
291495,L632555,u8677,m588,JOHN,I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
291496,L632552,u8669,m588,BOYD,Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
291497,L632551,u8672,m588,ED,I got more brains than you've got teeth.
291498,L632550,u8669,m588,BOYD,And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
291499,L632549,u8672,m588,ED,No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
291500,L632548,u8669,m588,BOYD,It will.
291501,L632547,u8672,m588,ED,A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
291502,L632546,u8669,m588,BOYD,It is not.
291503,L632545,u8672,m588,ED,It's nonsense.
291504,L632540,u8669,m588,BOYD,You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
291505,L632539,u8672,m588,ED,You ain't nothing but an old fool.
291506,L632538,u8669,m588,BOYD,Will be.
291507,L632537,u8672,m588,ED,Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
291508,L632536,u8669,m588,BOYD,Hundred and eight already.
291509,L632535,u8672,m588,ED,One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
291510,L632945,u8670,m588,CLERK,"I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please."
291511,L632944,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave."
291512,L632943,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah.  Just a little short. Figures.  I just wanted to get out, that's all."
291513,L632942,u8670,m588,CLERK,"I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket."
291514,L632941,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty."
291515,L632940,u8670,m588,CLERK,The ticket is thirty dollars.
291516,L632939,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got."
291517,L632938,u8670,m588,CLERK,Thirty even.
291518,L632937,u8677,m588,JOHN,One way.
291519,L632936,u8670,m588,CLERK,"One way, or round trip?"
291520,L632935,u8677,m588,JOHN,How much.
291521,L632934,u8670,m588,CLERK,"We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border."
291522,L632933,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I don't care, just get me there."
291523,L632932,u8670,m588,CLERK,Where in Mexico would you like--
291524,L632931,u8677,m588,JOHN,I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
291525,L632930,u8670,m588,CLERK,"But, in particular?"
291526,L632929,u8677,m588,JOHN,Out of here.
291527,L632928,u8670,m588,CLERK,Where to?
291528,L632927,u8677,m588,JOHN,I need a ticket.
291529,L632926,u8670,m588,CLERK,"Can I help you, sir?"
291530,L633145,u8677,m588,JOHN,Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
291531,L633144,u8671,m588,DARRELL,I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
291532,L633143,u8677,m588,JOHN,What's it to you?
291533,L633142,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
291534,L633141,u8671,m588,DARRELL,You got the money?
291535,L633140,u8677,m588,JOHN,I want my car.
291536,L633139,u8671,m588,DARRELL,What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
291537,L633138,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Come back when the sun comes up.
291538,L633137,u8677,m588,JOHN,It is morning.
291539,L633136,u8671,m588,DARRELL,We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
291540,L633135,u8677,m588,JOHN,Open up!
291541,L633134,u8671,m588,DARRELL,What you want?
291542,L632922,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"There you go, sweet talking me again."
291543,L632921,u8677,m588,JOHN,Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
291544,L632919,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Yeah, you better remember that."
291545,L632918,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Please, just leave the car alone."
291546,L632917,u8671,m588,DARRELL,What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
291547,L632916,u8677,m588,JOHN,No!
291548,L632914,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage."
291549,L632913,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!"
291550,L632912,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
291551,L632911,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car."
291552,L632910,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
291553,L632909,u8677,m588,JOHN,"What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick."
291554,L632908,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation."
291555,L632907,u8677,m588,JOHN,I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
291556,L632906,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Yeah, but it was shot."
291557,L632905,u8677,m588,JOHN,I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
291558,L632904,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
291559,L632903,u8677,m588,JOHN,You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
291560,L632902,u8671,m588,DARRELL,It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
291561,L632901,u8677,m588,JOHN,What?
291562,L632900,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Two-hundred.
291563,L632899,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--"
291564,L632898,u8671,m588,DARRELL,No charge.
291565,L632897,u8677,m588,JOHN,"That's a good piece of advice, Darrell."
291566,L632896,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"You think bad, and bad is what you get."
291567,L632895,u8677,m588,JOHN,You believe that?
291568,L632894,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out."
291569,L632893,u8677,m588,JOHN,You've been there?
291570,L632892,u8671,m588,DARRELL,One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
291571,L632891,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit."
291572,L632890,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
291573,L632500,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars."
291574,L632499,u8677,m588,JOHN,You son of a bitch!
291575,L632498,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
291576,L632497,u8677,m588,JOHN,I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
291577,L632496,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split."
291578,L632494,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had."
291579,L632493,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Then you ain't gonna have the car.
291580,L632492,u8677,m588,JOHN,"It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money."
291581,L632491,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars."
291582,L632490,u8677,m588,JOHN,What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
291583,L632489,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
291584,L632488,u8677,m588,JOHN,"That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?"
291585,L632487,u8671,m588,DARRELL,That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
291586,L632486,u8677,m588,JOHN,"About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone."
291587,L632485,u8671,m588,DARRELL,A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
291588,L632484,u8677,m588,JOHN,To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
291589,L632483,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Hundred-fifty.
291590,L632482,u8677,m588,JOHN,How much!?
291591,L632481,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks."
291592,L632480,u8677,m588,JOHN,How much?
291593,L632479,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now."
291594,L632478,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Look, I just want to pick up my car."
291595,L632477,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
291596,L632476,u8677,m588,JOHN,Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
291597,L632475,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Don't look like nothing.
291598,L632474,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nothing.
291599,L632473,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you."
291600,L632472,u8677,m588,JOHN,Hey.
291601,L632223,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Just a car.
291602,L632222,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?"
291603,L632221,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it."
291604,L632220,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?"
291605,L632219,u8671,m588,DARRELL,You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
291606,L632218,u8677,m588,JOHN,Accident.
291607,L632216,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
291608,L632215,u8677,m588,JOHN,Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
291609,L632214,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Twenty-after-ten.
291610,L632213,u8677,m588,JOHN,What time is it now?
291611,L632212,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Time.
291612,L632211,u8677,m588,JOHN,How much time?
291613,L632210,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time."
291614,L632209,u8677,m588,JOHN,Hey!
291615,L632208,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?"
291616,L632207,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
291617,L632206,u8677,m588,JOHN,"If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?"
291618,L632205,u8671,m588,DARRELL,"Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?"
291619,L632204,u8677,m588,JOHN,I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
291620,L632203,u8671,m588,DARRELL,It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
291621,L632202,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted."
291622,L632201,u8671,m588,DARRELL,That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
291623,L632200,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
291624,L632199,u8677,m588,JOHN,You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
291625,L632198,u8671,m588,DARRELL,So?
291626,L632197,u8677,m588,JOHN,But he's dead.
291627,L632196,u8671,m588,DARRELL,'Cause Harlin used to own it.
291628,L632195,u8677,m588,JOHN,Then why do you call it Harlin's?
291629,L632194,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Yep.
291630,L632193,u8677,m588,JOHN,You own this place?
291631,L632192,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
291632,L632191,u8677,m588,JOHN,Will he be back soon?
291633,L632190,u8671,m588,DARRELL,He's up at the Look Out.
291634,L632189,u8677,m588,JOHN,Harlin around?
291635,L632188,u8671,m588,DARRELL,Nope.  Darrell.
291636,L632187,u8677,m588,JOHN,You Harlin?
291637,L632186,u8671,m588,DARRELL,You want somethin'?
291638,L632664,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, I'll try."
291639,L632663,u8673,m588,FLO,"Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day."
291640,L632591,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, give me the Miller."
291641,L632590,u8673,m588,FLO,"No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?"
291642,L632589,u8677,m588,JOHN,Genuine Draft?
291643,L632588,u8673,m588,FLO,"No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller."
291644,L632587,u8677,m588,JOHN,Kirin?
291645,L632586,u8673,m588,FLO,We ain't got no Beck's.
291646,L632585,u8677,m588,JOHN,Let me have a Beck's.
291647,L632584,u8673,m588,FLO,What would a truck stop be without beer?
291648,L632583,u8677,m588,JOHN,You got beer?
291649,L632582,u8673,m588,FLO,"Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?"
291650,L632662,u8673,m588,FLO,"It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up."
291651,L632661,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,I think I burned my gun hand!
291652,L632660,u8673,m588,FLO,Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
291653,L632658,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee."
291654,L632657,u8673,m588,FLO,Let me get your change.
291655,L632651,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died."
291656,L632650,u8673,m588,FLO,Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
291657,L632647,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
291658,L632646,u8673,m588,FLO,Poor thing.  Is she all right?
291659,L632642,u8673,m588,FLO,"You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?"

291661,L632640,u8673,m588,FLO,You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
291662,L632639,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,What was that all about?
291663,L633220,u8674,m588,GRACE,Sheriff Potter.
291664,L633219,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
291665,L633217,u8674,m588,GRACE,John--
291666,L633216,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there."
291667,L633202,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Can't I?  You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk.  What do you think, boy?"
291668,L633201,u8674,m588,GRACE,Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
291669,L633200,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,". . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?"
291670,L633194,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
291671,L633193,u8674,m588,GRACE,What do you want?
291672,L633192,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
291673,L633185,u8674,m588,GRACE,"He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too."
291674,L633184,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money."
291675,L633182,u8674,m588,GRACE,John . . .
291676,L633181,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?"
291677,L633169,u8674,m588,GRACE,I . . .
291678,L633168,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?"
291679,L633167,u8674,m588,GRACE,I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
291680,L633166,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Taking a little trip?
291681,L633165,u8674,m588,GRACE,Yes.  Yes it is.
291682,L633164,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"That yours, Mrs. McKenna?"
291683,L633036,u8674,m588,GRACE,Jake.  No.  No!
291684,L633035,u8675,m588,JAKE,What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
291685,L633034,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there."
291686,L633033,u8674,m588,GRACE,When did you buy a gun?
291687,L633032,u8675,m588,JAKE,What does it look like?
291688,L633031,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Jake, what is that?"
291689,L633030,u8675,m588,JAKE,The wind isn't blowing.
291690,L633029,u8674,m588,GRACE,I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
291691,L633028,u8675,m588,JAKE,There's someone in the house.
291692,L633027,u8674,m588,GRACE,How could I?  I was sleeping.
291693,L633026,u8675,m588,JAKE,You didn't hear something?
291694,L633025,u8674,m588,GRACE,What's the matter?
291695,L633004,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing."
291696,L633003,u8675,m588,JAKE,"What the hell you looking at, girl?"
291697,L633002,u8675,m588,JAKE,Uh-huh
291698,L633001,u8674,m588,GRACE,"I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors."
291699,L633000,u8675,m588,JAKE,They look nice.
291700,L632999,u8674,m588,GRACE,You haven't even looked at them once.
291701,L632998,u8675,m588,JAKE,They look nice.
291702,L632997,u8674,m588,GRACE,You never said anything.  About the drapes.
291703,L632996,u8675,m588,JAKE,I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
291704,L632995,u8674,m588,GRACE,"I put up new drapes, Jake."
291705,L632994,u8675,m588,JAKE,"You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?"
291706,L632993,u8674,m588,GRACE,Wrong number.
291707,L632992,u8675,m588,JAKE,Who was that on the phone?
291708,L632376,u8675,m588,JAKE,Who the hell is this!?
291709,L632375,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear."
291710,L633301,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?"
291711,L633300,u8677,m588,JOHN,"What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so."
291712,L633299,u8674,m588,GRACE,"For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!"
291713,L633298,u8677,m588,JOHN,"At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?"
291714,L633297,u8674,m588,GRACE,You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
291715,L633296,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead."
291716,L633295,u8674,m588,GRACE,Someone will find me.
291717,L633294,u8677,m588,JOHN,Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
291718,L633293,u8674,m588,GRACE,"John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here."
291719,L633292,u8677,m588,JOHN,Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
291720,L633291,u8674,m588,GRACE,Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
291721,L633290,u8677,m588,JOHN,"And you're not one to lie, are you?"
291722,L633289,u8674,m588,GRACE,No.  I swear it.
291723,L633288,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here."
291724,L633287,u8674,m588,GRACE,I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
291725,L633286,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You closed it, didn't you, Grace?"
291726,L633285,u8674,m588,GRACE,It's . . . it's locked.
291727,L633284,u8677,m588,JOHN,It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
291728,L633283,u8674,m588,GRACE,The trunk.  It's locked.
291729,L633282,u8677,m588,JOHN,What for?
291730,L633281,u8674,m588,GRACE,"John, throw me the keys."
291731,L633280,u8674,m588,GRACE,"John, you have to throw the keys up to me."
291732,L633279,u8677,m588,JOHN,Where the hell am I going to go?
291733,L633278,u8674,m588,GRACE,John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
291734,L633277,u8674,m588,GRACE,I'll get it.
291735,L633276,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up."
291736,L633275,u8674,m588,GRACE,I'm here.
291737,L633274,u8677,m588,JOHN,I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
291738,L633273,u8674,m588,GRACE,Can you climb back up.
291739,L633272,u8677,m588,JOHN,I think I busted my leg.
291740,L633271,u8674,m588,GRACE,Are you all right?
291741,L633270,u8677,m588,JOHN,Grace!
291742,L633269,u8674,m588,GRACE,John!
291743,L633262,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care."
291744,L633261,u8674,m588,GRACE,"I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?"
291745,L633260,u8677,m588,JOHN,Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
291746,L633259,u8674,m588,GRACE,"But I want to say with you,"
291747,L633258,u8677,m588,JOHN,The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
291748,L633257,u8674,m588,GRACE,He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
291749,L633256,u8677,m588,JOHN,"<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never."
291750,L633255,u8674,m588,GRACE,What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
291751,L633254,u8677,m588,JOHN,Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
291752,L633253,u8674,m588,GRACE,But you said we could be together.
291753,L633252,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own."
291754,L633251,u8674,m588,GRACE,Now what?
291755,L633250,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Well, nothing."
291756,L633242,u8677,m588,JOHN,You could give me the gun.
291757,L633241,u8674,m588,GRACE,Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
291758,L633238,u8677,m588,JOHN,You killed a man for no reason!
291759,L633237,u8674,m588,GRACE,You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
291760,L633236,u8677,m588,JOHN,I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
291761,L633235,u8674,m588,GRACE,He was going to--
291762,L633234,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?"
291763,L633230,u8674,m588,GRACE,Just drive.
291764,L633229,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?"
291765,L633228,u8674,m588,GRACE,It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
291766,L633227,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him."
291767,L633226,u8674,m588,GRACE,He was going to take the money.
291768,L633225,u8677,m588,JOHN,You killed him!
291769,L633224,u8674,m588,GRACE,I shot him.
291770,L633215,u8677,m588,JOHN,"He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars."
291771,L633214,u8674,m588,GRACE,"He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in."
291772,L633213,u8677,m588,JOHN,You heard me.  Count it out.
291773,L633212,u8674,m588,GRACE,What?
291774,L633211,u8677,m588,JOHN,Give him the money.
291775,L633210,u8674,m588,GRACE,It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
291776,L633209,u8677,m588,JOHN,Not me.  Us.
291777,L633208,u8674,m588,GRACE,That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
291778,L633205,u8677,m588,JOHN,"No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone."
291779,L633204,u8674,m588,GRACE,Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
291780,L633203,u8677,m588,JOHN,One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
291781,L633191,u8677,m588,JOHN,You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
291782,L633190,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it."
291783,L633180,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant."
291784,L633179,u8674,m588,GRACE,John . . .?
291785,L633154,u8677,m588,JOHN,Funny thing.
291786,L633153,u8674,m588,GRACE,Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
291787,L633152,u8677,m588,JOHN,Yeah.  Good thinking.
291788,L633151,u8674,m588,GRACE,I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
291789,L633150,u8677,m588,JOHN,I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
291790,L633149,u8674,m588,GRACE,John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
291791,L633133,u8677,m588,JOHN,Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
291792,L633132,u8674,m588,GRACE,Wait.  What about . . . him?
291793,L633131,u8677,m588,JOHN,To get my car.
291794,L633130,u8674,m588,GRACE,Where are you going?
291795,L633129,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you."
291796,L633128,u8674,m588,GRACE,Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
291797,L633127,u8677,m588,JOHN,You got a suitcase?
291798,L633125,u8674,m588,GRACE,Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
291799,L633124,u8677,m588,JOHN,What about him?
291800,L633123,u8674,m588,GRACE,Let's do it here.
291801,L633122,u8674,m588,GRACE,No.
291802,L633121,u8677,m588,JOHN,Let's go in the bedroom.
291803,L633120,u8677,m588,JOHN,We're going all the way.  Together.
291804,L633119,u8674,m588,GRACE,If you want.
291805,L633117,u8674,m588,GRACE,I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
291806,L633116,u8677,m588,JOHN,There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
291807,L633110,u8674,m588,GRACE,Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
291808,L633109,u8677,m588,JOHN,You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
291809,L633108,u8674,m588,GRACE,"If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?"
291810,L633107,u8677,m588,JOHN,This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
291811,L633106,u8674,m588,GRACE,"It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left."
291812,L633105,u8677,m588,JOHN,There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
291813,L633104,u8674,m588,GRACE,There has to be!
291814,L633103,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
291815,L633099,u8674,m588,GRACE,Don't yell at me!
291816,L633098,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!"
291817,L633097,u8674,m588,GRACE,I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
291818,L633096,u8677,m588,JOHN,You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
291819,L633095,u8674,m588,GRACE,I don't know.
291820,L633094,u8677,m588,JOHN,Where's the safe?
291821,L633091,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls."
291822,L633090,u8674,m588,GRACE,What was I supposed to do?
291823,L633089,u8677,m588,JOHN,Why the hell didn't you do anything?
291824,L632991,u8674,m588,GRACE,After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
291825,L632990,u8677,m588,JOHN,Grace . . . Grace?
291826,L632988,u8677,m588,JOHN,We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
291827,L632987,u8674,m588,GRACE,You said you couldn't kill anybody.
291828,L632986,u8677,m588,JOHN,"The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out."
291829,L632985,u8677,m588,JOHN,I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
291830,L632984,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Are you sure?  About me, I mean?"
291831,L632983,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that."
291832,L632982,u8674,m588,GRACE,Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
291833,L632981,u8677,m588,JOHN,I could if I had Jake's money.
291834,L632980,u8674,m588,GRACE,I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
291835,L632979,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me."
291836,L632978,u8674,m588,GRACE,Because I know you're full of shit.
291837,L632977,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?"
291838,L632976,u8674,m588,GRACE,Stop it.
291839,L632975,u8677,m588,JOHN,I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
291840,L632974,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace."
291841,L632973,u8674,m588,GRACE,"There is no us, remember?"
291842,L632972,u8677,m588,JOHN,What about us?
291843,L632971,u8674,m588,GRACE,I don't think we have anything to talk about.
291844,L632970,u8677,m588,JOHN,I wanted to talk.
291845,L632969,u8674,m588,GRACE,I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
291846,L632791,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it."
291847,L632790,u8674,m588,GRACE,It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
291848,L632789,u8677,m588,JOHN,Shit!
291849,L632787,u8674,m588,GRACE,Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
291850,L632786,u8677,m588,JOHN,Kill someone.  I can't do it.
291851,L632785,u8674,m588,GRACE,What are you talking about?
291852,L632784,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it."
291853,L632783,u8674,m588,GRACE,"John, please--"
291854,L632782,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place."
291855,L632781,u8674,m588,GRACE,John?  John where are you going?
291856,L632780,u8674,m588,GRACE,We'd have to kill him.
291857,L632779,u8677,m588,JOHN,"If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . ."
291858,L632778,u8674,m588,GRACE,It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
291859,L632777,u8677,m588,JOHN,I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
291860,L632776,u8674,m588,GRACE,Lied?  What do you mean?
291861,L632775,u8677,m588,JOHN,One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
291862,L632774,u8674,m588,GRACE,Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
291863,L632773,u8677,m588,JOHN,How much money has he got?
291864,L632772,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage."
291865,L632771,u8677,m588,JOHN,You live pretty good.
291866,L632770,u8674,m588,GRACE,"He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me."
291867,L632769,u8677,m588,JOHN,From?
291868,L632768,u8674,m588,GRACE,He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
291869,L632767,u8677,m588,JOHN,You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
291870,L632766,u8674,m588,GRACE,Jake.
291871,L632765,u8677,m588,JOHN,Where?
291872,L632764,u8674,m588,GRACE,I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
291873,L632763,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic."
291874,L632762,u8674,m588,GRACE,Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
291875,L632761,u8677,m588,JOHN,I can't.
291876,L632760,u8674,m588,GRACE,Take me with you.
291877,L632759,u8677,m588,JOHN,Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
291878,L632758,u8674,m588,GRACE,Is it pretty?
291879,L632757,u8677,m588,JOHN,Yeah.
291880,L632756,u8674,m588,GRACE,Have you ever been there before?
291881,L632755,u8677,m588,JOHN,From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
291882,L632754,u8674,m588,GRACE,How far is it to California?
291883,L632749,u8677,m588,JOHN,Whatever it takes.
291884,L632748,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out."
291885,L632747,u8677,m588,JOHN,You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
291886,L632746,u8674,m588,GRACE,It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
291887,L632745,u8677,m588,JOHN,You just walk away.
291888,L632744,u8674,m588,GRACE,I don't know how.
291889,L632743,u8677,m588,JOHN,You could just leave him.
291890,L632742,u8674,m588,GRACE,"All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole."
291891,L632741,u8674,m588,GRACE,"I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?"
291892,L632740,u8677,m588,JOHN,And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
291893,L632739,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
291894,L632738,u8677,m588,JOHN,I'm guessing no.
291895,L632737,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?"
291896,L632736,u8677,m588,JOHN,Did you ever?
291897,L632735,u8674,m588,GRACE,No.
291898,L632734,u8677,m588,JOHN,You love him?
291899,L632733,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way."
291900,L632732,u8677,m588,JOHN,Doesn't the heat bother you?
291901,L632387,u8674,m588,GRACE,"If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true."
291902,L632386,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Damn it, Grace!  Tell him."
291903,L632373,u8674,m588,GRACE,Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
291904,L632372,u8677,m588,JOHN,You know what I want.
291905,L632371,u8674,m588,GRACE,That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
291906,L632370,u8677,m588,JOHN,Still playing?
291907,L632369,u8674,m588,GRACE,You never did answer my question.
291908,L632368,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade."
291909,L632367,u8674,m588,GRACE,Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
291910,L632366,u8677,m588,JOHN,I think I can find my own way back to into town.
291911,L632365,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?"
291912,L632364,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around."
291913,L632363,u8674,m588,GRACE,Games?
291914,L632362,u8677,m588,JOHN,"All right, Grace.  No more games."
291915,L632361,u8674,m588,GRACE,Such as?
291916,L632360,u8677,m588,JOHN,I have ideas.
291917,L632359,u8674,m588,GRACE,No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
291918,L632358,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nothing like a little liveliness.
291919,L632357,u8674,m588,GRACE,I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
291920,L632356,u8677,m588,JOHN,Like they're made of polyester.
291921,L632355,u8674,m588,GRACE,Beautiful?
291922,L632354,u8677,m588,JOHN,Like you.
291923,L632353,u8674,m588,GRACE,You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
291924,L632352,u8674,m588,GRACE,Lift me down.
291925,L632351,u8677,m588,JOHN,What?
291926,L632350,u8674,m588,GRACE,There.  All done.  Lift me down.
291927,L632346,u8677,m588,JOHN,The same thing you do.
291928,L632345,u8674,m588,GRACE,"It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?"
291929,L632344,u8677,m588,JOHN,My face tell you all that?
291930,L632342,u8674,m588,GRACE,Come here.
291931,L632341,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
291932,L632340,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Those are white words, not ours."
291933,L632339,u8677,m588,JOHN,A medicine man?
291934,L632338,u8674,m588,GRACE,From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
291935,L632337,u8677,m588,JOHN,Where'd you learn to do that?
291936,L632336,u8674,m588,GRACE,"A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes."
291937,L632335,u8677,m588,JOHN,What do you do anyway?
291938,L632334,u8674,m588,GRACE,I guess it must.
291939,L632333,u8677,m588,JOHN,Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
291940,L632332,u8674,m588,GRACE,Thank you.
291941,L632331,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nice place you got here.
291942,L632330,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Good, 'cause I liked what I saw."
291943,L632329,u8677,m588,JOHN,I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
291944,L632328,u8674,m588,GRACE,Did you like it; me watching you?
291945,L632327,u8677,m588,JOHN,I didn't say it bothered me.
291946,L632326,u8674,m588,GRACE,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
291947,L632325,u8677,m588,JOHN,That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
291948,L632319,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out."
291949,L632318,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing."
291950,L632317,u8677,m588,JOHN,I pack up and go somewhere else.
291951,L632316,u8674,m588,GRACE,What happens if you lose?
291952,L632315,u8677,m588,JOHN,"If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes."
291953,L632314,u8674,m588,GRACE,"You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances."
291954,L632313,u8677,m588,JOHN,I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
291955,L632312,u8674,m588,GRACE,Where you headed?
291956,L632311,u8677,m588,JOHN,I guess I've got wander in my blood.
291957,L632310,u8674,m588,GRACE,You've been around.
291958,L632309,u8677,m588,JOHN,"All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque."
291959,L632308,u8674,m588,GRACE,Where you coming from?
291960,L632305,u8674,m588,GRACE,And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
291961,L632304,u8677,m588,JOHN,Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
291962,L632303,u8674,m588,GRACE,Least you can leave.
291963,L632302,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert."
291964,L632301,u8674,m588,GRACE,Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
291965,L632300,u8677,m588,JOHN,Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
291966,L632299,u8674,m588,GRACE,Drove into Sierra?  What for?
291967,L632298,u8677,m588,JOHN,I just drove in this morning.
291968,L632297,u8674,m588,GRACE,You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
291969,L632296,u8677,m588,JOHN,Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
291970,L632295,u8674,m588,GRACE,"You're not from around here, are you?"
291971,L632294,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You're welcome, Grace."
291972,L632293,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Thank you, John."
291973,L632291,u8677,m588,JOHN,I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
291974,L632290,u8674,m588,GRACE,"'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things."
291975,L632289,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yes, I have."
291976,L632288,u8674,m588,GRACE,"I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?"
291977,L632287,u8677,m588,JOHN,That a fact?
291978,L632286,u8674,m588,GRACE,I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
291979,L632285,u8677,m588,JOHN,It's nothing.  Really.
291980,L632283,u8677,m588,JOHN,That's all right.  I got it.
291981,L632282,u8674,m588,GRACE,"Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up."
291982,L632281,u8677,m588,JOHN,Wasn't nothing.
291983,L632280,u8677,m588,JOHN,"No trouble at all, really."
291984,L632279,u8674,m588,GRACE,"It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot."
291985,L632278,u8674,m588,GRACE,You should be more careful.
291986,L632277,u8677,m588,JOHN,Accident.
291987,L632276,u8674,m588,GRACE,What happened to your hand?
291988,L632275,u8677,m588,JOHN,"No, I've got it."
291989,L632273,u8674,m588,GRACE,Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
291990,L632272,u8677,m588,JOHN,I got it.
291991,L632271,u8674,m588,GRACE,You sure you can manage?
291992,L632270,u8677,m588,JOHN,Jesus.
291993,L632269,u8677,m588,JOHN,"May I carry your package, Grace?"
291994,L632268,u8674,m588,GRACE,It's Grace.
291995,L632267,u8677,m588,JOHN,"My cup runneth over, beauti--"
291996,L632266,u8674,m588,GRACE,"You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?"
291997,L632265,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking."
291998,L632264,u8674,m588,GRACE,Maybe I don't want you to.
291999,L632263,u8677,m588,JOHN,I don't know your real name.
292000,L632262,u8674,m588,GRACE,Do you have to call me that?
292001,L632261,u8677,m588,JOHN,"My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?"
292002,L632260,u8674,m588,GRACE,My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
292003,L632259,u8677,m588,JOHN,That's right on my way.
292004,L632258,u8674,m588,GRACE,I'm just going to my car.
292005,L632257,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Can I give you a hand, beautiful?"
292006,L633086,u8677,m588,JOHN,Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
292007,L633085,u8675,m588,JAKE,Two-hundred dollars.
292008,L633084,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with."
292009,L633083,u8675,m588,JAKE,You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
292010,L633082,u8677,m588,JOHN,Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
292011,L633081,u8675,m588,JAKE,What are you babbling about?
292012,L633080,u8677,m588,JOHN,"It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money."
292013,L633079,u8675,m588,JAKE,Not from where I stand.
292014,L633078,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake."
292015,L633077,u8675,m588,JAKE,You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
292016,L633076,u8677,m588,JOHN,What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
292017,L633075,u8675,m588,JAKE,"A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me."
292018,L633074,u8677,m588,JOHN,What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
292019,L633073,u8675,m588,JAKE,Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
292020,L633072,u8677,m588,JOHN,You're not talking sense.
292021,L633071,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?"
292022,L633070,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Christ, Jake, please--"
292023,L633069,u8675,m588,JAKE,Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
292024,L633068,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
292025,L633067,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company."
292026,L633066,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Come on, Jake--"
292027,L633065,u8675,m588,JAKE,"This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it."
292028,L633064,u8677,m588,JOHN,Wh . . . what are you talking about?
292029,L633063,u8675,m588,JAKE,I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
292030,L633060,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money."
292031,L633059,u8675,m588,JAKE,That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
292032,L633058,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here."
292033,L633057,u8675,m588,JAKE,That's a thick change of heart.
292034,L633056,u8677,m588,JOHN,"It's the truth, Jake."
292035,L633055,u8675,m588,JAKE,Liar.
292036,L633054,u8677,m588,JOHN,I came to kill her.
292037,L633053,u8675,m588,JAKE,You came to take my wife from me?
292038,L633052,u8677,m588,JOHN,I came for Grace.
292039,L633051,u8675,m588,JAKE,There's another reason?  It better be good.
292040,L633050,u8677,m588,JOHN,That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
292041,L633049,u8675,m588,JAKE,"And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead."
292042,L633048,u8677,m588,JOHN,Jake--
292043,L633047,u8675,m588,JAKE,You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
292044,L633046,u8677,m588,JOHN,Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
292045,L633045,u8675,m588,JAKE,Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
292046,L633044,u8677,m588,JOHN,It's not like that.
292047,L633043,u8675,m588,JAKE,Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
292048,L633042,u8677,m588,JOHN,He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
292049,L633041,u8675,m588,JAKE,Darrell giving you problems?
292050,L633040,u8677,m588,JOHN,You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
292051,L633039,u8675,m588,JAKE,Trouble with the car again?
292052,L633038,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, well, me too."
292053,L632925,u8677,m588,JOHN,No.
292054,L632924,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you."
292055,L632836,u8677,m588,JOHN,"That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man."
292056,L632835,u8675,m588,JAKE,All I have in the world.
292057,L632834,u8677,m588,JOHN,You think that's a lot of money?
292058,L632833,u8675,m588,JAKE,Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
292059,L632832,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?"
292060,L632829,u8677,m588,JOHN,SHUT UP!
292061,L632828,u8675,m588,JAKE,"And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead."
292062,L632827,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Drop it, Jake."
292063,L632826,u8675,m588,JAKE,Came close this time and it scares you.
292064,L632825,u8677,m588,JOHN,Shut up.
292065,L632824,u8675,m588,JAKE,"I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy."
292066,L632823,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You love her, but you hate her?"
292067,L632822,u8675,m588,JAKE,I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
292068,L632821,u8677,m588,JOHN,You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
292069,L632820,u8675,m588,JAKE,"I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?"
292070,L632819,u8677,m588,JOHN,You know what I mean.
292071,L632818,u8675,m588,JAKE,"You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape."
292072,L632817,u8677,m588,JOHN,The time wasn't right.
292073,L632816,u8675,m588,JAKE,You didn't kill her?
292074,L632815,u8677,m588,JOHN,No.
292075,L632814,u8675,m588,JAKE,Is the job done?
292076,L632813,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . ."
292077,L632728,u8677,m588,JOHN,And tell her what?
292078,L632727,u8675,m588,JAKE,This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
292079,L632726,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . ."
292080,L632725,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know."
292081,L632724,u8675,m588,JAKE,How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
292082,L632723,u8677,m588,JOHN,What should I do?
292083,L632722,u8675,m588,JAKE,"The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere."
292084,L632721,u8677,m588,JOHN,I guess I might as well get this done with.
292085,L632720,u8675,m588,JAKE,If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
292086,L632719,u8677,m588,JOHN,Do we shake hands?
292087,L632718,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact."
292088,L632717,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience."
292089,L632716,u8675,m588,JAKE,"You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you."
292090,L632715,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing."
292091,L632714,u8675,m588,JAKE,That's a bit much.
292092,L632713,u8677,m588,JOHN,I need thirteen.
292093,L632712,u8675,m588,JAKE,Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
292094,L632711,u8677,m588,JOHN,How much could you get?
292095,L632710,u8675,m588,JAKE,Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
292096,L632709,u8677,m588,JOHN,Make it twenty.
292097,L632708,u8675,m588,JAKE,"I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?"
292098,L632707,u8677,m588,JOHN,How do you put a price on murder?
292099,L632706,u8675,m588,JAKE,Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
292100,L632705,u8677,m588,JOHN,For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
292101,L632704,u8675,m588,JAKE,And for that you'd kill Grace?
292102,L632703,u8677,m588,JOHN,This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
292103,L632702,u8675,m588,JAKE,Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
292104,L632701,u8677,m588,JOHN,The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
292105,L632700,u8675,m588,JAKE,And what does that make you?
292106,L632699,u8677,m588,JOHN,Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
292107,L632698,u8675,m588,JAKE,What makes you say that?
292108,L632697,u8677,m588,JOHN,You meant it.
292109,L632696,u8675,m588,JAKE,A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
292110,L632695,u8677,m588,JOHN,Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
292111,L632694,u8675,m588,JAKE,That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
292112,L632693,u8677,m588,JOHN,You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
292113,L632692,u8675,m588,JAKE,You're talking like a mad man.
292114,L632691,u8677,m588,JOHN,I'm not rambling.
292115,L632690,u8675,m588,JAKE,I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
292116,L632689,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money."
292117,L632688,u8675,m588,JAKE,I did?
292118,L632687,u8677,m588,JOHN,You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
292119,L632686,u8675,m588,JAKE,I do.
292120,L632685,u8677,m588,JOHN,You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
292121,L632684,u8677,m588,JOHN,About what you said this morning.
292122,L632683,u8675,m588,JAKE,Sweet Grace?  What about her?
292123,L632682,u8677,m588,JOHN,About things.  About your wife.
292124,L632681,u8675,m588,JAKE,Talk?  About what?
292125,L632680,u8677,m588,JOHN,I was hoping we could talk.
292126,L632679,u8675,m588,JAKE,Now what can I do for you?
292127,L632678,u8677,m588,JOHN,Isn't that illegal?
292128,L632677,u8675,m588,JAKE,"I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way."
292129,L632676,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nice office you've got.
292130,L632675,u8675,m588,JAKE,"You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?"
292131,L632674,u8677,m588,JOHN,I had a problem getting my car back.
292132,L632673,u8675,m588,JAKE,I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
292133,L632672,u8677,m588,JOHN,No.
292134,L632671,u8675,m588,JAKE,Hungry?
292135,L632670,u8677,m588,JOHN,No.
292136,L632669,u8675,m588,JAKE,Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
292137,L632668,u8677,m588,JOHN,Just ran into a little trouble.
292138,L632667,u8675,m588,JAKE,Good Lord.  What happened to you?
292139,L632428,u8677,m588,JOHN,"This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?"
292140,L632427,u8675,m588,JAKE,How do you know if you've never tried?
292141,L632426,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna."
292142,L632425,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it."
292143,L632424,u8677,m588,JOHN,Why would I kill her?
292144,L632422,u8675,m588,JAKE,Would you kill her?
292145,L632421,u8677,m588,JOHN,Would I what?
292146,L632420,u8675,m588,JAKE,Would you?
292147,L632418,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you."
292148,L632417,u8677,m588,JOHN,Like you don't know.
292149,L632416,u8675,m588,JAKE,"I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you."
292150,L632415,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em."
292151,L632414,u8675,m588,JAKE,"She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women."
292152,L632413,u8675,m588,JAKE,"That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?"
292153,L632412,u8677,m588,JOHN,Hey!
292154,L632411,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Ah, I can smell it on you."
292155,L632410,u8677,m588,JOHN,Wait a second--
292156,L632409,u8675,m588,JAKE,"It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples."
292157,L632408,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--"
292158,L632407,u8675,m588,JAKE,"You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile."
292159,L632406,u8677,m588,JOHN,Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
292160,L632405,u8675,m588,JAKE,Live there?
292161,L632404,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara."
292162,L632403,u8675,m588,JAKE,Where you headed?
292163,L632402,u8677,m588,JOHN,My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
292164,L632401,u8675,m588,JAKE,What brings you to Sierra?
292165,L632400,u8677,m588,JOHN,John Stewart.
292166,L632399,u8675,m588,JAKE,I'm a solid man.
292167,L632398,u8677,m588,JOHN,Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
292168,L632397,u8675,m588,JAKE,I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
292169,L632396,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, I know.  More careful."
292170,L632395,u8675,m588,JAKE,You've got to be--
292171,L632394,u8677,m588,JOHN,Accident.
292172,L632393,u8675,m588,JAKE,What happened to your hand?
292173,L632389,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way."
292174,L632388,u8675,m588,JAKE,I have half a mind to--
292175,L632385,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Grace, tell him."
292176,L632384,u8675,m588,JAKE,A lot that means.
292177,L632383,u8677,m588,JOHN,I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
292178,L632382,u8675,m588,JAKE,Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
292179,L632381,u8677,m588,JOHN,I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
292180,L632380,u8675,m588,JAKE,"Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half."
292181,L632379,u8677,m588,JOHN,Husband . . .?
292182,L632378,u8675,m588,JAKE,I'm her husband.
292183,L632377,u8677,m588,JOHN,Who the hell are you?
292184,L632956,u8680,m588,TOBY,"You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see."
292185,L632955,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!"
292186,L632868,u8680,m588,TOBY,I said come on!
292187,L632867,u8676,m588,JENNY,I want to stay.
292188,L632620,u8680,m588,TOBY,"Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of."
292189,L632619,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox."
292190,L632615,u8680,m588,TOBY,"You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?"
292191,L632614,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking."
292192,L632613,u8680,m588,TOBY,I asked you a question.
292193,L632958,u8677,m588,JOHN,Get away from me!
292194,L632957,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together."
292195,L632859,u8677,m588,JOHN,Will you shut up!
292196,L632858,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child."
292197,L632855,u8676,m588,JENNY,What's your name anyway?
292198,L632854,u8677,m588,JOHN,What the hell are you talking about?
292199,L632853,u8676,m588,JENNY,"You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind."
292200,L632848,u8677,m588,JOHN,"No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--"
292201,L632847,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want."
292202,L632846,u8677,m588,JOHN,How old are you?
292203,L632845,u8676,m588,JENNY,That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
292204,L632844,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town."
292205,L632843,u8676,m588,JENNY,"He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is."
292206,L632842,u8677,m588,JOHN,I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
292207,L632841,u8676,m588,JENNY,But you was going to fight for me.
292208,L632840,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you."
292209,L632839,u8676,m588,JENNY,For defending my honor this afternoon.
292210,L632838,u8677,m588,JOHN,For what?
292211,L632837,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you."
292212,L632611,u8677,m588,JOHN,You're too quick for me.
292213,L632610,u8676,m588,JENNY,You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
292214,L632609,u8677,m588,JOHN,Oz.
292215,L632608,u8676,m588,JENNY,"You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?"
292216,L632607,u8677,m588,JOHN,I've had time to get over it.
292217,L632606,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?"
292218,L632605,u8677,m588,JOHN,She's dead.
292219,L632604,u8676,m588,JENNY,"You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records."
292220,L632603,u8676,m588,JENNY,How about I pick one out for you?
292221,L632602,u8677,m588,JOHN,That country shit all sounds the same to me.
292222,L632601,u8676,m588,JENNY,Got any requests?
292223,L632600,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful."
292224,L632599,u8676,m588,JENNY,What happened to your hand?
292225,L632598,u8676,m588,JENNY,I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
292226,L632597,u8677,m588,JOHN,What?
292227,L632596,u8676,m588,JENNY,"Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?"
292228,L632965,u8680,m588,TOBY,I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
292229,L632964,u8677,m588,JOHN,Nooo!
292230,L632963,u8680,m588,TOBY,This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
292231,L632962,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!"
292232,L632961,u8680,m588,TOBY,Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
292233,L632960,u8677,m588,JOHN,Give it to me!
292234,L632959,u8680,m588,TOBY,"Now, what's this?"
292235,L632954,u8680,m588,TOBY,"My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?"
292236,L632953,u8677,m588,JOHN,You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
292237,L632952,u8680,m588,TOBY,I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
292238,L632951,u8677,m588,JOHN,What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
292239,L632950,u8680,m588,TOBY,"Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance."
292240,L632857,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this."
292241,L632856,u8680,m588,TOBY,"Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy."
292242,L632852,u8677,m588,JOHN,I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
292243,L632851,u8680,m588,TOBY,"That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back."
292244,L632850,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Oh, shit!"
292245,L632849,u8680,m588,TOBY,Mister!
292246,L632635,u8680,m588,TOBY,"Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit."
292247,L632634,u8677,m588,JOHN,I wasn't hitting on your girl!
292248,L632633,u8680,m588,TOBY,Stand up.
292249,L632632,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Christ, I don't believe this."
292250,L632631,u8680,m588,TOBY,Not before I settle with you.
292251,L632630,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away."
292252,L632629,u8680,m588,TOBY,'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
292253,L632628,u8677,m588,JOHN,They're not very imaginative?
292254,L632627,u8680,m588,TOBY,You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
292255,L632626,u8677,m588,JOHN,You're fucked.
292256,L632625,u8677,m588,JOHN,What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
292257,L632624,u8680,m588,TOBY,"Mister, I'm calling you out."
292258,L632623,u8677,m588,JOHN,I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
292259,L632622,u8680,m588,TOBY,You expect me to believe that?
292260,L632621,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl."
292261,L632618,u8677,m588,JOHN,Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
292262,L632617,u8680,m588,TOBY,That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
292263,L632616,u8677,m588,JOHN,I wasn't doing anything.
292264,L632525,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . ."
292265,L632524,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
292266,L632523,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,"And John, don't make me come look for you."
292267,L632522,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Yes, Mr. Vesci."
292268,L632521,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,Do you understand me you little fuck?
292269,L632520,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,"A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is."
292270,L632519,u8677,m588,JOHN,A hundred-forty-five really.
292271,L632518,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,"Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed."
292272,L632517,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money."
292273,L632516,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,You're the gambler.  You tell me.
292274,L632515,u8677,m588,JOHN,"With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?"
292275,L632514,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,The old lady?
292276,L632513,u8677,m588,JOHN,No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
292277,L632512,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
292278,L632511,u8677,m588,JOHN,"You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed."
292279,L632510,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,"That's a shame, John.  A real shame."
292280,L632509,u8677,m588,JOHN,"I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere."
292281,L632508,u8678,m588,MR. VESCI,"John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone."
292282,L633207,u8677,m588,JOHN,And you're taking?
292283,L633206,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take."
292284,L633199,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . ."
292285,L633198,u8677,m588,JOHN,Thirty-thousand dollars.
292286,L633197,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?"
292287,L633196,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
292288,L633195,u8677,m588,JOHN,That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
292289,L633189,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you."
292290,L633188,u8677,m588,JOHN,I didn't do anything.
292291,L633187,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool."
292292,L633186,u8677,m588,JOHN,You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
292293,L633178,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
292294,L633177,u8677,m588,JOHN,"There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff."
292295,L633176,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,I think you might just want to do as I say.
292296,L633175,u8677,m588,JOHN,What for?
292297,L633174,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
292298,L633173,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Sure, Sheriff."
292299,L633172,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
292300,L633171,u8677,m588,JOHN,I don't understand what the--
292301,L633170,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Why don't you step out of the car, son?"
292302,L633163,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Nope.  No problems up the road.
292303,L633162,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?"
292304,L633161,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've."
292305,L633160,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -"
292306,L633159,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that."
292307,L633158,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town."
292308,L633157,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
292309,L632889,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town."
292310,L632888,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush."
292311,L632887,u8677,m588,JOHN,"Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place."
292312,L632886,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
292313,L632885,u8677,m588,JOHN,Wouldn't know anything about it.
292314,L632884,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
292315,L632883,u8677,m588,JOHN,Not as bad as it looks.
292316,L632882,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
292317,L632881,u8677,m588,JOHN,"No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about."
292318,L632880,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
292319,L632879,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?
292320,L632878,u8677,m588,JOHN,I guess.
292321,L632877,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man."
292322,L632876,u8677,m588,JOHN,Jesus!
292323,L632875,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,"His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery."
292324,L632874,u8677,m588,JOHN,What happened?
292325,L632873,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
292326,L632872,u8677,m588,JOHN,Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
292327,L632871,u8679,m588,SHERIFF,Kids.
292328,L632471,u8677,m588,JOHN,No police!
292329,L632470,u8681,m588,WOMAN,"Senor, you need a doctor."
292330,L632469,u8677,m588,JOHN,No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
292331,L632468,u8681,m588,WOMAN,"But, Senor--"
292332,L632467,u8677,m588,JOHN,No police.
292333,L632466,u8677,m588,JOHN,No!
292334,L632465,u8681,m588,WOMAN,I call the policia.
292335,L632436,u8677,m588,JOHN,Soda.  You know.
292336,L632435,u8681,m588,WOMAN,"Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien."
292337,L632434,u8677,m588,JOHN,Soda.  You got any soda?
292338,L632433,u8681,m588,WOMAN,Eh?
292339,L632432,u8677,m588,JOHN,Got any cold soda?
292340,L634094,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,You know I won't be seeing you.
292341,L634093,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man."
292342,L634092,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
292343,L634091,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
292344,L634087,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you."
292345,L634086,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way."
292346,L634085,u8683,m589,BOBBY,No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
292347,L634084,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
292348,L634083,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Not this twig, friend.  I got plans."
292349,L634082,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,More or less.
292350,L634081,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?"
292351,L634080,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me."
292352,L634079,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You afraid of the dark?
292353,L634078,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of."
292354,L634077,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty."
292355,L634076,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark."
292356,L633906,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well."
292357,L633905,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
292358,L633904,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
292359,L633903,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I got things to do.
292360,L633902,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that ""om""! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, ""the more you eat, the more you want....""..."
292361,L633901,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
292362,L633900,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy."
292363,L633899,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
292364,L633898,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy."
292365,L633897,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Who's cursed?
292366,L633896,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
292367,L633894,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,...And everything is nothing too.
292368,L633893,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What?
292369,L633892,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
292370,L633891,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man."
292371,L633890,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,What do you want for free?
292372,L633889,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I think I've heard that before.
292373,L633888,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be."
292374,L633887,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Maybe I do.
292375,L633885,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That a fact?
292376,L633884,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
292377,L633883,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
292378,L633380,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse."
292379,L633379,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Hell no!
292380,L633378,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
292381,L633377,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
292382,L633376,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?"
292383,L633375,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Oh, Jesus."
292384,L633374,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,That's 'cause he's dead.
292385,L633373,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
292386,L633369,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Christ!
292387,L633368,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
292388,L633366,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"All right, old man.  Christ."
292389,L633365,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
292390,L633364,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, sure.  You got change?"
292391,L633363,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
292392,L633362,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I said I was sorry.
292393,L633361,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
292394,L633360,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Christ no!
292395,L633359,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
292396,L633358,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
292397,L633357,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
292398,L633356,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I'm sorry, I didn't--"
292399,L633355,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?"
292400,L633354,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You can't do that yourself?
292401,L633353,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
292402,L633352,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You want something?
292403,L633351,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,"Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?"
292404,L633350,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You want something, old man?"
292405,L633349,u8682,m589,BLIND MAN,Hey!  You there!
292406,L634037,u8693,m589,TOBY,This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
292407,L634036,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!"
292408,L634035,u8693,m589,TOBY,Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
292409,L634034,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Give it to me!
292410,L634033,u8693,m589,TOBY,"Now, what's this?"
292411,L634028,u8693,m589,TOBY,"My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?"
292412,L634027,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
292413,L634026,u8693,m589,TOBY,I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
292414,L633927,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this."
292415,L633926,u8693,m589,TOBY,"Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy."
292416,L633922,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
292417,L633921,u8693,m589,TOBY,"That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back."
292418,L633920,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Oh, shit!"
292419,L633919,u8693,m589,TOBY,Mister!
292420,L633686,u8693,m589,TOBY,"Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit."
292421,L633685,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I wasn't hitting on your girl!
292422,L633684,u8693,m589,TOBY,Stand up.
292423,L633683,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Christ, I don't believe this!"
292424,L633682,u8693,m589,TOBY,"Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!"
292425,L633681,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
292426,L633680,u8693,m589,TOBY,"'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt."
292427,L633679,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
292428,L633677,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
292429,L633676,u8693,m589,TOBY,"Mister, I'm calling you out."
292430,L633675,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
292431,L633674,u8693,m589,TOBY,You expect me to believe that?
292432,L633673,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl."
292433,L633670,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
292434,L633669,u8693,m589,TOBY,That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
292435,L633668,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I wasn't doing anything.
292436,L634146,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
292437,L634145,u8688,m589,JAKE,Two-hundred dollars?
292438,L634144,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with."
292439,L634143,u8688,m589,JAKE,You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
292440,L634137,u8688,m589,JAKE,Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
292441,L634136,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Come on, Jake --"
292442,L634135,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What are you talking about!
292443,L634134,u8688,m589,JAKE,How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
292444,L634128,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money."
292445,L634127,u8688,m589,JAKE,"You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk."
292446,L634126,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother."
292447,L634125,u8688,m589,JAKE,That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
292448,L634124,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"It's the truth, Jake."
292449,L634123,u8688,m589,JAKE,Shhh! Liar.
292450,L634122,u8688,m589,JAKE,You came to take my wife from me?
292451,L634121,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I came for Grace.
292452,L634119,u8688,m589,JAKE,"...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000..."
292453,L634118,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
292454,L634117,u8688,m589,JAKE,"No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!"
292455,L634116,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"It's not what you think, Jake."
292456,L634115,u8688,m589,JAKE,"I guess this is what they call ""ironee""? Hunh?"
292457,L634114,u8688,m589,JAKE,"I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out."
292458,L634113,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
292459,L633881,u8683,m589,BOBBY,No!
292460,L633880,u8688,m589,JAKE,Next time you'll do just fine.
292461,L633801,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all."
292462,L633800,u8688,m589,JAKE,"...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride."
292463,L633799,u8683,m589,BOBBY,And tell her what?
292464,L633798,u8688,m589,JAKE,Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
292465,L633797,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?"
292466,L633796,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be..."
292467,L633795,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know."
292468,L633794,u8688,m589,JAKE,"How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional."
292469,L633793,u8683,m589,BOBBY,How do you want it?
292470,L633792,u8688,m589,JAKE,"If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere."
292471,L633791,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract."
292472,L633790,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
292473,L633789,u8688,m589,JAKE,"You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you."
292474,L633788,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing."
292475,L633787,u8688,m589,JAKE,That's a bit much.
292476,L633786,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I need thirteen.
292477,L633785,u8688,m589,JAKE,Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
292478,L633784,u8683,m589,BOBBY,How much could you get?
292479,L633782,u8688,m589,JAKE,"No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little ""games"" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?"
292480,L633781,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You love her, but you hate her?"
292481,L633780,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace."
292482,L633779,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind."
292483,L633778,u8688,m589,JAKE,And what does that make you?
292484,L633777,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
292485,L633776,u8688,m589,JAKE,What makes you say that?
292486,L633775,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You meant it.
292487,L633774,u8688,m589,JAKE,A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
292488,L633773,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
292489,L633772,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead."
292490,L633771,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car."
292491,L633770,u8688,m589,JAKE,You're talking like a madman.
292492,L633769,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm not rambling.
292493,L633768,u8688,m589,JAKE,Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
292494,L633767,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money."
292495,L633766,u8688,m589,JAKE,I did?
292496,L633765,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
292497,L633764,u8688,m589,JAKE,I do.
292498,L633763,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
292499,L633762,u8683,m589,BOBBY,About what you said this morning.
292500,L633761,u8688,m589,JAKE,Sweet Grace?  What about her?
292501,L633760,u8683,m589,BOBBY,About things.  About your wife.
292502,L633759,u8688,m589,JAKE,Talk?  About what?
292503,L633758,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I was hoping we could talk.
292504,L633757,u8688,m589,JAKE,"What can I do for you, lad?"
292505,L633562,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?"
292506,L633561,u8688,m589,JAKE,How do you know if you've never tried?
292507,L633560,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna."
292508,L633558,u8688,m589,JAKE,Would you kill her?
292509,L633557,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Would I what?
292510,L633556,u8688,m589,JAKE,Would you?
292511,L633554,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you."
292512,L633553,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Like you don't know.
292513,L633552,u8688,m589,JAKE,"""You can't shoot 'em!"" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you."
292514,L633551,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em."
292515,L633550,u8688,m589,JAKE,"She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women."
292516,L633549,u8688,m589,JAKE,"That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?"
292517,L633548,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Hey!
292518,L633547,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Ah, I can smell it on you."
292519,L633546,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Wait a second--
292520,L633545,u8688,m589,JAKE,"It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples."
292521,L633544,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--"
292522,L633543,u8688,m589,JAKE,"You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile."
292523,L633542,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
292524,L633541,u8688,m589,JAKE,Live there?
292525,L633540,u8683,m589,BOBBY,California...
292526,L633539,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Darrell's a moron.
292527,L633538,u8688,m589,JAKE,Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
292528,L633537,u8683,m589,BOBBY,An overheated car.
292529,L633536,u8688,m589,JAKE,"""Bobby Cooper."" What brings you to Superior, Coop?"
292530,L633535,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Bobby Cooper.
292531,L633534,u8688,m589,JAKE,I'm a solid man.
292532,L633533,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That's a solid name.
292533,L633532,u8688,m589,JAKE,I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
292534,L633531,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, I know.  More careful."
292535,L633530,u8688,m589,JAKE,You've got to be--
292536,L633529,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Accident.
292537,L633528,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Say, what happened to your hand?"
292538,L633527,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Yeah...
292539,L633526,u8688,m589,JAKE,"After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women."
292540,L633524,u8688,m589,JAKE,"I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know."
292541,L633523,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What the fuck do you want?
292542,L633519,u8688,m589,JAKE,It ain't broke.
292543,L633518,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You broke my nose!
292544,L633517,u8688,m589,JAKE,"You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!"
292545,L633513,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Grace, tell him."
292546,L633512,u8688,m589,JAKE,A lot that means.
292547,L633511,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
292548,L633510,u8688,m589,JAKE,Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
292549,L633509,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all."
292550,L633508,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half."
292551,L633507,u8688,m589,JAKE,I'm her husband.
292552,L633506,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Who the hell are you?
292553,L633505,u8688,m589,JAKE,Who the hell is this!?
292554,L634032,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Get away from me!
292555,L634031,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together."
292556,L633929,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Will you shut up!
292557,L633928,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child."
292558,L633925,u8689,m589,JENNY,What's your name anyway?
292559,L633924,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What the hell are you talking about?
292560,L633923,u8689,m589,JENNY,"You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind."
292561,L633918,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?"
292562,L633917,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want."
292563,L633916,u8683,m589,BOBBY,How old are you?
292564,L633915,u8689,m589,JENNY,That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
292565,L633914,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town."
292566,L633913,u8689,m589,JENNY,"He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is."
292567,L633912,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
292568,L633911,u8689,m589,JENNY,But you was going to fight for me.
292569,L633910,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you."
292570,L633909,u8689,m589,JENNY,For defending my honor this afternoon.
292571,L633908,u8683,m589,BOBBY,For what?
292572,L633907,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you."
292573,L633663,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You're too quick for me.
292574,L633662,u8689,m589,JENNY,You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
292575,L633661,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Oz.
292576,L633660,u8689,m589,JENNY,"You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?"
292577,L633659,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I've had time to get over it.
292578,L633658,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?"
292579,L633657,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Cause she's dead.
292580,L633656,u8689,m589,JENNY,"You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records."
292581,L633655,u8689,m589,JENNY,How about I pick one out for you?
292582,L633654,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That country shit all sounds the same to me.
292583,L633653,u8689,m589,JENNY,Got any requests?
292584,L633652,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful."
292585,L633651,u8689,m589,JENNY,What happened to your hand?
292586,L633650,u8689,m589,JENNY,I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
292587,L633649,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What?
292588,L633648,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?"
292589,L634178,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
292590,L634177,u8685,m589,DARRELL,No.
292591,L634176,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?"
292592,L634175,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?"
292593,L634174,u8685,m589,DARRELL,I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
292594,L634173,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
292595,L634172,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
292596,L634171,u8685,m589,DARRELL,You got the money?
292597,L634170,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I want my car.
292598,L634169,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?"
292599,L634168,u8685,m589,DARRELL,We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
292600,L634167,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Open up!
292601,L634166,u8685,m589,DARRELL,What you want?
292602,L633992,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"When I work on a car, I work on a car."
292603,L633991,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?"
292604,L633990,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key."
292605,L633989,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
292606,L633988,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
292607,L633987,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Darrell.
292608,L633986,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Look, Harlin."
292609,L633983,u8685,m589,DARRELL,What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
292610,L633982,u8683,m589,BOBBY,No! Okay! Okay!
292611,L633980,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>."
292612,L633979,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car."
292613,L633978,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
292614,L633977,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick."
292615,L633976,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation."
292616,L633975,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What sign?
292617,L633974,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign."
292618,L633973,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
292619,L633972,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Yeah, but it was shot."
292620,L633971,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
292621,L633970,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
292622,L633969,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
292623,L633968,u8685,m589,DARRELL,It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
292624,L633967,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What?
292625,L633966,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Two-hundred.
292626,L633965,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--"
292627,L633964,u8685,m589,DARRELL,No charge.
292628,L633963,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"That's a good piece of advice, Darrell."
292629,L633962,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"You think bad, and bad is what you get."
292630,L633961,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You believe that?
292631,L633960,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out."
292632,L633959,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You've been there?
292633,L633958,u8685,m589,DARRELL,One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
292634,L633957,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit."
292635,L633956,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
292636,L633632,u8685,m589,DARRELL,I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
292637,L633631,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
292638,L633630,u8685,m589,DARRELL,You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
292639,L633629,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
292640,L633628,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this ."
292641,L633625,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
292642,L633624,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I don't have a goddamn credit card.
292643,L633623,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split."
292644,L633621,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had."
292645,L633620,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Then you ain't gonna have the car.
292646,L633619,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money."
292647,L633618,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"I don't know, but ""it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.""  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars."
292648,L633617,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
292649,L633616,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"""That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."""
292650,L633615,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?"
292651,L633614,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?"
292652,L633613,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone."
292653,L633612,u8685,m589,DARRELL,A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
292654,L633611,u8683,m589,BOBBY,To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
292655,L633610,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Hundred-fifty.
292656,L633609,u8683,m589,BOBBY,How much!?
292657,L633608,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks."
292658,L633607,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
292659,L633606,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What the hell happened to my car?
292660,L633605,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
292661,L633604,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
292662,L633603,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Don't look like nothing.
292663,L633602,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Nothing.
292664,L633601,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?"
292665,L633600,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Hey.
292666,L633345,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?"
292667,L633344,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it."
292668,L633343,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
292669,L633342,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower."
292670,L633341,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Accident.
292671,L633339,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
292672,L633338,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
292673,L633337,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Twenty-after-ten.
292674,L633336,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Time.
292675,L633335,u8683,m589,BOBBY,How much time?
292676,L633334,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time."
292677,L633333,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Great!
292678,L633332,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Yeah, I can fix it."
292679,L633331,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?"
292680,L633330,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut..."
292681,L633329,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?"
292682,L633328,u8685,m589,DARRELL,"Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?"
292683,L633327,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
292684,L633326,u8685,m589,DARRELL,It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
292685,L633325,u8683,m589,BOBBY,So?
292686,L633324,u8683,m589,BOBBY,OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
292687,L633323,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Darrell--
292688,L633322,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Look, Harlin, I've got places to be."
292689,L633321,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
292690,L633320,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
292691,L633319,u8685,m589,DARRELL,So?
292692,L633318,u8683,m589,BOBBY,But he's dead.
292693,L633317,u8685,m589,DARRELL,'Cause Harlin used to own it.
292694,L633316,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Then why do you call it Harlin's?
292695,L633315,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Yep.
292696,L633314,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You own this place?
292697,L633313,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
292698,L633312,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Will he be back soon?
292699,L633311,u8685,m589,DARRELL,He's up at the Look Out.
292700,L633310,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Harlin around?
292701,L633309,u8685,m589,DARRELL,Nope.  Darrell.
292702,L633308,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You Harlin?
292703,L633597,u8683,m589,BOBBY,No! No police.
292704,L633596,u8694,m589,WOMAN,I call the sheriff.
292705,L633570,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Soda.  You know.
292706,L633569,u8694,m589,WOMAN,"Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien."
292707,L633568,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Soda.  You got any soda?
292708,L633567,u8694,m589,WOMAN,Eh?
292709,L633566,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Got any cold soda?
292710,L634299,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!"
292711,L634298,u8687,m589,GRACE,<u>Jake</u>...
292712,L634295,u8683,m589,BOBBY,And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
292713,L634294,u8687,m589,GRACE,And I love you too.
292714,L634293,u8683,m589,BOBBY,'Cause I love you.
292715,L634292,u8687,m589,GRACE,Why's that?
292716,L634287,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down."
292717,L634286,u8687,m589,GRACE,Can you make it back up?
292718,L634285,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I busted my leg!
292719,L634284,u8687,m589,GRACE,Bobby? Are you all right?
292720,L634283,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace."
292721,L634277,u8683,m589,BOBBY,But we all need that too. Hold him.
292722,L634276,u8687,m589,GRACE,Hope is a four-letter word.
292723,L634274,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three..."
292724,L634273,u8687,m589,GRACE,My mother died in this canyon.
292725,L634272,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Time to go for a walk, Jake."
292726,L634268,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared..."
292727,L634267,u8687,m589,GRACE,"I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?"
292728,L634266,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen."
292729,L634265,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?"
292730,L634264,u8687,m589,GRACE,"I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!"
292731,L634263,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
292732,L634262,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby."
292733,L634261,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own."
292734,L634258,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds."
292735,L634257,u8687,m589,GRACE,"You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?"
292736,L634256,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
292737,L634254,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You could give me my gun back.
292738,L634253,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?"
292739,L634252,u8687,m589,GRACE,"You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!"
292740,L634251,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"No Grace, my hand's bothering me."
292741,L634244,u8687,m589,GRACE,<u>I don't know why</u>!
292742,L634243,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Why?
292743,L634241,u8687,m589,GRACE,Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
292744,L634240,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past..."
292745,L634239,u8687,m589,GRACE,Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
292746,L634238,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
292747,L634237,u8687,m589,GRACE,"So, aren't you going to ask me?"
292748,L634236,u8687,m589,GRACE,"He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same."
292749,L634235,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop..."
292750,L634234,u8687,m589,GRACE,The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
292751,L634233,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ..."
292752,L634232,u8687,m589,GRACE,Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
292753,L634206,u8687,m589,GRACE,What are you talking about?
292754,L634205,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You know I thought you'd left me back there.
292755,L634204,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You already have.
292756,L634203,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there."
292757,L634202,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
292758,L634201,u8687,m589,GRACE,Anywhere?
292759,L634200,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go."
292760,L634199,u8687,m589,GRACE,But I thought --
292761,L634198,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm not sailing his boat.
292762,L634197,u8687,m589,GRACE,Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
292763,L634196,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace."
292764,L634195,u8687,m589,GRACE,Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
292765,L634194,u8683,m589,BOBBY,We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
292766,L634193,u8687,m589,GRACE,You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
292767,L634192,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I don't know about that?
292768,L634191,u8687,m589,GRACE,You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
292769,L634190,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
292770,L634188,u8687,m589,GRACE,It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
292771,L634187,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I can't see it.
292772,L634185,u8687,m589,GRACE,I'm not coming back.
292773,L634184,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Good thinking.  What's all this?
292774,L634183,u8687,m589,GRACE,I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
292775,L634182,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
292776,L634181,u8687,m589,GRACE,Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
292777,L634161,u8683,m589,BOBBY,No! You get it!
292778,L634160,u8687,m589,GRACE,The money's right here! Get the key!
292779,L634061,u8687,m589,GRACE,After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
292780,L634060,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Grace ... Grace?
292781,L634059,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird."
292782,L634058,u8687,m589,GRACE,You said you couldn't kill anybody.
292783,L634057,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out."
292784,L634056,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?"
292785,L634055,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that."
292786,L634054,u8687,m589,GRACE,Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
292787,L634053,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I could if I had Jake's money.
292788,L634052,u8687,m589,GRACE,I thought you couldn't get your car.
292789,L634051,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me."
292790,L634050,u8687,m589,GRACE,Because I know you're full of shit.
292791,L634049,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?"
292792,L634048,u8687,m589,GRACE,Stop it.
292793,L634047,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace."
292794,L634046,u8687,m589,GRACE,"There is no us, remember?"
292795,L634045,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What about us?
292796,L634044,u8687,m589,GRACE,I don't think we have anything to talk about.
292797,L634043,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I wanted to talk.
292798,L633871,u8687,m589,GRACE,"It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and..."
292799,L633870,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody."
292800,L633869,u8687,m589,GRACE,Kill him.
292801,L633868,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"If the key's on him, how do we get the key?"
292802,L633867,u8687,m589,GRACE,It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
292803,L633866,u8683,m589,BOBBY,One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
292804,L633865,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least..."
292805,L633864,u8683,m589,BOBBY,In <u>cash</u>?
292806,L633863,u8687,m589,GRACE,At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
292807,L633862,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What do you mean?
292808,L633861,u8687,m589,GRACE,Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
292809,L633860,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Where?
292810,L633858,u8683,m589,BOBBY,...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
292811,L633857,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere..."
292812,L633856,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You don't have any money put away, do you?"
292813,L633855,u8687,m589,GRACE,Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
292814,L633854,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic..."
292815,L633853,u8687,m589,GRACE,Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
292816,L633852,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see."
292817,L633851,u8687,m589,GRACE,Is it pretty?
292818,L633850,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world."
292819,L633849,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Yeah.
292820,L633848,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?"
292821,L633847,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm sorry...
292822,L633846,u8687,m589,GRACE,"After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her..."
292823,L633845,u8687,m589,GRACE,"You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away."
292824,L633844,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Yeah.
292825,L633843,u8687,m589,GRACE,"He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his ""little halfbreed""... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?"
292826,L633842,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You mean the Shaman?
292827,L633841,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Nothing I understand better than a mess.
292828,L633840,u8687,m589,GRACE,It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
292829,L633839,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Try me.
292830,L633838,u8687,m589,GRACE,You'd never understand.
292831,L633837,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold."
292832,L633836,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can."
292833,L633835,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Don't feel like nothing.
292834,L633834,u8687,m589,GRACE,Nothing.
292835,L633833,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What's the matter?...Grace?
292836,L633827,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out."
292837,L633826,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
292838,L633825,u8687,m589,GRACE,It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
292839,L633824,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Walk away.
292840,L633823,u8687,m589,GRACE,I don't know how.
292841,L633822,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You could leave him.
292842,L633821,u8687,m589,GRACE,All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
292843,L633820,u8687,m589,GRACE,"I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?"
292844,L633819,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
292845,L633818,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
292846,L633817,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm guessing no.
292847,L633816,u8687,m589,GRACE,"I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?"
292848,L633815,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Is that why you're with him?
292849,L633814,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me."
292850,L633813,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Did you ever?
292851,L633812,u8687,m589,GRACE,No.
292852,L633811,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You love him?
292853,L633810,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way."
292854,L633809,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Doesn't the isolation bother you?
292855,L633808,u8687,m589,GRACE,They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
292856,L633807,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Are there snakes out here?
292857,L633804,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
292858,L633803,u8687,m589,GRACE,How do you know he's still not here?
292859,L633802,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk..."
292860,L633503,u8687,m589,GRACE,Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
292861,L633502,u8683,m589,BOBBY,You know what I want.
292862,L633501,u8687,m589,GRACE,That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
292863,L633500,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Still playing?
292864,L633499,u8687,m589,GRACE,You never did answer my question.
292865,L633498,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade."
292866,L633497,u8687,m589,GRACE,Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
292867,L633496,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I think I can find my own way back to into town.
292868,L633495,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?"
292869,L633494,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around."
292870,L633492,u8687,m589,GRACE,And what would that be?
292871,L633491,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I have an idea.
292872,L633490,u8687,m589,GRACE,No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
292873,L633489,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Nothing like a little liveliness.
292874,L633488,u8687,m589,GRACE,I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.

292884,L633474,u8687,m589,GRACE,Come here.
292885,L633473,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
292886,L633472,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Those are white words, not ours."
292887,L633471,u8683,m589,BOBBY,A medicine man?
292888,L633470,u8687,m589,GRACE,From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
292889,L633469,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Where'd you learn to do that?
292890,L633468,u8687,m589,GRACE,"A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes."
292891,L633467,u8683,m589,BOBBY,What do you do anyway?
292892,L633466,u8687,m589,GRACE,I guess it must.
292893,L633465,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
292894,L633462,u8687,m589,GRACE,Thank you.
292895,L633461,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Nice place.
292896,L633460,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Good, 'cause I liked what I saw."
292897,L633459,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
292898,L633458,u8687,m589,GRACE,Did you like it; me watching you?
292899,L633457,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I didn't say it bothered me.
292900,L633456,u8687,m589,GRACE,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
292901,L633455,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
292902,L633446,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I pack up and go somewhere else.
292903,L633445,u8687,m589,GRACE,What happens when you lose?
292904,L633444,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes."
292905,L633443,u8687,m589,GRACE,"I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances."
292906,L633442,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... ."
292907,L633441,u8687,m589,GRACE,"So, what is it you do, Mister...?"
292908,L633440,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
292909,L633439,u8687,m589,GRACE,Where you headed?
292910,L633438,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I guess I've got wander in my blood.
292911,L633437,u8687,m589,GRACE,You've been around.
292912,L633436,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas."
292913,L633435,u8687,m589,GRACE,Where you coming from?
292914,L633422,u8687,m589,GRACE,And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
292915,L633421,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
292916,L633420,u8687,m589,GRACE,"You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?"
292917,L633419,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
292918,L633418,u8687,m589,GRACE,Drove into Superior?  What for?
292919,L633417,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I just drove in this morning.
292920,L633416,u8687,m589,GRACE,You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
292921,L633415,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
292922,L633414,u8687,m589,GRACE,"You're not from around here, are you?"
292923,L633413,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"You're welcome, Grace."
292924,L633412,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Thank you, Bobby."
292925,L633407,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That's all right.  I got it.
292926,L633406,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up."
292927,L633405,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Wasn't nothing.
292928,L633404,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"No trouble at all, really."
292929,L633403,u8687,m589,GRACE,"It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot."
292930,L633402,u8687,m589,GRACE,You should be more careful.
292931,L633401,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Accident.
292932,L633400,u8687,m589,GRACE,What happened to your hand?
292933,L633399,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"No, I've got it."
292934,L633397,u8687,m589,GRACE,Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
292935,L633396,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I got it.
292936,L633395,u8687,m589,GRACE,You sure you can manage?
292937,L633394,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Jesus.
292938,L633393,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"May I carry your package, Grace?"
292939,L633392,u8687,m589,GRACE,It's Grace.
292940,L633391,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"I like that about me, beautiful."
292941,L633390,u8687,m589,GRACE,"You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?"
292942,L633389,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking."
292943,L633388,u8687,m589,GRACE,Maybe I don't want you to.
292944,L633387,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I don't know your real name.
292945,L633386,u8687,m589,GRACE,Do you have to call me that?
292946,L633385,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?"
292947,L633384,u8687,m589,GRACE,My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
292948,L633383,u8683,m589,BOBBY,That's right on my way.
292949,L633382,u8687,m589,GRACE,I'm just going to my car?
292950,L633381,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Can I give you a hand, beautiful?"
292951,L633948,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road."
292952,L633947,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
292953,L633946,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks."
292954,L633945,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,That's a nasty cut you got there.
292955,L633944,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about."
292956,L633943,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
292957,L633942,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,Get in.

292959,L633940,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,Where ya goin'?
292960,L633429,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
292961,L633428,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Morning, officer."
292962,L633743,u8683,m589,BOBBY,Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
292963,L633742,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,What'd you say to me!
292964,L633740,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,"A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is."
292965,L633739,u8683,m589,BOBBY,A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
292966,L633738,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,"...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed."
292967,L633737,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Yeah, if you could send it care of..."
292968,L633736,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh..."
292969,L633735,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,Which you don't have.
292970,L633734,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money."
292971,L633733,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?"
292972,L633732,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,The old lady?
292973,L633731,u8683,m589,BOBBY,No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
292974,L633730,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
292975,L633729,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!"
292976,L633728,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,"""Arkady"""
292977,L633727,u8683,m589,BOBBY,"And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin..."
292978,L633726,u8690,m589,MR. ARKADY,"That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame."
292979,L634012,u8683,m589,BOBBY,I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
292980,L634011,u8684,m589,CLERK,"Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight."

293028,L633423,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,Morning Grace.
293029,L634158,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Like you helped her, Jake?"
293030,L634157,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Help me, Grace, help..."
293031,L634111,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things..."
293032,L634110,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff."
293033,L634108,u8688,m589,JAKE,There's someone in the house.
293034,L634107,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass."
293035,L634106,u8688,m589,JAKE,You didn't hear something?
293036,L634105,u8687,m589,GRACE,What's the matter?
293037,L634102,u8687,m589,GRACE,No! No! Please!
293038,L634101,u8688,m589,JAKE,"You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone."
293039,L634100,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!"
293040,L634099,u8688,m589,JAKE,"You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!"
293041,L634098,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please."
293042,L634097,u8688,m589,JAKE,"Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best."
293043,L634073,u8687,m589,GRACE,"Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing."
293044,L634072,u8688,m589,JAKE,"What the hell you looking at, girl?"
293045,L634071,u8687,m589,GRACE,"I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors."
293046,L634070,u8688,m589,JAKE,They look nice.
293047,L634069,u8687,m589,GRACE,You haven't even looked at them once.
293048,L634068,u8688,m589,JAKE,They look nice.
293049,L634067,u8687,m589,GRACE,You never said anything.  About the drapes.
293050,L634066,u8688,m589,JAKE,I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
293051,L634065,u8687,m589,GRACE,"I put up new drapes, Jake."
293052,L634064,u8688,m589,JAKE,"You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?"
293053,L634063,u8687,m589,GRACE,Wrong number.
293054,L634062,u8688,m589,JAKE,Who was that on the phone?
293055,L634030,u8693,m589,TOBY,"You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see."
293056,L634029,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!"
293057,L633937,u8693,m589,TOBY,I said come on!
293058,L633936,u8689,m589,JENNY,I want to stay.
293059,L633672,u8693,m589,TOBY,"Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ..."
293060,L633671,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox."
293061,L633667,u8693,m589,TOBY,"You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?"
293062,L633666,u8689,m589,JENNY,"Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking."
293063,L633665,u8693,m589,TOBY,I axed you a question.
293064,L634023,u8691,m589,SERGEI,I want my lawyer!
293065,L634022,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,"Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can."
293066,L634021,u8691,m589,SERGEI,"What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police..."
293067,L634020,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,"What's that?  ...""concealed"" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?"
293068,L634019,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,"What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything..."
293069,L634018,u8691,m589,SERGEI,"I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?"
293070,L634017,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,"Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?"
293071,L634016,u8691,m589,SERGEI,Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
293072,L634015,u8692,m589,SHERIFF,"Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state."
293073,L634416,u8697,m590,DAVID,Yes.
293074,L634415,u8695,m590,ANCIENT SECRETARY,Is that the entire message?
293075,L634414,u8697,m590,DAVID,Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
293076,L634413,u8695,m590,ANCIENT SECRETARY,Proceed.
293077,L634411,u8695,m590,ANCIENT SECRETARY,I had to put him down.
293078,L634410,u8697,m590,DAVID,Wow.
293079,L634409,u8695,m590,ANCIENT SECRETARY,I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
293080,L634408,u8697,m590,DAVID,Oh.
293081,L634407,u8695,m590,ANCIENT SECRETARY,No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
293082,L634406,u8697,m590,DAVID,Is Noel in?
293083,L634405,u8695,m590,ANCIENT SECRETARY,Yes?
293084,L634487,u8696,m590,BUSINESS MAN,I have a lock on the door.
293085,L634486,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,What about Jeb?
293086,L634485,u8696,m590,BUSINESS MAN,I'll keep it in my office room.
293087,L634484,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,I'm listening.
293088,L634480,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time..."
293089,L634479,u8696,m590,BUSINESS MAN,What did I say?
293090,L634478,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"No, no, no, no no... You need to go now."
293091,L634477,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,No.
293092,L634476,u8696,m590,BUSINESS MAN,Four.
293093,L634475,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,How old is Jeb?
293094,L634474,u8696,m590,BUSINESS MAN,My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
293095,L634473,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Once again please?
293096,L634471,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,You've made a considerably wise decision.
293097,L634470,u8696,m590,BUSINESS MAN,Wrap it up.
293098,L634858,u8702,m590,MEGAN,It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
293099,L634857,u8697,m590,DAVID,I don't know Megan.
293100,L634856,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Why?
293101,L634853,u8702,m590,MEGAN,That counts.
293102,L634852,u8697,m590,DAVID,I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
293103,L634851,u8702,m590,MEGAN,"Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--"
293104,L634850,u8702,m590,MEGAN,It's finished. I won.
293105,L634849,u8697,m590,DAVID,What about the game?
293106,L634848,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Think carefully?
293107,L634847,u8697,m590,DAVID,I'm not sure.
293108,L634844,u8702,m590,MEGAN,My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
293109,L634843,u8697,m590,DAVID,Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
293110,L634842,u8702,m590,MEGAN,We're supposed to be honest.
293111,L634841,u8697,m590,DAVID,What was that?
293112,L634840,u8702,m590,MEGAN,"Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince."
293113,L634839,u8697,m590,DAVID,My turn. What's your favorite song?
293114,L634838,u8702,m590,MEGAN,I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
293115,L634837,u8697,m590,DAVID,"As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?"
293116,L634836,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Rust?
293117,L634835,u8697,m590,DAVID,...I think rust.
293118,L634780,u8697,m590,DAVID,Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
293119,L634779,u8702,m590,MEGAN,He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
293120,L634778,u8697,m590,DAVID,Jesus.
293121,L634777,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
293122,L634775,u8697,m590,DAVID,out again?
293123,L634774,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Yes.
293124,L634773,u8697,m590,DAVID,Would you like to try going--
293125,L634771,u8697,m590,DAVID,He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
293126,L634770,u8702,m590,MEGAN,He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
293127,L634669,u8702,m590,MEGAN,You use your sleeve.
293128,L634668,u8697,m590,DAVID,What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
293129,L634664,u8702,m590,MEGAN,"Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear."
293130,L634663,u8697,m590,DAVID,"...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?"
293131,L634660,u8702,m590,MEGAN,"I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together."
293132,L634659,u8697,m590,DAVID,I remember you.
293133,L634658,u8702,m590,MEGAN,My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
293134,L634657,u8697,m590,DAVID,Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
293135,L634656,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Yes. Is this David?
293136,L634655,u8697,m590,DAVID,Megan?
293137,L634538,u8697,m590,DAVID,Oh.
293138,L634537,u8702,m590,MEGAN,I've come to a decision.
293139,L634449,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
293140,L634448,u8697,m590,DAVID,Oh shit...
293141,L634447,u8702,m590,MEGAN,The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
293142,L634446,u8697,m590,DAVID,When was the last time I wore pink?
293143,L634443,u8697,m590,DAVID,No that's it.
293144,L634442,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
293145,L634441,u8697,m590,DAVID,Yes.
293146,L634440,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Is that what you wanted to ask me?
293147,L634439,u8702,m590,MEGAN,It means we're probably to tired to remember.
293148,L634438,u8697,m590,DAVID,That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
293149,L634437,u8702,m590,MEGAN,...I can't remember.
293150,L634435,u8697,m590,DAVID,"Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?"
293151,L634434,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Not a specific day. What's this about?
293152,L634433,u8697,m590,DAVID,Do you remember me getting sick?
293153,L634432,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Okay.
293154,L634431,u8697,m590,DAVID,I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
293155,L634430,u8702,m590,MEGAN,I don't know. It's been a while.
293156,L634427,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Oh.
293157,L634426,u8697,m590,DAVID,He's asleep.
293158,L634425,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Is Jeremy okay?
293159,L634372,u8697,m590,DAVID,I know.
293160,L634371,u8702,m590,MEGAN,I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
293161,L634370,u8697,m590,DAVID,I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
293162,L634369,u8702,m590,MEGAN,What does that mean?
293163,L634368,u8697,m590,DAVID,I don't think I got the job in New York.
293164,L634819,u8697,m590,DAVID,No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
293165,L634818,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Are you finished?
293166,L634817,u8697,m590,DAVID,"You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it."
293167,L634816,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
293168,L634815,u8697,m590,DAVID,Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
293169,L634814,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,That's not what I witnessed David.
293170,L634813,u8697,m590,DAVID,I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
293171,L634593,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
293172,L634592,u8697,m590,DAVID,Quick.
293173,L634591,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,One last question.
293174,L634590,u8697,m590,DAVID,I have to go now.
293175,L634589,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
293176,L634588,u8697,m590,DAVID,The guy might not have been carrying anything.
293177,L634587,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
293178,L634586,u8697,m590,DAVID,"Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore."
293179,L634585,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort."
293180,L634584,u8697,m590,DAVID,Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
293181,L634583,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,You're skill.
293182,L634582,u8697,m590,DAVID,I don't know what you're asking?
293183,L634581,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Have you ever tried to develop it?
293184,L634580,u8697,m590,DAVID,Yes.
293185,L634579,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Telling when people have done something wrong?
293186,L634578,u8697,m590,DAVID,Like what?
293187,L634577,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
293188,L634576,u8697,m590,DAVID,I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
293189,L634575,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,But not a knife?
293190,L634574,u8697,m590,DAVID,I thought he was carrying something.
293191,L634573,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,You thought he was carrying a knife?
293192,L634572,u8697,m590,DAVID,Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
293193,L634571,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
293194,L634570,u8697,m590,DAVID,"I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on."
293195,L634568,u8697,m590,DAVID,"That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line."
293196,L634567,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Is there a problem?
293197,L634566,u8697,m590,DAVID,Just give me a minute.
293198,L634559,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number."
293199,L634558,u8697,m590,DAVID,Are you for real?
293200,L634557,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?"
293201,L634555,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,We've already begun.
293202,L634554,u8697,m590,DAVID,We're not proceeding anywhere together.
293203,L634553,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
293204,L634552,u8697,m590,DAVID,What do you want?
293205,L634551,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
293206,L634550,u8697,m590,DAVID,It's for last week's game.
293207,L634529,u8697,m590,DAVID,"I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'"
293208,L634528,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,You've misunderstood.
293209,L634527,u8697,m590,DAVID,What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
293210,L634526,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
293211,L634525,u8697,m590,DAVID,At the church... You were following me weren't you?
293212,L634519,u8697,m590,DAVID,What was your idea Elijah?
293213,L634518,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality."
293214,L634516,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
293215,L634515,u8697,m590,DAVID,"You forgot the ""Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on"" step. See usually that comes before the, ""It's over"" Step. And it always, always comes before the ""You can go"" Step.  What is over?"
293216,L634512,u8697,m590,DAVID,You assumed wrong.
293217,L634511,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,I assumed because of the train.
293218,L634509,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Was it serious?
293219,L634508,u8697,m590,DAVID,In college. A car accident.
293220,L634507,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,What's he talking about?
293221,L634505,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level."
293222,L634504,u8697,m590,DAVID,Skeptical about what?
293223,L634503,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
293224,L634502,u8697,m590,DAVID,Seventy-five percent.
293225,L634501,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
293226,L634496,u8697,m590,DAVID,I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
293227,L634495,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,You've never been sick?
293228,L634931,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,Yes he is.
293229,L634930,u8697,m590,DAVID,He's kind of a miracle.
293230,L634929,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,"I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did."
293231,L634928,u8697,m590,DAVID,He's doing well today.
293232,L634927,u8697,m590,DAVID,We are.
293233,L634926,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
293234,L634925,u8697,m590,DAVID,It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
293235,L634924,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
293236,L634744,u8703,m590,WALKIE,Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
293237,L634743,u8697,m590,DAVID,When?
293238,L634742,u8703,m590,WALKIE,There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
293239,L634741,u8697,m590,DAVID,Yeah?
293240,L634547,u8703,m590,WALKIE,Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
293241,L634546,u8697,m590,DAVID,Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
293242,L634545,u8703,m590,WALKIE,He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
293243,L634544,u8697,m590,DAVID,What's he look like?
293244,L634543,u8703,m590,WALKIE,"Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name."
293245,L634798,u8697,m590,DAVID,Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
293246,L634797,u8700,m590,JEREMY,Don't be scared.
293247,L634796,u8697,m590,DAVID,Jeremy listen to what--
293248,L634795,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I'll just shoot him once.
293249,L634792,u8697,m590,DAVID,I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
293250,L634791,u8700,m590,JEREMY,You're lying.
293251,L634790,u8697,m590,DAVID,That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
293252,L634785,u8697,m590,DAVID,Elijah was wrong.
293253,L634784,u8700,m590,JEREMY,YOU WON'T GET HURT...
293254,L634695,u8700,m590,JEREMY,You're secret identity.  That man was right.
293255,L634694,u8697,m590,DAVID,Know what?
293256,L634693,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I know now.
293257,L634692,u8700,m590,JEREMY,Do you know why?
293258,L634691,u8697,m590,DAVID,That's great.
293259,L634690,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I'm not scared.
293260,L634689,u8697,m590,DAVID,I see.
293261,L634688,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I'm sleeping in my room.
293262,L634648,u8697,m590,DAVID,There's no more left?
293263,L634647,u8700,m590,JEREMY,All of it.
293264,L634646,u8697,m590,DAVID,How many did you put on that time?
293265,L634645,u8700,m590,JEREMY,Get mom.
293266,L634644,u8697,m590,DAVID,What do you do if something happens?
293267,L634638,u8697,m590,DAVID,Two hundred and seventy.
293268,L634637,u8700,m590,JEREMY,How much is it?
293269,L634635,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I lied.
293270,L634634,u8697,m590,DAVID,How much did you take off?
293271,L634632,u8700,m590,JEREMY,What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
293272,L634631,u8697,m590,DAVID,No Jeremy.
293273,L634630,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I mean if you knew karate?
293274,L634629,u8697,m590,DAVID,No.
293275,L634625,u8700,m590,JEREMY,How much can you lift?
293276,L634624,u8697,m590,DAVID,You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
293277,L634621,u8700,m590,JEREMY,What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
293278,L634620,u8697,m590,DAVID,No.
293279,L634619,u8700,m590,JEREMY,What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
293280,L634618,u8697,m590,DAVID,No.
293281,L634617,u8700,m590,JEREMY,You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
293282,L634614,u8697,m590,DAVID,There's nothing to do.
293283,L634613,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I'll help you.
293284,L634612,u8697,m590,DAVID,I'm going to work out.
293285,L634611,u8700,m590,JEREMY,What things?
293286,L634610,u8697,m590,DAVID,Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
293287,L634609,u8700,m590,JEREMY,Just one--
293288,L634608,u8697,m590,DAVID,Why'd you do that?
293289,L634607,u8700,m590,JEREMY,Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
293290,L634606,u8697,m590,DAVID,I'm going to go in.
293291,L634605,u8697,m590,DAVID,In under six seconds.  I've heard.
293292,L634604,u8700,m590,JEREMY,He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
293293,L634379,u8697,m590,DAVID,"How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?"
293294,L634378,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I won't make any noise.
293295,L634377,u8697,m590,DAVID,I think it's be better if I was alone.
293296,L634376,u8700,m590,JEREMY,I want to sleep here tonight.
293297,L634375,u8697,m590,DAVID,"Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?"
293298,L634922,u8704,m590,WOMAN,"That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind."
293299,L634921,u8697,m590,DAVID,He doesn't look very threatening.
293300,L634654,u8704,m590,WOMAN,Is David Dunne there?
293301,L634653,u8697,m590,DAVID,"Yeah, hello."
293302,L634327,u8704,m590,WOMAN,"This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God."
293303,L634326,u8697,m590,DAVID,Not really.
293304,L634325,u8704,m590,WOMAN,I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
293305,L634324,u8697,m590,DAVID,You represent someone in Philadelphia?
293306,L634323,u8697,m590,DAVID,"But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit."
293307,L634322,u8704,m590,WOMAN,Is that right?
293308,L634321,u8697,m590,DAVID,What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
293309,L634320,u8704,m590,WOMAN,It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
293310,L634319,u8697,m590,DAVID,You like sports?
293311,L634354,u8697,m590,DAVID,No.
293312,L634353,u8701,m590,MAN IN SCRUBS,Did you get up from your seat?
293313,L634352,u8697,m590,DAVID,No.
293314,L634351,u8701,m590,MAN IN SCRUBS,Was your family traveling with you?
293315,L634350,u8697,m590,DAVID,Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
293316,L634349,u8701,m590,MAN IN SCRUBS,In the passenger car?
293317,L634348,u8697,m590,DAVID,Against a window.
293318,L634347,u8701,m590,MAN IN SCRUBS,Where were you sitting on the train?
293319,L634346,u8697,m590,DAVID,Fine.
293320,L634345,u8701,m590,MAN IN SCRUBS,You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
293321,L634344,u8697,m590,DAVID,Okay.
293322,L634343,u8701,m590,MAN IN SCRUBS,How are you feeling?
293323,L634735,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
293324,L634734,u8702,m590,MEGAN,For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
293325,L634733,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
293326,L634732,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Is this a religious thing?
293327,L634730,u8702,m590,MEGAN,And what was that explanation?
293328,L634729,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,"There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true."
293329,L634721,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,...And everyone lived happily ever after.
293330,L634720,u8702,m590,MEGAN,"Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation."
293331,L634719,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,You and my mother would have a special connection.
293332,L634718,u8702,m590,MEGAN,"Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand."
293333,L634717,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,How so?
293334,L634716,u8702,m590,MEGAN,"...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together."
293335,L634715,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Now you're going to have to tell me more.
293336,L634713,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,How did you get together?
293337,L634712,u8702,m590,MEGAN,Twelve years.
293338,L634711,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,How long have you been married?
293339,L634710,u8702,m590,MEGAN,We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
293340,L634462,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,"On a bench, across the street."
293341,L634461,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Where is it?
293342,L634460,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,"Well, go get it then."
293343,L634459,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,Forget why. Do you want it or not?
293344,L634458,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,Why?
293345,L634457,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,...I got a present for you.
293346,L634454,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,"You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room."
293347,L634453,u8698,m590,ELIJAH,I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
293348,L634452,u8699,m590,ELIJAH'S MOTHER,No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
293349,L635478,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Innocent of what?
293350,L635477,u8705,m591,ALICE,"You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole."
293351,L635473,u8705,m591,ALICE,On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
293352,L635472,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?"
293353,L634995,u8705,m591,ALICE,Like whores?
293354,L634994,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way..."
293355,L634993,u8705,m591,ALICE,For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
293356,L634992,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,I fined 'em instead.
293357,L634991,u8705,m591,ALICE,You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
293358,L634972,u8705,m591,ALICE,"But what they done, they..."
293359,L634971,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice."
293360,L634970,u8705,m591,ALICE,A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
293361,L634967,u8705,m591,ALICE,All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
293362,L634966,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,No?
293363,L634965,u8705,m591,ALICE,"She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke."
293364,L635412,u8716,m591,SKINNY,Thank God.
293365,L635411,u8705,m591,ALICE,Rain's coming.
293366,L635072,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!"
293367,L635071,u8705,m591,ALICE,We was... lyin'.
293368,L635070,u8716,m591,SKINNY,You told them cowboys you had it.
293369,L635069,u8705,m591,ALICE,We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
293370,L635068,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"Where'd you get the money, huh?"
293371,L635662,u8705,m591,ALICE,"I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow."
293372,L635661,u8709,m591,DELILAH,He said...
293373,L635660,u8705,m591,ALICE,What wife? He don't have no wife.
293374,L635659,u8709,m591,DELILAH,"That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife..."
293375,L635658,u8705,m591,ALICE,"What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?"
293376,L635657,u8709,m591,DELILAH,I didn't think they'd really do it.
293377,L635206,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"Ah, I see."
293378,L635205,u8706,m591,BARBER,Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
293379,L635204,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?"
293380,L635203,u8706,m591,BARBER,Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
293381,L635202,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again."
293382,L635201,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?"
293383,L635200,u8706,m591,BARBER,"I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir."
293384,L635199,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied..."
293385,L635196,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
293386,L635195,u8708,m591,CLYDE,"Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns."
293387,L635194,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
293388,L635191,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,Maybe he ain't so tough.
293389,L635190,u8708,m591,CLYDE,"Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter."
293390,L635189,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,"He didn't say nothin', huh?"
293391,L635186,u8708,m591,CLYDE,"Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?"
293392,L635185,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,What'd he say?
293393,L635182,u8708,m591,CLYDE,'Course he's coming.
293394,L635181,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,He's coming ain't he?
293395,L635178,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,Building his porch!
293396,L635177,u8708,m591,CLYDE,Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
293397,L635176,u8707,m591,CHARLEY,Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
293398,L635681,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches."
293399,L635680,u8708,m591,CLYDE,Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
293400,L635679,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,He give 'em names?
293401,L635678,u8708,m591,CLYDE,Nope.
293402,L635677,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,He tell you where them others is?
293403,L634990,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna..."
293404,L634989,u8708,m591,CLYDE,"I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German..."
293405,L634963,u8708,m591,CLYDE,"Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, ""Skinny, you can't do that,"" an' he says, ""Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this"" an' I says, ""Bill's sleepin', Skinny,"" an'..."
293406,L634962,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?"
293407,L635571,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
293408,L635570,u8709,m591,DELILAH,She back in Kansas?
293409,L635569,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Yeah, I guess."
293410,L635568,u8709,m591,DELILAH,"I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't."
293411,L635567,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Yeah. See?
293412,L635566,u8709,m591,DELILAH,Your wife?
293413,L635565,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife..."
293414,L635563,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
293415,L635562,u8709,m591,DELILAH,"I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want."
293416,L635561,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Me? No. No, I guess not."
293417,L635560,u8709,m591,DELILAH,You want... a free one.
293418,L635559,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Oh. Yeah.
293419,L635558,u8709,m591,DELILAH,Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
293420,L635557,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Free ones?
293421,L635555,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Advances?
293422,L635554,u8709,m591,DELILAH,"Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment."
293423,L635553,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?"
293424,L635552,u8709,m591,DELILAH,Are you really going to kill them?
293425,L635550,u8714,m591,MUNNY,That big guy lookin' for me?
293426,L635549,u8709,m591,DELILAH,I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
293427,L635548,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
293428,L635547,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Three days? I must be.
293429,L635546,u8709,m591,DELILAH,Three days. Are you hungry?
293430,L635545,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Oh. How long I been here?
293431,L635544,u8709,m591,DELILAH,On the Bar T... looking for... them.
293432,L635543,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Scouting?
293433,L635542,u8709,m591,DELILAH,They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
293434,L635541,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?"
293435,L635540,u8709,m591,DELILAH,"You don't look nothin' like me, mister."
293436,L635539,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?"
293437,L635538,u8709,m591,DELILAH,You ain't dead.
293438,L635537,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I thought... you was an angel.
293439,L635400,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Oh yeah.
293440,L635399,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,Mmmm pistols.
293441,L635235,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?"
293442,L635234,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
293443,L635229,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"Be careful with those, sonny."
293444,L635228,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Charley, see what kind of ""books"" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet."
293445,L635227,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around."
293446,L635226,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?"
293447,L635222,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Oh.
293448,L635221,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,Books. He's my biographer.
293449,L635215,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... ""friends."""
293450,L635214,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?"
293451,L635213,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
293452,L635212,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it."
293453,L635211,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,"Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers."
293454,L635210,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?"
293455,L635209,u8710,m591,ENGLISH BOB,Shit and fried eggs.
293456,L635208,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob."
293457,L635673,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
293458,L635672,u8711,m591,FUZZY,"Uh... a little, maybe."
293459,L635671,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Those cowboys messin' him up?
293460,L635670,u8711,m591,FUZZY,No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
293461,L635669,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,He admit it?
293462,L635668,u8711,m591,FUZZY,"Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'..."
293463,L635667,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Alive?
293464,L635666,u8711,m591,FUZZY,"We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we..."
293465,L635098,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
293466,L635097,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two."
293467,L635096,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,I could run off them whores.
293468,L635095,u8716,m591,SKINNY,You could run off them two cowboys.
293469,L635094,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"That much, huh?"
293470,L635093,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe."
293471,L635092,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"They really got all that money, them whores?"
293472,L635091,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas."
293473,L635090,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
293474,L635089,u8716,m591,SKINNY,I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
293475,L635088,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,All week?
293476,L635087,u8716,m591,SKINNY,Yup.
293477,L635086,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
293478,L635085,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah."
293479,L635084,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons."
293480,L635083,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks..."
293481,L635082,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Yeah?
293482,L635079,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
293483,L635078,u8716,m591,SKINNY,What's all that wood?
293484,L635077,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all."
293485,L635076,u8716,m591,SKINNY,Heard you done the roof yourself.
293486,L635075,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?"
293487,L635074,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"Hit your finger, huh?"
293488,L634981,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
293489,L634980,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore."
293490,L634979,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it."
293491,L634978,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
293492,L634977,u8716,m591,SKINNY,Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
293493,L634976,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Property.
293494,L634975,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital."
293495,L634974,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,No?
293496,L634973,u8716,m591,SKINNY,"Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this."
293497,L635831,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole."
293498,L635830,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"""Deserve"" don't mean shit, Little Bill."
293499,L635829,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
293500,L635808,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys."
293501,L635807,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children."
293502,L635806,u8714,m591,MUNNY,He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
293503,L635460,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Well, uh... it ain't loaded."
293504,L635459,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot."
293505,L635458,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Uh... yeah. Yeah.
293506,L635457,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
293507,L635456,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed."
293508,L635455,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?"
293509,L635454,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Uh, William... uh... Hendershot."
293510,L635453,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,What's your name?
293511,L635452,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Like I said, I..."
293512,L635451,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"You're spillin' your whiskey, mister."
293513,L635450,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns."
293514,L635449,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?"
293515,L635448,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms."
293516,L635447,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
293517,L635446,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk."
293518,L635430,u8719,m591,WW,Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
293519,L635429,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,What?
293520,L635428,u8719,m591,WW,Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
293521,L635427,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles."
293522,L635426,u8719,m591,WW,Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
293523,L635425,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
293524,L635424,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character."
293525,L635423,u8719,m591,WW,Did you... kill him?
293526,L635422,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"""Well, Jim,"" I says, ""it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."""
293527,L635379,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Give it to him.
293528,L635378,u8719,m591,WW,R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
293529,L635372,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
293530,L635371,u8719,m591,WW,Is... is it... loaded?
293531,L635370,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
293532,L635368,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?"
293533,L635367,u8719,m591,WW,But... if he doesn't miss?
293534,L635366,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
293535,L635365,u8719,m591,WW,But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
293536,L635341,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver."
293537,L635340,u8719,m591,WW,You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
293538,L635339,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
293539,L635338,u8719,m591,WW,And?
293540,L635337,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry..."
293541,L635336,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Some folks did call Old Corky ""Two Gun"" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell."
293542,L635335,u8719,m591,WW,But he was called...
293543,L635334,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of."
293544,L635333,u8719,m591,WW,You were there?
293545,L635332,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that."
293546,L635331,u8719,m591,WW,"I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which..."
293547,L635330,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Duck, I says.  ""You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran,"" said the duck. ""You must apologize."" But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."""
293548,L635329,u8719,m591,WW,Duke.
293549,L635328,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Meaning the duck himself, I guess."
293550,L635327,u8719,m591,WW,"Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and..."
293551,L635326,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher."
293552,L635325,u8719,m591,WW,"Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place."
293553,L635323,u8719,m591,WW,Uh... Duke.
293554,L635322,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?"
293555,L635232,u8719,m591,WW,D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
293556,L635231,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,The... Duck of Death.
293557,L635225,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?"
293558,L635224,u8719,m591,WW,It's only a b-b-b-book...
293559,L635220,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,Letters?
293560,L635219,u8719,m591,WW,N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
293561,L635218,u8712,m591,LITTLE BILL,"You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?"
293562,L635775,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid."
293563,L635774,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,"N-no, sir?"
293564,L635773,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?"
293565,L635772,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,"He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said ""Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?"" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73."
293566,L635771,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
293567,L635770,u8714,m591,MUNNY,An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
293568,L635769,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
293569,L635768,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Then... what?
293570,L635767,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,"L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then..."
293571,L635766,u8714,m591,MUNNY,What'd Ned say?
293572,L635765,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
293573,L635764,u8714,m591,MUNNY,The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
293574,L635763,u8714,m591,MUNNY,They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
293575,L635762,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,"In front of Greely's. It says, ""This here is what happens to..."""
293576,L635761,u8714,m591,MUNNY,A sign on him?
293577,L635760,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
293578,L635759,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
293579,L635758,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
293580,L635757,u8714,m591,MUNNY,He hanged him?  Shot him down?
293581,L635756,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
293582,L635755,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Who killed him?
293583,L635754,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?"
293584,L635753,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
293585,L635752,u8714,m591,MUNNY,No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
293586,L635751,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,He's... he's dead.
293587,L635750,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before..."
293588,L635749,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,Ned's share?
293589,L635745,u8713,m591,LITTLE SUE,"Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them."
293590,L635744,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
293591,L635791,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle."
293592,L635790,u8717,m591,THE KID,"You're gonna kill him, ain't you?"
293593,L635789,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
293594,L635788,u8717,m591,THE KID,Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
293595,L635787,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles."
293596,L635785,u8717,m591,THE KID,"I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess."
293597,L635784,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
293598,L635783,u8717,m591,THE KID,You could have it. All of it.
293599,L635782,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"You better get on back, Miss."
293600,L635781,u8717,m591,THE KID,You... gonna take... the money?
293601,L635778,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Sure. Sure, Bill."

293603,L635776,u8717,m591,THE KID,Wha... what f-for?
293604,L635748,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it."
293605,L635747,u8717,m591,THE KID,"I trust you, Bill."
293606,L635743,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"We all got it comin', Kid."
293607,L635742,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'."
293608,L635741,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have..."
293609,L635740,u8717,m591,THE KID,Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
293610,L635739,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Take a drink, Kid."
293611,L635738,u8717,m591,THE KID,H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
293612,L635737,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Well, that fella today, you shot him alright."
293613,L635736,u8717,m591,THE KID,How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
293614,L635735,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Yeah?
293615,L635734,u8717,m591,THE KID,First one I ever killed.
293616,L635733,u8714,m591,MUNNY,First one what?
293617,L635732,u8717,m591,THE KID,That was... the first one.
293618,L635731,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Yeah.
293619,L635730,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Say, Bill..."
293620,L635727,u8717,m591,THE KID,Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
293621,L635726,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Yeah, I guess so."
293622,L635723,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Just SHOOT!
293623,L635722,u8717,m591,THE KID,I can't see 'em.
293624,L635721,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Cover me, Kid, while I mount."
293625,L635719,u8717,m591,THE KID,Yeah.
293626,L635718,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Did... you... get... him?
293627,L635712,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Yup.
293628,L635711,u8717,m591,THE KID,Is it him?
293629,L635691,u8714,m591,MUNNY,You can shoot him.
293630,L635690,u8717,m591,THE KID,You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
293631,L635689,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Yup.
293632,L635688,u8717,m591,THE KID,Tell me right off if you see him.
293633,L635687,u8714,m591,MUNNY,He's in there.
293634,L635686,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money."
293635,L635685,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Yeah, he's in there."
293636,L635684,u8717,m591,THE KID,You still think he's in there?
293637,L635683,u8714,m591,MUNNY,It's gonna get riper yet.
293638,L635639,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Shut up, Kid."
293639,L635638,u8717,m591,THE KID,You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
293640,L635632,u8714,m591,MUNNY,After a ways.
293641,L635631,u8717,m591,THE KID,When we gonna double back?
293642,L635629,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Yeah.
293643,L635628,u8717,m591,THE KID,They takin' water?
293644,L635610,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think."
293645,L635609,u8717,m591,THE KID,He ain't killed.
293646,L635606,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I got him.
293647,L635605,u8717,m591,THE KID,You missed him? You didn't...?
293648,L635604,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Better re-load it.
293649,L635591,u8717,m591,THE KID,"What happened, did you hit him?"
293650,L635590,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Shit!
293651,L635585,u8717,m591,THE KID,What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
293652,L635584,u8714,m591,MUNNY,If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
293653,L635583,u8717,m591,THE KID,What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
293654,L635581,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him."
293655,L635580,u8717,m591,THE KID,Did you kill him?
293656,L635577,u8714,m591,MUNNY,He got the boy's horse.
293657,L635576,u8717,m591,THE KID,He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
293658,L635575,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Finish him, Ned."
293659,L635360,u8717,m591,THE KID,You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
293660,L635359,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Get some sleep, Kid."
293661,L635351,u8717,m591,THE KID,You don't recollect!
293662,L635350,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Well... I don't recollect.
293663,L635349,u8717,m591,THE KID,"An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that."
293664,L635348,u8714,m591,MUNNY,What business?
293665,L635347,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?"
293666,L635318,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?"
293667,L635317,u8717,m591,THE KID,Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
293668,L635316,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?"
293669,L635297,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Lookin' at?
293670,L635296,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?"
293671,L635295,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Huh?
293672,L635294,u8717,m591,THE KID,"What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?"
293673,L635291,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"He's my partner. He don't go, I don't."
293674,L635290,u8717,m591,THE KID,You're goin' back with him?
293675,L635289,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!"
293676,L635288,u8717,m591,THE KID,No.
293677,L635287,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Three ways, I figured."
293678,L635279,u8717,m591,THE KID,I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
293679,L635278,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe..."
293680,L635275,u8717,m591,THE KID,Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
293681,L635274,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'..."
293682,L635048,u8717,m591,THE KID,"If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala."
293683,L635047,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I don't never see nobody anyhow.
293684,L635046,u8717,m591,THE KID,Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
293685,L635045,u8717,m591,THE KID,Oh.
293686,L635044,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Been gone near three years now.
293687,L635043,u8717,m591,THE KID,Huh?
293688,L635042,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"She's passed on, Kid."
293689,L635041,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy..."
293690,L635040,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness."
293691,L635037,u8717,m591,THE KID,Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
293692,L635036,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Jesus!
293693,L635035,u8717,m591,THE KID,"For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too."
293694,L635034,u8714,m591,MUNNY,What for?
293695,L635033,u8717,m591,THE KID,Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
293696,L635032,u8714,m591,MUNNY,About what?
293697,L635031,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well, how about it?"
293698,L635030,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Oh.
293699,L635029,u8717,m591,THE KID,On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
293700,L635028,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Schofield? You from Schofield?
293701,L635027,u8717,m591,THE KID,"I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me."
293702,L635026,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"He said that, huh?"

293805,L635130,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up."
293806,L635129,u8715,m591,NED,"Well, she..."
293807,L635128,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more."
293808,L635127,u8715,m591,NED,It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
293809,L635126,u8714,m591,MUNNY,She gave me the evil eye.
293810,L635125,u8715,m591,NED,Sally?
293811,L635124,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me."

293819,L635115,u8715,m591,NED,"This Kid, what's he like?"
293820,L635114,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Two weeks, I guess."
293821,L635113,u8715,m591,NED,"How long you gonna be, Bill?"
293822,L635111,u8715,m591,NED,"Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive."
293823,L635110,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess."
293824,L635109,u8715,m591,NED,"Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?"
293825,L635108,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"We done stuff before for money, Ned."
293826,L635107,u8715,m591,NED,"Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em..."

293828,L635105,u8715,m591,NED,How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
293829,L635104,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
293830,L635103,u8715,m591,NED,"We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers."
293831,L635862,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody."
293832,L635861,u8718,m591,WILL,I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
293833,L635860,u8714,m591,MUNNY,"Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more."
293834,L635859,u8718,m591,WILL,N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...

293853,L635840,u8714,m591,MUNNY,I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
293854,L635839,u8718,m591,WILL,"Hullo, paw."
293855,L635050,u8714,m591,MUNNY,Best we move that pig.

293866,L635529,u8715,m591,NED,"You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?"
293867,L635528,u8717,m591,THE KID,That ain't what I mean.
293868,L635527,u8715,m591,NED,We'll bury him.
293869,L635526,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well, suppose he does?"

293871,L635524,u8717,m591,THE KID,"He's gonna die, ain't he?"
293872,L635510,u8717,m591,THE KID,Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.

293875,L635507,u8715,m591,NED,"Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?"
293876,L635500,u8717,m591,THE KID,We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
293877,L635499,u8715,m591,NED,I don't kill nobody without him.
293878,L635498,u8717,m591,THE KID,Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
293879,L635497,u8715,m591,NED,We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
293880,L635491,u8717,m591,THE KID,"That was your idea, I wanted to..."
293881,L635490,u8715,m591,NED,"Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window."
293882,L635489,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an..."
293883,L635488,u8715,m591,NED,"He ain't as tough as you, Kid."
293884,L635487,u8717,m591,THE KID,"He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?"
293885,L635485,u8717,m591,THE KID,He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
293886,L635484,u8715,m591,NED,"Move the candle closer, I can't see."
293887,L635483,u8717,m591,THE KID,His pistol must of jammed.
293888,L635482,u8715,m591,NED,Plenty of times.
293889,L635481,u8717,m591,THE KID,Jesus.  You done this before?
293890,L635358,u8717,m591,THE KID,Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
293891,L635357,u8715,m591,NED,"How many you killed, Kid?"
293892,L635356,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape."
293893,L635355,u8715,m591,NED,I don't like the question.
293894,L635354,u8717,m591,THE KID,How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
293895,L635353,u8715,m591,NED,Yeah.
293896,L635352,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Say, Ned... ?"
293897,L635315,u8717,m591,THE KID,"I ain't blind, you asshole."
293898,L635314,u8715,m591,NED,"He's blind, for Chri..."
293899,L635313,u8717,m591,THE KID,Fuck you.

293902,L635310,u8715,m591,NED,We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
293903,L635309,u8717,m591,THE KID,Far enough.
293904,L635302,u8715,m591,NED,I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
293905,L635301,u8717,m591,THE KID,Yeah?
293906,L635300,u8715,m591,NED,"You was right to change your mind, Kid."
293907,L635299,u8717,m591,THE KID,"Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them."
293908,L635298,u8715,m591,NED,"Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass."
293909,L635286,u8717,m591,THE KID,You gonna share your half with him?
293910,L635285,u8715,m591,NED,"Well, you was shootin' every which way an'..."
293911,L635284,u8717,m591,THE KID,Nothin's bent.
293912,L635283,u8715,m591,NED,I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
293913,L635277,u8717,m591,THE KID,"I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella."
293914,L635276,u8715,m591,NED,"Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'..."
293915,L635273,u8717,m591,THE KID,Thought you was followin' me.
293916,L635272,u8715,m591,NED,"What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?"
293917,L636533,u8720,m592,BAER,There's more.
293918,L636532,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Keyser Soze
293919,L636526,u8728,m592,KUJAN,And ?
293920,L636525,u8720,m592,BAER,A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
293921,L636359,u8720,m592,BAER,Bear with me here...
293922,L636358,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Who ?
293923,L636357,u8720,m592,BAER,They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
293924,L636356,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I don't get it.
293925,L636355,u8720,m592,BAER,He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
293926,L636354,u8728,m592,KUJAN,What was the money for?
293927,L636353,u8720,m592,BAER,"We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it."
293928,L636352,u8728,m592,KUJAN,There was ninety-one million -
293929,L636351,u8720,m592,BAER,You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
293930,L636350,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Yeah.
293931,L636349,u8720,m592,BAER,I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
293932,L636348,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Jack. What are you doing here?
293933,L636437,u8721,m592,BODI,He says the hair is longer and lighter.
293934,L636436,u8727,m592,KOVASH,&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
293935,L636435,u8721,m592,BODI,&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
293936,L636434,u8727,m592,KOVASH,&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
293937,L636433,u8721,m592,BODI,+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
293938,L636432,u8727,m592,KOVASH,&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
293939,L636283,u8721,m592,BODI,He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
293940,L636282,u8727,m592,KOVASH,&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
293941,L636273,u8721,m592,BODI,No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
293942,L636272,u8727,m592,KOVASH,"&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;"
293943,L636267,u8727,m592,KOVASH,&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
293944,L636266,u8721,m592,BODI,Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
293945,L636263,u8721,m592,BODI,"He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something."
293946,L636262,u8727,m592,KOVASH,&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
293947,L636152,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Edie, please."
293948,L636151,u8722,m592,EDIE,"I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it."
293949,L636150,u8725,m592,KEATON,"That's enough, Edie."
293950,L636131,u8725,m592,KEATON,Alright.
293951,L636130,u8722,m592,EDIE,"Come home, Dean."
293952,L636126,u8722,m592,EDIE,"Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?"
293953,L636125,u8725,m592,KEATON,They ruined me tonight.
293954,L636124,u8722,m592,EDIE,I love you.
293955,L636123,u8725,m592,KEATON,They'll never stop.
293956,L636122,u8722,m592,EDIE,"Don't give up on me now, Dean."
293957,L636121,u8725,m592,KEATON,"No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished."
293958,L636120,u8722,m592,EDIE,"Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -"
293959,L636119,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am."
293960,L636118,u8722,m592,EDIE,They just said they wanted time.
293961,L636117,u8725,m592,KEATON,Goddamnit.
293962,L636116,u8722,m592,EDIE,They want more time to think about investing.
293963,L636115,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?"
293964,L636114,u8722,m592,EDIE,I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
293965,L636112,u8725,m592,KEATON,Just forget about it.
293966,L636111,u8722,m592,EDIE,...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
293967,L635887,u8722,m592,EDIE,You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
293968,L635886,u8725,m592,KEATON,I'm having a stroke.
293969,L635885,u8722,m592,EDIE,"Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude."
293970,L636149,u8722,m592,EDIE,"A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?"
293971,L636148,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Umm ...
293972,L636147,u8722,m592,EDIE,"So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?"
293973,L636140,u8732,m592,VERBAL,A glass of water would be nice.
293974,L636139,u8722,m592,EDIE,"I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?"
293975,L636138,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I hope I didn't disturb you.
293976,L636137,u8722,m592,EDIE,I know who he is.
293977,L636401,u8723,m592,FENSTER,I don't know. This is bad.
293978,L636400,u8725,m592,KEATON,Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
293979,L636399,u8723,m592,FENSTER,Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
293980,L636398,u8723,m592,FENSTER,I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
293981,L636397,u8725,m592,KEATON,This is not right.
293982,L635984,u8725,m592,KEATON,I don't want to know.
293983,L635983,u8723,m592,FENSTER,Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
293984,L635981,u8723,m592,FENSTER,I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
293985,L635980,u8725,m592,KEATON,"It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do."
293986,L635979,u8723,m592,FENSTER,So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
293987,L635978,u8725,m592,KEATON,How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
293988,L635977,u8725,m592,KEATON,This whole thing was a shakedown.
293989,L635976,u8723,m592,FENSTER,Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
293990,L635975,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet ."
293991,L635974,u8723,m592,FENSTER,"I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus."
293992,L636403,u8723,m592,FENSTER,"The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity."
293993,L636402,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
293994,L636396,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,They fucking know everything.
293995,L636395,u8723,m592,FENSTER,"Everybody I ever worked with, did time with."
293996,L636322,u8723,m592,FENSTER,RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
293997,L636321,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,"DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS."
293998,L636213,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,"We all go. How about it, Keaton?"
293999,L636212,u8723,m592,FENSTER,Then who goes?
294000,L636211,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
294001,L635968,u8723,m592,FENSTER,Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
294002,L635967,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,You are a criminal.
294003,L635966,u8723,m592,FENSTER,"You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal."
294004,L636494,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing."
294005,L636493,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,Can we stealth these guys?
294006,L636492,u8725,m592,KEATON,"It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty."
294007,L636458,u8725,m592,KEATON,Dig.
294008,L636457,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,"Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him."
294009,L635999,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,What do you care what he says?
294010,L635998,u8725,m592,KEATON,Why don't you just calm down'
294011,L635988,u8725,m592,KEATON,His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
294012,L635987,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,"How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?"
294013,L635986,u8725,m592,KEATON,He's alright.
294014,L635971,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,"The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?"
294015,L635970,u8725,m592,KEATON,You heard right.
294016,L636498,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,"If I'm going in, I want a stake."
294017,L636497,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Did you hear what he just said?
294018,L636496,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,Me too.
294019,L636460,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,I can run. I got no problem with that.
294020,L636459,u8732,m592,VERBAL,What are we gonna do?
294021,L635990,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,"Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up."
294022,L635989,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Roger really. People say I talk too much.
294023,L635951,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
294024,L635950,u8724,m592,HOCKNEY,I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
294025,L636514,u8725,m592,KEATON,Just do what I tell you.
294026,L636513,u8732,m592,VERBAL,What if I
294027,L636512,u8725,m592,KEATON,"I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way."
294028,L636511,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Keaton, I can't just -"
294029,L636503,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Hungarian?
294030,L636502,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Russian, I think. I don't know."
294031,L636501,u8732,m592,VERBAL,What-are they speaking?
294032,L636372,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Who's Keyser Soze?
294033,L636371,u8725,m592,KEATON,What is this?
294034,L636314,u8725,m592,KEATON,Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
294035,L636313,u8732,m592,VERBAL,What is it Keaton?
294036,L636219,u8725,m592,KEATON,We'll make it.
294037,L636218,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
294038,L636217,u8725,m592,KEATON,We'll make it.
294039,L636188,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Not if we do it my way.
294040,L636187,u8725,m592,KEATON,No killing?
294041,L636186,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Maybe more.
294042,L636185,u8725,m592,KEATON,Three million?
294043,L636184,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you."
294044,L636183,u8725,m592,KEATON,Fenster and Hockney?
294045,L636182,u8732,m592,VERBAL,McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
294046,L636181,u8725,m592,KEATON,How are they going to do it?
294047,L636180,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
294048,L636179,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Well, I'm sorry."
294049,L636178,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I'11 be alright.
294050,L636177,u8725,m592,KEATON,You okay?
294051,L636176,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I was out of line.
294052,L636174,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool."
294053,L636173,u8725,m592,KEATON,You watch your mouth.
294054,L636170,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
294055,L636169,u8725,m592,KEATON,Tough break.
294056,L636168,u8732,m592,VERBAL,They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
294057,L636167,u8725,m592,KEATON,What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
294058,L636166,u8732,m592,VERBAL,You have to come.
294059,L636165,u8725,m592,KEATON,Never heard of him.
294060,L636164,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
294061,L636163,u8725,m592,KEATON,What fence? Who?
294062,L636162,u8732,m592,VERBAL,McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
294063,L636161,u8725,m592,KEATON,They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
294064,L636158,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you."
294065,L636157,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Don't hurt me.
294066,L636156,u8732,m592,VERBAL,If you'll just let me -
294067,L636155,u8725,m592,KEATON,Get out.
294068,L636144,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more."
294069,L636143,u8725,m592,KEATON,"I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -"
294070,L636142,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
294071,L636141,u8725,m592,KEATON,What the hell do you want?
294072,L636136,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at"
294073,L636135,u8732,m592,VERBAL,How do you do?
294074,L635994,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"I walked. Ninety days, suspended."
294075,L635993,u8725,m592,KEATON,"You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?"
294076,L635992,u8732,m592,VERBAL,County. I was in for fraud.
294077,L635991,u8725,m592,KEATON,We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
294078,L635960,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been"
294079,L635959,u8733,m592,VOICE,"You know damn well, dead-man."
294080,L635958,u8725,m592,KEATON,with what?
294081,L635905,u8733,m592,VOICE,This I had to see myself.
294082,L635904,u8725,m592,KEATON,Let's say for example -
294083,L635870,u8725,m592,KEATON,What time is it?
294084,L635869,u8733,m592,VOICE,Ready?
294085,L635868,u8725,m592,KEATON,"I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser."
294086,L635867,u8733,m592,VOICE,"How are you, Keaton?"
294087,L636487,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
294088,L636486,u8725,m592,KEATON,You're lying.
294089,L636485,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,"No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus."
294090,L636484,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
294091,L636483,u8725,m592,KEATON,What did you say?
294092,L636481,u8725,m592,KEATON,We'll see.
294093,L636480,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,"I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined."
294094,L636478,u8725,m592,KEATON,Neither do we.
294095,L636477,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
294096,L636476,u8725,m592,KEATON,"We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off."
294097,L636475,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,"Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us."
294098,L636474,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
294099,L636473,u8725,m592,KEATON,"Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here."
294100,L636472,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,Mr. Soze will be most -
294101,L636471,u8725,m592,KEATON,The answer is no.
294102,L636384,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,"Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people."
294103,L636383,u8725,m592,KEATON,What about Redfoot?
294104,L636382,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,"Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point."
294105,L636381,u8725,m592,KEATON,You set up the line-up.
294106,L636370,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,I work for Keyser Sate.
294107,L636369,u8725,m592,KEATON,Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
294108,L636368,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
294109,L636367,u8725,m592,KEATON,Who's your boss?
294110,L636366,u8726,m592,KOBAYASHI,"My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit."
294111,L636339,u8725,m592,KEATON,Tell him we'll meet.
294112,L636338,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
294113,L636337,u8725,m592,KEATON,We want to meet him.
294114,L636336,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
294115,L636335,u8725,m592,KEATON,Who is he?
294116,L636334,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
294117,L636333,u8725,m592,KEATON,You didn't know.
294118,L636332,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,Get a grip. I didn't know.
294119,L636310,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
294120,L636309,u8725,m592,KEATON,A little of both.
294121,L636308,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,Business or personal?
294122,L636307,u8725,m592,KEATON,Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
294123,L636306,u8725,m592,KEATON,I shivved him.
294124,L636305,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,"I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved."
294125,L636304,u8725,m592,KEATON,A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
294126,L636303,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
294127,L636298,u8731,m592,REDFOOT,I've got a ton of work and no good people.
294128,L636297,u8725,m592,KEATON,We're on vacation.
294129,L636626,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Nothing. Something I - forget it.
294130,L636625,u8729,m592,RAB IN,What?
294131,L636624,u8728,m592,KUJAN,A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
294132,L636623,u8729,m592,RAB IN,Waste of time.
294133,L636622,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I'11 find him.
294134,L636621,u8729,m592,RAB IN,"Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again."
294135,L636620,u8728,m592,KUJAN,No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
294136,L636619,u8729,m592,RAB IN,Which is shit.
294137,L636618,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
294138,L636047,u8729,m592,RAB IN,Where?
294139,L636046,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Someplace else, then."
294140,L636045,u8729,m592,RAB IN,He won't go into the interrogation room.
294141,L636041,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I want to see him.
294142,L636040,u8729,m592,RAB IN,"Two hours, tops."
294143,L636039,u8728,m592,KUJAN,When does he post bail?
294144,L636037,u8728,m592,KUJAN,What'the fuck is that?
294145,L636036,u8729,m592,RAB IN,Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
294146,L636035,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Did they charge him with anything?
294147,L636034,u8729,m592,RAB IN,"The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal."
294148,L636033,u8728,m592,KUJAN,What do you mean I can't see him?
294149,L636528,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Kobayashi.
294150,L636527,u8730,m592,RABIN,His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
294151,L636053,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead."
294152,L636052,u8730,m592,RABIN,"That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know."
294153,L636051,u8728,m592,KUJAN,You know damn well what I think.
294154,L636050,u8730,m592,RABIN,And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
294155,L636049,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?"
294156,L636048,u8730,m592,RABIN,"No, no, no, no, no."
294157,L636044,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time."
294158,L636043,u8730,m592,RABIN,"Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired"
294159,L636613,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's"
294160,L636612,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there."
294161,L636611,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop."
294162,L636610,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's."
294163,L636609,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
294164,L636608,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you."
294165,L636607,u8732,m592,VERBAL,You think he's..?
294166,L636606,u8728,m592,KUJAN,You're not safe on your own.
294167,L636605,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't"
294168,L636604,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Why lie about everything else, then?"
294169,L636603,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
294170,L636602,u8732,m592,VERBAL,It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
294171,L636601,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth."
294172,L636598,u8728,m592,KUJAN,He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
294173,L636597,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I knew him. He would never -
294174,L636596,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die."
294175,L636595,u8732,m592,VERBAL,This is all bullshit.
294176,L636594,u8728,m592,KUJAN,He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
294177,L636593,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Edie...
294178,L636591,u8728,m592,KUJAN,THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
294179,L636590,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO."
294180,L636588,u8732,m592,VERBAL,NO.
294181,L636587,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Keaton was Keyser Soze
294182,L636586,u8732,m592,VERBAL,No...
294183,L636585,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will."
294184,L636584,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Because he was my friend.
294185,L636583,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?"
294186,L636582,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Edie.
294187,L636581,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'"
294188,L636580,u8732,m592,VERBAL,He wanted me to live.
294189,L636579,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?"
294190,L636577,u8732,m592,VERBAL,But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
294191,L636576,u8728,m592,KUJAN,There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
294192,L636575,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I don't
294193,L636574,u8728,m592,KUJAN,But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
294194,L636573,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I said I never heard of him.
294195,L636572,u8728,m592,KUJAN,His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
294196,L636571,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I never heard of him.
294197,L636570,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder."
294198,L636564,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?"
294199,L636563,u8728,m592,KUJAN,But Keaton...
294200,L636562,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him."
294201,L636561,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Then why didn't you help him?
294202,L636560,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you."
294203,L636559,u8728,m592,KUJAN,YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
294204,L636558,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I don't know what you're talking about.
294205,L636557,u8728,m592,KUJAN,TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
294206,L636556,u8728,m592,KUJAN,YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
294207,L636555,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I don't.
294208,L636554,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at."
294209,L636552,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
294210,L636551,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Wait a minute.
294211,L636550,u8728,m592,KUJAN,A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
294212,L636469,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's"
294213,L636468,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Why didn't you say anything?
294214,L636467,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
294215,L636450,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
294216,L636449,u8728,m592,KUJAN,What call?
294217,L636448,u8732,m592,VERBAL,McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
294218,L636447,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Then what?
294219,L636445,u8728,m592,KUJAN,What happened?
294220,L636444,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Give a guy a break, huh?"
294221,L636443,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"You're stalling, Verbal."
294222,L636442,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us."
294223,L636441,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
294224,L636440,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything."
294225,L636439,u8728,m592,KUJAN,This is totally irrelevant.
294226,L636438,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois."
294227,L636430,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again."
294228,L636429,u8728,m592,KUJAN,So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
294229,L636428,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail."
294230,L636427,u8728,m592,KUJAN,If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
294231,L636426,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
294232,L636425,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
294233,L636424,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?"
294234,L636423,u8728,m592,KUJAN,And this is why you never told the D.A.
294235,L636422,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal."
294236,L636415,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE."
294237,L636414,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Do you believe in him, Verbal?"
294238,L636346,u8728,m592,KUJAN,And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
294239,L636345,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Right.
294240,L636344,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Came from Redfoot.
294241,L636343,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Kobayashi.
294242,L636342,u8728,m592,KUJAN,So this lawyer...
294243,L636248,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters."
294244,L636247,u8732,m592,VERBAL,No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
294245,L636246,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Is he the one that killed Keaton?
294246,L636245,u8732,m592,VERBAL,There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
294247,L636244,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,"
294248,L636243,u8732,m592,VERBAL,The D.A. gave me immunity.
294249,L636242,u8728,m592,KUJAN,You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
294250,L636239,u8728,m592,KUJAN,What lawyer?
294251,L636238,u8732,m592,VERBAL,He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
294252,L636237,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York."
294253,L636236,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I don't know about that.
294254,L636232,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either."
294255,L636231,u8732,m592,VERBAL,You got him wrong.
294256,L636230,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +"
294257,L636229,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +"
294258,L636228,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
294259,L636227,u8732,m592,VERBAL,That was all Fenster and McManus.
294260,L636226,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
294261,L636225,u8732,m592,VERBAL,He loved her.
294262,L636224,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her."
294263,L636223,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you."
294264,L636222,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy."
294265,L636107,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I'm not a rat.
294266,L636106,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
294267,L636105,u8732,m592,VERBAL,No.
294268,L636104,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?"
294269,L636103,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
294270,L636102,u8732,m592,VERBAL,There's nothing in there about Ruby.
294271,L636100,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
294272,L636099,u8732,m592,VERBAL,He didn't have my lawyer.
294273,L636098,u8728,m592,KUJAN,You know Ruby is in Attica?
294274,L636097,u8732,m592,VERBAL,You know a religious guy named John Paul?
294275,L636096,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?"
294276,L636095,u8732,m592,VERBAL,Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
294277,L636094,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity ."
294278,L636093,u8732,m592,VERBAL,That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
294279,L636092,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else."
294280,L636090,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I just want to hear your story.
294281,L636089,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?"
294282,L636088,u8728,m592,KUJAN,Keaton was a piece of shit.
294283,L636087,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit."
294284,L636086,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"He was a corrupt cop, Verbal."
294285,L636085,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I know he was good.
294286,L636084,u8728,m592,KUJAN,I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
294287,L636083,u8732,m592,VERBAL,I told the D.A. everything I know.
294288,L636082,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything."
294289,L636081,u8732,m592,VERBAL,"Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -"
294290,L636080,u8728,m592,KUJAN,"Verbal, you know we're trying to help you."
294291,L636029,u8734,m592,VOICE #1,"Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?"
294292,L636028,u8735,m592,VOICE #2,"Counselor, you're insulting me."
294293,L636027,u8734,m592,VOICE #1,Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
294294,L636026,u8735,m592,VOICE #2,You're joking.
294295,L636025,u8734,m592,VOICE #1,Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
294296,L636024,u8735,m592,VOICE #2,I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
294297,L636021,u8734,m592,VOICE #1,Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
294298,L636020,u8735,m592,VOICE #2,"Counselor, I will prosecute your client."
294299,L636019,u8734,m592,VOICE #1,Immunity.
294300,L636018,u8735,m592,VOICE #2,"May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here."
294301,L636017,u8734,m592,VOICE #1,"No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity."
294302,L636016,u8735,m592,VOICE #2,The district attorney's office will comply provided -
294303,L636015,u8734,m592,VOICE #1,"My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible."
294304,L637820,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Ah.  How did they treat you?
294305,L637819,u8736,m593,ABRAMS,Yes.
294306,L637818,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
294307,L637817,u8736,m593,ABRAMS,I'm fine.
294308,L637816,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
294309,L637815,u8736,m593,ABRAMS,Abrams...
294310,L637814,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Mr. Abraham...
294311,L638093,u8757,m593,YOUNG LAWYER,"As far as we know, nothing."
294312,L638092,u8737,m593,ALITO,And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
294313,L638091,u8757,m593,YOUNG LAWYER,Very good.
294314,L638090,u8737,m593,ALITO,How good's your intelligence?
294315,L638089,u8757,m593,YOUNG LAWYER,Nothing.
294316,L638088,u8737,m593,ALITO,What did he find?
294317,L638087,u8757,m593,YOUNG LAWYER,She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
294318,L638086,u8737,m593,ALITO,Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
294319,L637615,u8737,m593,ALITO,Yes.
294320,L637614,u8738,m593,BISHOP,I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
294321,L637613,u8737,m593,ALITO,"Well, of course, it's always dangerous ..."
294322,L637612,u8738,m593,BISHOP,"If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?"
294323,L637611,u8737,m593,ALITO,All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
294324,L637610,u8738,m593,BISHOP,So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
294325,L637609,u8737,m593,ALITO,"No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not."
294326,L637608,u8738,m593,BISHOP,I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
294327,L637607,u8737,m593,ALITO,Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
294328,L637606,u8738,m593,BISHOP,No -- we don't want this case in court.
294329,L637605,u8737,m593,ALITO,This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
294330,L637604,u8738,m593,BISHOP,... tell me about this case.
294331,L637603,u8737,m593,ALITO,The man's an ambulance chaser ...
294332,L637602,u8738,m593,BISHOP,Four cases in three years ...
294333,L637601,u8737,m593,ALITO,Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
294334,L637600,u8738,m593,BISHOP,He was accused of jury tampering.
294335,L637709,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it."
294336,L637708,u8738,m593,BISHOP,What is the truth?
294337,L637707,u8744,m593,GALVIN,And no one will know the truth.
294338,L637706,u8738,m593,BISHOP,Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
294339,L637705,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yes.  It would be.
294340,L637704,u8738,m593,BISHOP,That was our insurance company's recommendation.
294341,L637703,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
294342,L637702,u8738,m593,BISHOP,Yes.
294343,L637701,u8744,m593,GALVIN,You thought it was just.
294344,L637700,u8738,m593,BISHOP,We thought it was just.
294345,L637699,u8744,m593,GALVIN,How did you settle on the amount?
294346,L637698,u8738,m593,BISHOP,"It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture..."
294347,L637635,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
294348,L637634,u8744,m593,GALVIN,They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
294349,L637633,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,What does it mean?
294350,L637632,u8744,m593,GALVIN,That's the call that I'm waiting for.
294351,L637629,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
294352,L637628,u8744,m593,GALVIN,This is going to drive the ante up.
294353,L637627,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
294354,L637626,u8744,m593,GALVIN,You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
294355,L637625,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,It looks that way.
294356,L637624,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... he wants to testify ...?
294357,L637623,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
294358,L637622,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Gruber...
294359,L637621,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
294360,L637620,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
294361,L637619,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,"... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ..."
294362,L637618,u8739,m593,CLAIRE,Mickey told me to come back to work.
294363,L637617,u8744,m593,GALVIN,What are you doing here?
294364,L637971,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Tell us.
294365,L637970,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know..."
294366,L637969,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?"
294367,L637968,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Yes!
294368,L637967,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
294369,L637966,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,...We did everything we could...
294370,L637965,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form..."
294371,L637964,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Yes.
294372,L637963,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
294373,L637962,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"Well, we..."
294374,L637961,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,And what did your team do...
294375,L637960,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,That's right.
294376,L637959,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
294377,L637957,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
294378,L637956,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
294379,L637955,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Tell me one?
294380,L637954,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"Well, many reasons, actually..."
294381,L637953,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
294382,L637952,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins..."
294383,L637951,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?"
294384,L637950,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,We went to Code Blue...
294385,L637949,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,What did these people do when her heart stopped?
294386,L637948,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse..."
294387,L637947,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course..."
294388,L637946,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?"
294389,L637945,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Thank you.  When Debby...
294390,L637943,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,When she...
294391,L637942,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Anything special about the case?
294392,L637941,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Yes.
294393,L637940,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
294394,L637939,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Yes.
294395,L637938,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?"
294396,L637937,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,...I was one of a group of...
294397,L637936,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy..."
294398,L637935,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,I was her doctor.
294399,L637934,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Say it.
294400,L637933,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Yes.
294401,L637932,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor."
294402,L637931,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
294403,L637930,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient..."
294404,L638377,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives."
294405,L638376,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Objection!
294406,L638184,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
294407,L638183,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
294408,L638182,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"We've touched on this, his own witness has said..."
294409,L638181,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...to get her heartbeat back...?
294410,L638180,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Objection, we've..."
294411,L637795,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
294412,L637794,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Ed Concannon.
294413,L638125,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Objection.
294414,L638124,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I did.
294415,L638121,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine."
294416,L638120,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done."
294417,L638119,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?"
294418,L638118,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I'm on the staff of...
294419,L638117,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
294420,L638116,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I am seventy-four years old.
294421,L638115,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,How old are you?
294422,L638114,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
294423,L638113,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,...of Anesthesiology?
294424,L638112,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,Meth...Methodology and Technique...
294425,L638111,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,What book is that?
294426,L638110,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"Through, through his book."
294427,L638109,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,How is that?
294428,L638108,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I know of him.
294429,L638107,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
294430,L638106,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I'm just an M.D.
294431,L638105,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Orthopedics?
294432,L638104,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,No.
294433,L638103,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Neurology?
294434,L638102,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,No.
294435,L638101,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?"
294436,L638100,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State..."
294437,L638099,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?"
294438,L638098,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"Just as you are, Sir..."
294439,L638097,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
294440,L638096,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
294441,L638095,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?"
294442,L638404,u8747,m593,JUDGE,I'm going to uphold that.
294443,L638403,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here."
294444,L638402,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original..."
294445,L638401,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"...one moment, Mr. Concannon..."
294446,L638400,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form."
294447,L638395,u8747,m593,JUDGE,You may step down.
294448,L638394,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,No further questions.
294449,L638388,u8747,m593,JUDGE,I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
294450,L638387,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right..."
294451,L638329,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?"
294452,L638328,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Nothing further, your Honor."
294453,L638327,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Mr. Concannon...?
294454,L637805,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
294455,L637804,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Huh!
294456,L637803,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars."
294457,L638393,u8748,m593,KATHY,"After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse..."
294458,L638392,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"And why, please tell us, would you think that?"
294459,L638391,u8748,m593,KATHY,I thought I would need it.
294460,L638390,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
294461,L638386,u8748,m593,KATHY,Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
294462,L638385,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
294463,L638384,u8748,m593,KATHY,"Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure."
294464,L638383,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,You've just said you signed it.
294465,L638382,u8748,m593,KATHY,That's not my handwriting.
294466,L638381,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
294467,L638380,u8748,m593,KATHY,I do.  Yes.
294468,L638379,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
294469,L638378,u8748,m593,KATHY,They lied.
294470,L638375,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
294471,L638374,u8748,m593,KATHY,I...
294472,L638373,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?"
294473,L638372,u8748,m593,KATHY,I...yes.
294474,L638371,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
294475,L638370,u8748,m593,KATHY,I . . ..
294476,L638369,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?"
294477,L638368,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294478,L638367,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
294479,L638366,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294480,L638365,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Just now...
294481,L638364,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294482,L638363,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,"In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?"
294483,L638362,u8748,m593,KATHY,No.
294484,L638361,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,You would not...?
294485,L638360,u8748,m593,KATHY,I wouldn't do it.
294486,L638359,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
294487,L638358,u8748,m593,KATHY,It's a crime.
294488,L638357,u8740,m593,CONCANNON,You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
294489,L637854,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
294490,L637853,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back."
294491,L637852,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,"You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives."
294492,L637851,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars."
294493,L637850,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,"What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred..."
294494,L637849,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
294495,L637848,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,"You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister."
294496,L637847,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"It's all right, Mickey."
294497,L637846,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
294498,L637845,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Hold on a second.
294499,L637844,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
294500,L637596,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ..."
294501,L637595,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,What is this going to cost?
294502,L637592,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,We just ...
294503,L637591,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I completely understand ...
294504,L637590,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
294505,L637589,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
294506,L637588,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,"...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial..."
294507,L637585,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here."
294508,L637584,u8741,m593,DONEGHY,... that's all right.
294509,L637583,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
294510,L638038,u8752,m593,MICKEY,It's a common medical term.
294511,L638037,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,'Code Blue'...
294512,L638036,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?"
294513,L638035,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I..."
294514,L638034,u8752,m593,MICKEY,She getting good care over there?
294515,L638033,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I..."
294516,L638032,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say..."
294517,L638031,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I am on the staff of...
294518,L638030,u8752,m593,MICKEY,What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
294519,L638029,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I am seventy-four years old.
294520,L638028,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?"
294521,L638027,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
294522,L638026,u8752,m593,MICKEY,...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
294523,L638025,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
294524,L638024,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Why is that?
294525,L638023,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
294526,L638143,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I...um...
294527,L638142,u8747,m593,JUDGE,The Doctors were not negligent.
294528,L638141,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"I...given the limits of your question, that's correct."
294529,L638140,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?"
294530,L638139,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
294531,L638134,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,Well...
294532,L638133,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
294533,L638197,u8744,m593,GALVIN,No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
294534,L638196,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,You sure you don't want me to stay on.
294535,L638195,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yes...I...yes.
294536,L638194,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
294537,L638193,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home."
294538,L638192,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
294539,L638191,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"No, you did fine."
294540,L638190,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,I didn't do too well for you.
294541,L638132,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
294542,L638131,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?"
294543,L638130,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
294544,L638129,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?"
294545,L637985,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,There's nothing they can do to me.
294546,L637984,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I..."
294547,L637983,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,...What difference would...
294548,L637982,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they..."
294549,L637981,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,...I made a reservation at...
294550,L637980,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
294551,L637979,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,"From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case..."
294552,L637978,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
294553,L637977,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,That's what I'd planned to...
294554,L637976,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening..."
294555,L637974,u8742,m593,DR. THOMPSON,It was good of you to meet...
294556,L637973,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Dr. Thompson...?
294557,L638326,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Thank you.
294558,L638325,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
294559,L638324,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?"
294560,L638323,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,"She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission."
294561,L638322,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?"
294562,L638321,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Yes.
294563,L638320,u8744,m593,GALVIN,And you wrote that...
294564,L638319,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,I.  Yes.  It is.
294565,L638318,u8744,m593,GALVIN,'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
294566,L638317,u8743,m593,DR. TOWLER,Yes.  I wrote it.
294567,L638316,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?"
294568,L637672,u8745,m593,GRUBER,To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
294569,L637671,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Uh, why, why are you doing this?"
294570,L637670,u8745,m593,GRUBER,... that's perfectly all right.
294571,L637669,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Thank you ...
294572,L637667,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"... the case with anyone.  And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ..."
294573,L637666,u8745,m593,GRUBER,I understand.
294574,L637665,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ..."
294575,L637664,u8745,m593,GRUBER,Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
294576,L637663,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition.."
294577,L637662,u8745,m593,GRUBER,"What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ..."
294578,L637661,u8744,m593,GALVIN,The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
294579,L637659,u8745,m593,GRUBER,"Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?"
294580,L637658,u8744,m593,GALVIN,The most respected ...
294581,L637657,u8745,m593,GRUBER,I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
294582,L637656,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Do you know who her doctors were?
294583,L637655,u8745,m593,GRUBER,Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
294584,L637654,u8744,m593,GALVIN,) I'm sorry ...?
294585,L637653,u8745,m593,GRUBER,Her doctors killed her.
294586,L637652,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ..."
294587,L637651,u8745,m593,GRUBER,Why?
294588,L637650,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yes.
294589,L637649,u8745,m593,GRUBER,You're going to settle out of court?
294590,L637648,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yes.
294591,L637647,u8745,m593,GRUBER,... and you're going to do that?
294592,L637646,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ..."
294593,L637645,u8745,m593,GRUBER,Right.  Who called?
294594,L637644,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ..."
294595,L637643,u8745,m593,GRUBER,... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
294596,L637642,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
294597,L637641,u8745,m593,GRUBER,I read the hospital report on your client.
294598,L637640,u8745,m593,GRUBER,That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
294599,L637639,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I appreciate--a man as busy as--
294600,L637638,u8745,m593,GRUBER,"Yes?  Galvin, right?"
294601,L637637,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Dr. Gruber ...
294602,L638016,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,"Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores."
294603,L638015,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand..."
294604,L638014,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,"You know, you're pushy, fella..."
294605,L638013,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Then why don't you testify?
294606,L638012,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
294607,L638011,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
294608,L638010,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
294609,L638009,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Who are you protecting, then?"
294610,L638008,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,"I didn't do it, Mister."
294611,L638007,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Who put my client in the hospital for life.
294612,L638006,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,And ask me what?
294613,L638005,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand."
294614,L638004,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
294615,L638003,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,Nothing happened.
294616,L638002,u8744,m593,GALVIN,You know what happened.
294617,L638001,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,I've got nothing to say to you.
294618,L638000,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big..."
294619,L637999,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
294620,L637998,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?"
294621,L637997,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,No.
294622,L637996,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?"
294623,L637995,u8751,m593,MARY ROONEY,I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
294624,L637994,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure."
294625,L638408,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed..."
294626,L638407,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Exception!
294627,L638406,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Overruled...
294628,L638405,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I object, your Honor..."
294629,L638398,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Mr. Concannon...?
294630,L638397,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Nothing further, your Honor..."
294631,L638155,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail."
294632,L638154,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
294633,L638153,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Are you done?
294634,L638152,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are."
294635,L638151,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Galvin, look, many years ago..."
294636,L638150,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair."
294637,L638149,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Listen to me, fella..."
294638,L638148,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me."
294639,L638147,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today."
294640,L638138,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?"
294641,L638137,u8744,m593,GALVIN,If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
294642,L638136,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Yes, Mr. Galvin?"
294643,L638128,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?"
294644,L638127,u8744,m593,GALVIN,What?
294645,L638126,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
294646,L638123,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?"
294647,L638122,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon."
294648,L638082,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Defense...?
294649,L638081,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Ready, your Honor."
294650,L638080,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Is the Plaintiff ready?
294651,L637893,u8747,m593,JUDGE,I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
294652,L637892,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I could subpoena him if I had a week.
294653,L637891,u8747,m593,JUDGE,That happens.
294654,L637890,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I had a witness disappear on me.
294655,L637889,u8747,m593,JUDGE,You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
294656,L637888,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I need an extension for my case.
294657,L637887,u8747,m593,JUDGE,That's perfectly all right.
294658,L637886,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Thank you for seeing me.
294659,L637885,u8747,m593,JUDGE,What is it?
294660,L637812,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I'm sure you would.
294661,L637811,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief."
294662,L637810,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro..."
294663,L637809,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred..."
294664,L637808,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...things change.
294665,L637807,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records."
294666,L637802,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you."
294667,L637801,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"My client can't walk, your Honor."
294668,L637800,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?"
294669,L637799,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"This is a complicated case, your Honor..."
294670,L637798,u8747,m593,JUDGE,"Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother."
294671,L637793,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I was held up.
294672,L637792,u8747,m593,JUDGE,Why is that?

294759,L637784,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'"
294760,L637783,u8749,m593,LAURA,And are they going to get it?
294761,L637782,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice."
294762,L637781,u8749,m593,LAURA,I think I will.
294763,L637780,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?"
294764,L637778,u8744,m593,GALVIN,You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
294765,L637777,u8749,m593,LAURA,What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?

294769,L637773,u8749,m593,LAURA,Who says I'm the one that called it off?
294770,L637772,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?"

294779,L637763,u8749,m593,LAURA,I changed my room at the Hotel.
294780,L637762,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I changed my life today.  What did you do?

294782,L637760,u8744,m593,GALVIN,D'you find an apartment?

294788,L637867,u8750,m593,MAID,"He's not in, Sir."
294789,L637866,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting..."
294790,L637865,u8750,m593,MAID,Dr. Gruber's not in.
294791,L637864,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Dr. Gruber.
294792,L638313,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I don't want a mistrial.

294794,L638311,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I don't know.
294795,L638310,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?"

294800,L638257,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette..."
294801,L638256,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
294802,L638255,u8752,m593,MICKEY,...four years ago...

294804,L638248,u8752,m593,MICKEY,...yeah...good...
294805,L638243,u8744,m593,GALVIN,The Hospital...?
294806,L638242,u8752,m593,MICKEY,The broad has disappeared...
294807,L638241,u8744,m593,GALVIN,We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
294808,L638228,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ..."
294809,L638227,u8752,m593,MICKEY,The 'History'...?
294810,L638226,u8744,m593,GALVIN,She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
294811,L638225,u8752,m593,MICKEY,What did she do?
294812,L638224,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Uh...the admitting nurse...
294813,L638223,u8744,m593,GALVIN,What difference can that make...? All right...
294814,L638222,u8752,m593,MICKEY,All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
294815,L638221,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
294816,L638220,u8752,m593,MICKEY,...one of the other nurses?
294817,L638219,u8744,m593,GALVIN,`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
294818,L638218,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Read me what she said.
294819,L638217,u8744,m593,GALVIN,She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
294820,L638216,u8752,m593,MICKEY,The Doctors.
294821,L638215,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
294822,L638214,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Yeah.  I'm awake.
294823,L638213,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Are you with me...are you awake...?
294824,L638206,u8752,m593,MICKEY,I think we tried that.  The case is over.
294825,L638205,u8744,m593,GALVIN,That's right.
294826,L638204,u8752,m593,MICKEY,You use their witness.
294827,L638203,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
294828,L638076,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yeah.
294829,L638075,u8752,m593,MICKEY,And all we've got is a witch doctor!
294830,L638074,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I'm swell.
294831,L638073,u8752,m593,MICKEY,How are you holding up?

294833,L637992,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to..."
294834,L637991,u8744,m593,GALVIN,D'you find the obstetric nurse?

294837,L637907,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I can't talk now.
294838,L637906,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"What happened, Joey...?"
294839,L637835,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it."
294840,L637834,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
294841,L637833,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?

294843,L637831,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Oh shit, what's today?"
294844,L637830,u8752,m593,MICKEY,John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
294845,L637829,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case."
294846,L637828,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"What I'm saying, they're getting some help."
294847,L637827,u8744,m593,GALVIN,They still have to take it to a jury.
294848,L637826,u8752,m593,MICKEY,So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
294849,L637825,u8744,m593,GALVIN,So what?
294850,L637824,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
294851,L637823,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?"
294852,L637822,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Been a long time, huh...?"
294853,L637758,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I'm going to get laid.
294854,L637757,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
294855,L637756,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow."
294856,L637755,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
294857,L637754,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"You got a good memory, Franky."
294858,L637753,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
294859,L637752,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Right.
294860,L637751,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
294861,L637750,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Right.
294862,L637749,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up."
294863,L637748,u8752,m593,MICKEY,No.
294864,L637747,u8744,m593,GALVIN,They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
294865,L637746,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'"
294866,L637745,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains..."
294867,L637744,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
294868,L637743,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Admittance form is wrong.
294869,L637742,u8752,m593,MICKEY,You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
294870,L637741,u8744,m593,GALVIN,We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
294871,L637731,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?"
294872,L637730,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back."
294873,L637729,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...I have to stand up for her...
294874,L637728,u8752,m593,MICKEY,...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
294875,L637727,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...he's a good man...
294876,L637726,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon."
294877,L637725,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'"
294878,L637724,u8752,m593,MICKEY,What?
294879,L637723,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
294880,L637722,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer..."
294881,L637721,u8744,m593,GALVIN,They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
294882,L637720,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead..."
294883,L637719,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I'm going to help her.
294884,L637718,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?"
294885,L637717,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...I'm going to need your help...
294886,L637716,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Are you out of your mind...?
294887,L637715,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Don't touch anything.
294888,L637714,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Come on.  Let's get a drink.
294889,L637713,u8752,m593,MICKEY,What do you want?
294890,L637712,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I have to talk to you.
294891,L637561,u8752,m593,MICKEY,... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
294892,L637560,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"... hey, I don't need your charity ..."
294893,L637559,u8752,m593,MICKEY,One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
294894,L637558,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Sally Doneghy, now who is that?"
294895,L637557,u8752,m593,MICKEY,... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
294896,L637556,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... now who is that ...?
294897,L637555,u8752,m593,MICKEY,Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
294898,L637554,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Uh ...

294900,L637552,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Hi, Mickey ..."
294901,L638159,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yes.
294902,L638158,u8754,m593,SALLY,"Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though..."
294903,L638157,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to..."
294904,L638156,u8754,m593,SALLY,"What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics..."
294905,L637594,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I'm going to see you get that chance.
294906,L637593,u8754,m593,SALLY,We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
294907,L637587,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ..."
294908,L637586,u8754,m593,SALLY,He saw her at the Northern Care...
294909,L637581,u8754,m593,SALLY,"... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right."
294910,L637580,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... I understand ...
294911,L637579,u8754,m593,SALLY,My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
294912,L637578,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... I understand ...
294913,L637577,u8754,m593,SALLY,"I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ..."
294914,L637576,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... fifty thousand dollars?
294915,L637575,u8754,m593,SALLY,"You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment."
294916,L637574,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Yes.  Yes, I have."
294917,L637573,u8754,m593,SALLY,... You saw her?
294918,L637572,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... I know.  I went ...
294919,L637571,u8754,m593,SALLY,But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
294920,L637570,u8744,m593,GALVIN,... I'm sure you do ...
294921,L637569,u8754,m593,SALLY,"... we, we love her, Dick and me ..."
294922,L637568,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ..."
294923,L637566,u8744,m593,GALVIN,It's locked?
294924,L637565,u8754,m593,SALLY,It's locked.
294925,L637564,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
294926,L638239,u8753,m593,ROONEY,You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
294927,L638238,u8744,m593,GALVIN,What?
294928,L638237,u8753,m593,ROONEY,In New York?
294929,L638236,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I just saw her.
294930,L638235,u8753,m593,ROONEY,She did?
294931,L638234,u8744,m593,GALVIN,She told me.
294932,L638233,u8753,m593,ROONEY,"I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said..."
294933,L638232,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"I spoke to her, and everything is all right."
294934,L638355,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294935,L638354,u8744,m593,GALVIN,A single hour.
294936,L638353,u8748,m593,KATHY,I did.
294937,L638352,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?"
294938,L638351,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294939,L638350,u8744,m593,GALVIN,One hour.
294940,L638349,u8748,m593,KATHY,She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
294941,L638348,u8744,m593,GALVIN,What did she say?
294942,L638347,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294943,L638346,u8744,m593,GALVIN,D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
294944,L638345,u8748,m593,KATHY,Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
294945,L638344,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"These are your initials, 'K.C.'?"
294946,L638343,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294947,L638341,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes.
294948,L638340,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted..."
294949,L638339,u8748,m593,KATHY,Yes...
294950,L638338,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Kathy Price...
294951,L638301,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?"
294952,L638300,u8748,m593,KATHY,I used to be a nurse.
294953,L638299,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Yes.
294954,L638298,u8748,m593,KATHY,Mrs. Simmonds.
294955,L638297,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Mrs...
294956,L638296,u8748,m593,KATHY,Who told you that?
294957,L638295,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?"
294958,L638294,u8748,m593,KATHY,Thank you.
294959,L638293,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Four.  You're great with these kids.
294960,L638292,u8748,m593,KATHY,How old is he?
294961,L638291,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by."
294962,L638290,u8748,m593,KATHY,You live in the neighborhood?
294963,L638289,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I've been meaning to come in a long time.
294964,L638288,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Hi.  How are you doing?
294965,L638287,u8748,m593,KATHY,Hi.
294966,L637685,u8746,m593,JIMMY,"That's for sure, Frank."
294967,L637684,u8744,m593,GALVIN,It's a long road that has no turning.
294968,L637683,u8746,m593,JIMMY,Yeah.
294969,L637682,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Well, well, well.  Huh?"
294970,L637674,u8746,m593,JIMMY,"Thanks, Franky."
294971,L637673,u8744,m593,GALVIN,I want to buy you a drink.
294972,L637550,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too."
294973,L637549,u8746,m593,JIMMY,"Another, Frank . . . ?"
294974,L638189,u8755,m593,TOWLER,Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
294975,L638188,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Huh.  And why is that?
294976,L638187,u8755,m593,TOWLER,Yes.
294977,L638186,u8744,m593,GALVIN,"Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?"
294978,L638185,u8755,m593,TOWLER,"Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two..."
294979,L638179,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
294980,L638178,u8755,m593,TOWLER,"We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro..."
294981,L638177,u8744,m593,GALVIN,What happened in those three minutes...?
294982,L638176,u8755,m593,TOWLER,...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
294983,L638175,u8744,m593,GALVIN,What happened in those three...
294984,L638174,u8755,m593,TOWLER,We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
294985,L638173,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...they start again three minutes earlier...
294986,L638172,u8755,m593,TOWLER,As I've said we had some more...
294987,L638171,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
294988,L638170,u8755,m593,TOWLER,"We, we were rather busy..."
294989,L638169,u8744,m593,GALVIN,But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
294990,L638168,u8755,m593,TOWLER,"Yes, the roving nurse..."
294991,L638167,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...of the procedures...
294992,L638166,u8755,m593,TOWLER,Yes.
294993,L638165,u8744,m593,GALVIN,...there are notations every thirty seconds...
294994,L638164,u8755,m593,TOWLER,"Yes, that's correct."
294995,L638163,u8744,m593,GALVIN,You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
294996,L638162,u8755,m593,TOWLER,Yes.
294997,L638161,u8744,m593,GALVIN,Dr. Towler...
294998,L637883,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?"
294999,L637882,u8749,m593,LAURA,"Me, too."
295000,L637881,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?"
295001,L637880,u8749,m593,LAURA,Huh.
295002,L637879,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out."
295003,L637878,u8749,m593,LAURA,The Big Boy did...?
295004,L637877,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case."
295005,L637876,u8749,m593,LAURA,Yes.
295006,L637875,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?"
295007,L637874,u8749,m593,LAURA,Should I?
295008,L637873,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?"
295009,L637857,u8752,m593,MICKEY,So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
295010,L637856,u8749,m593,LAURA,How'm I doing so far?
295011,L637855,u8752,m593,MICKEY,"Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other."
295012,L639008,u8764,m594,MIDGE,I'll give you another complication: he still is.
295013,L639007,u8758,m594,DOCTOR,Ah? That complicates the problem.
295014,L639006,u8764,m594,MIDGE,I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
295015,L639005,u8758,m594,DOCTOR,"No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background."
295016,L639004,u8764,m594,MIDGE,He won't talk.
295017,L639003,u8758,m594,DOCTOR,"It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him."
295018,L639002,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?"
295019,L638990,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go..."
295020,L638989,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I -- I --
295021,L638988,u8759,m594,ELSTER,He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
295022,L638659,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely."
295023,L638658,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Why did she never tell her daughter?
295024,L638657,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here."
295025,L638656,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
295026,L638655,u8759,m594,ELSTER,She is not my wife.
295027,L638654,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,And when she goes to those places...
295028,L638653,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Nothing.
295029,L638652,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?"
295030,L638651,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes."
295031,L638650,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that."
295032,L638649,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
295033,L638648,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
295034,L638647,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again."
295035,L638646,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair."
295036,L638645,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,But you knew about this.
295037,L638644,u8759,m594,ELSTER,I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
295038,L638643,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,There are things you didn't tell me.
295039,L638642,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Yes.
295040,L638641,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,That's Carlotta Valdes.
295041,L638640,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job."
295042,L638553,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal..."
295043,L638552,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Ernie's.
295044,L638551,u8759,m594,ELSTER,We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
295045,L638550,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"How can I see her, to know her?"
295046,L638549,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!"
295047,L638548,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,It's not my line.
295048,L638547,u8759,m594,ELSTER,I want you.
295049,L638546,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --"
295050,L638545,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --"
295051,L638544,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Have you talked to the doctors at all?
295052,L638543,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors."
295053,L638542,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Well?
295054,L638541,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all."
295055,L638540,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where'd she go?
295056,L638539,u8759,m594,ELSTER,More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
295057,L638538,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How often does this happen?
295058,L638537,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why..."
295059,L638536,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No.
295060,L638535,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?"
295061,L638534,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I didn't mean to be that rough.
295062,L638533,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie."
295063,L638532,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both."
295064,L638531,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?"
295065,L638530,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No.
295066,L638529,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?"
295067,L638528,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Someone dead.
295068,L638527,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,From whom?
295069,L638526,u8759,m594,ELSTER,I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
295070,L638525,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Then?
295071,L638524,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Not what you think. We're very happily married.
295072,L638521,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the ""old college gang""; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?"
295073,L638520,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Would you like a drink now?
295074,L638519,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town."
295075,L638518,u8759,m594,ELSTER,I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
295076,L638517,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, I'm all right."
295077,L638516,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Shouldn't you be sitting down?
295078,L638515,u8759,m594,ELSTER,I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
295079,L638514,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Like all this.
295080,L638513,u8759,m594,ELSTER,San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
295081,L638512,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,And you like it.
295082,L638511,u8759,m594,ELSTER,Almost a year.
295083,L638510,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How long have you been back?
295084,L638509,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here."
295085,L638508,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You don't have to do it for a living.
295086,L638507,u8759,m594,ELSTER,"No, to be honest, I find it dull."
295087,L638506,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Interesting business.
295088,L638505,u8759,m594,ELSTER,I married into it.
295089,L638504,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?"
295090,L638735,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
295091,L638734,u8760,m594,ELSTER'S VOICE,Did she hurt herself?
295092,L638733,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Hello?
295093,L638732,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,She... went into the Bay.
295094,L638731,u8760,m594,ELSTER'S VOICE,What happened?
295095,L638730,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon."
295096,L638729,u8760,m594,ELSTER'S VOICE,"Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet."
295097,L638728,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Hello.
295098,L639285,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
295099,L639284,u8761,m594,JUDY,Love me... keep me safe...
295100,L639283,u8761,m594,JUDY,"I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!"
295101,L639282,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I loved you, Madeleine."
295102,L639281,u8761,m594,JUDY,What are you going to do?
295103,L639280,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental."
295104,L639279,u8761,m594,JUDY,Some money.
295105,L639278,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?"
295106,L639274,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
295107,L639273,u8761,m594,JUDY,What are you going to do?
295108,L639272,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I made it.
295109,L639271,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,We'll find him.
295110,L639270,u8761,m594,JUDY,I don't know... Switzerland?
295111,L639269,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?"
295112,L639268,u8761,m594,JUDY,Your accident...
295113,L639267,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!"
295114,L639266,u8761,m594,JUDY,Yes!
295115,L639265,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
295116,L639264,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!"
295117,L639263,u8761,m594,JUDY,"I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --"
295118,L639262,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?"
295119,L639261,u8761,m594,JUDY,Dead. He'd broken her neck.
295120,L639260,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?"
295121,L639259,u8761,m594,JUDY,Yes!
295122,L639258,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?"
295123,L639257,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Scottie, please...!"
295124,L639256,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'm going to. It's my second chance.
295125,L639255,u8761,m594,JUDY,You can't. You're afraid!
295126,L639254,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,We're going up the tower.
295127,L639253,u8761,m594,JUDY,No! Let me go!
295128,L639252,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"We're going up the tower, Madeleine."
295129,L639249,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow."
295130,L639248,u8761,m594,JUDY,No!
295131,L639247,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs."
295132,L639246,u8761,m594,JUDY,Take me away...
295133,L639245,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy."
295134,L639238,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"-- and wanted to go on loving you."" And I said, ""I won't lose you.""  But I did."
295135,L639237,u8761,m594,JUDY,Scottie --
295136,L639236,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, ""If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --"
295137,L639234,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now."
295138,L639233,u8761,m594,JUDY,I'm scared.
295139,L639232,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free."
295140,L639231,u8761,m594,JUDY,Why?
295141,L639230,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I need you.
295142,L639229,u8761,m594,JUDY,"No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here."
295143,L639228,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Madeleine died here.
295144,L639227,u8761,m594,JUDY,But why? Why here?
295145,L639226,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
295146,L639225,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Scottie, why are we here?"
295147,L639223,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,To complete my cure.
295148,L639222,u8761,m594,JUDY,Where are you going?
295149,L639221,u8761,m594,JUDY,"No, it's all right."
295150,L639220,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
295151,L639219,u8761,m594,JUDY,We're going awfully far.
295152,L639213,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Oh, yeah. There."
295153,L639212,u8761,m594,JUDY,Can't you see?
295154,L639211,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How does it work?
295155,L639210,u8761,m594,JUDY,Scottie!
295156,L639209,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,All in good time.
295157,L639208,u8761,m594,JUDY,Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
295158,L639207,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
295159,L639205,u8761,m594,JUDY,I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
295160,L639204,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, Ernie's is fine."
295161,L639203,u8761,m594,JUDY,I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
295162,L639202,u8761,m594,JUDY,Too late. I've got my face on.
295163,L639201,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,That's what I had in mind.
295164,L639200,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Oh, no. You'll muss me."
295165,L639199,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Come here.
295166,L639198,u8761,m594,JUDY,Is that the best you can do?
295167,L639197,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Mmmm.
295168,L639195,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Well, after all, it's ""our place."""
295169,L639194,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?"
295170,L639193,u8761,m594,JUDY,Ernie's?
295171,L639192,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Wherever you'd like...
295172,L639191,u8761,m594,JUDY,Where shall we go for dinner?
295173,L639188,u8761,m594,JUDY,We tried it. It didn't suit me.
295174,L639187,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
295175,L639186,u8761,m594,JUDY,Well?
295176,L639177,u8761,m594,JUDY,All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
295177,L639176,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yes.
295178,L639175,u8761,m594,JUDY,"The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?"
295179,L639174,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Judy, please it can't matter to you..."
295180,L639173,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Ah, no!"
295181,L639172,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,The color of your hair...
295182,L639170,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Yes. Yes, I do."
295183,L639169,u8761,m594,JUDY,You don't even want to touch me.
295184,L639168,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you."
295185,L639167,u8761,m594,JUDY,"I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much."
295186,L639166,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year."
295187,L639165,u8761,m594,JUDY,"No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go..."
295188,L639164,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You can.
295189,L639163,u8761,m594,JUDY,I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
295190,L639147,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,We'll take it! Will it fit?
295191,L639146,u8761,m594,JUDY,I don't like it!
295192,L639143,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!"
295193,L639142,u8761,m594,JUDY,"No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!"
295194,L639141,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --"
295195,L639136,u8761,m594,JUDY,It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
295196,L639135,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Judy --
295197,L639134,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!"
295198,L639133,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you."
295199,L639132,u8761,m594,JUDY,You want me to dress like her?
295200,L639129,u8761,m594,JUDY,But why?
295201,L639128,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,They're none of them right.
295202,L639127,u8761,m594,JUDY,But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
295203,L639126,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'm trying to buy you a suit.
295204,L639125,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Scottie, what are you doing?"
295205,L639123,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, it's not right."
295206,L639122,u8761,m594,JUDY,"But I like that one, Scottie."
295207,L639118,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I want to! Come on!
295208,L639117,u8761,m594,JUDY,"But Scottie, you don't have to!"
295209,L639116,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
295210,L639115,u8761,m594,JUDY,Honest?
295211,L639114,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
295212,L639109,u8761,m594,JUDY,Yes --
295213,L639108,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?"
295214,L639107,u8761,m594,JUDY,I like that one.
295215,L639105,u8761,m594,JUDY,"I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick."
295216,L639104,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Will you, Judy?"
295217,L639103,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Please! And don't look at me.
295218,L639102,u8761,m594,JUDY,Why?!
295219,L639101,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!"
295220,L639099,u8761,m594,JUDY,"That's not very complimentary, either."
295221,L639098,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No.
295222,L639097,u8761,m594,JUDY,Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
295223,L639096,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yes.
295224,L639095,u8761,m594,JUDY,"As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd ""take care of me""?"
295225,L639094,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I just want to see you as much as I can!
295226,L639093,u8761,m594,JUDY,No? Then what?
295227,L639092,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No.
295228,L639091,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night."
295229,L639090,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, Judy, you don't understand."
295230,L639089,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks."
295231,L639088,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'll take care of you.
295232,L639087,u8761,m594,JUDY,And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
295233,L639086,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Don't go.
295234,L639085,u8761,m594,JUDY,Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
295235,L639084,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Tomorrow morning.
295236,L639083,u8761,m594,JUDY,Tomorrow night? Well --
295237,L639082,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Can I see you tomorrow?
295238,L639081,u8761,m594,JUDY,Thank you again. Good-night.
295239,L639078,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Okay.
295240,L639077,u8761,m594,JUDY,Mmm.
295241,L639076,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,An hour?
295242,L639075,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!"
295243,L639074,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
295244,L639073,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay."
295245,L639072,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
295246,L639071,u8761,m594,JUDY,Because I remind you of her?
295247,L639070,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Just dinner.
295248,L639069,u8761,m594,JUDY,Dinner... and what else?
295249,L639068,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Then will you for me?
295250,L639067,u8761,m594,JUDY,"No, you don't owe me anything."
295251,L639066,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Well, I feel I owe you something for all this..."
295252,L639065,u8761,m594,JUDY,Why?
295253,L639064,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Will you have dinner with me?
295254,L639056,u8761,m594,JUDY,"I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?"
295255,L639055,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I want to know who you are.
295256,L639054,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Listen, what is this? What do you want?"
295257,L639053,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Salina, Kansas!"
295258,L639052,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,But before! Where did you live before!?!
295259,L639051,u8761,m594,JUDY,I told you! Right here!
295260,L639050,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?"
295261,L639049,u8761,m594,JUDY,About three years.
295262,L639048,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,But you haven't lived here long.
295263,L639047,u8761,m594,JUDY,"It's a place to live, that's all."
295264,L639046,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,-- and how you happen to be living here.
295265,L639045,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --"
295266,L639044,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Who you are --
295267,L639043,u8761,m594,JUDY,Judy Barton.
295268,L639042,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Your name. And --
295269,L639041,u8761,m594,JUDY,What do you want to know?
295270,L639040,u8761,m594,JUDY,Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
295271,L639039,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You won't have to.
295272,L639038,u8761,m594,JUDY,"I warn you, I can yell awfully loud."
295273,L639036,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Let me come in.
295274,L639035,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go."
295275,L639034,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You're not far wrong.
295276,L639033,u8761,m594,JUDY,"I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!"
295277,L639031,u8761,m594,JUDY,Why?
295278,L639030,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You.
295279,L639029,u8761,m594,JUDY,What about?
295280,L639028,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Just let me talk to you.
295281,L639027,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
295282,L639026,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!"
295283,L639025,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, please! I Just want to talk to you!"
295284,L639024,u8761,m594,JUDY,"0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!"
295285,L639023,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --"
295286,L639022,u8761,m594,JUDY,Do you live here in the hotel?
295287,L639021,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --"
295288,L639020,u8761,m594,JUDY,"Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?"
295289,L639019,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"My name is John Ferguson, and --"
295290,L639018,u8761,m594,JUDY,What for? Who are you?
295291,L639017,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Could I ask you a couple of questions?
295292,L638975,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run."
295293,L638974,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Why?
295294,L638973,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Let me go into the church alone.
295295,L638972,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I won't lose you.
295296,L638971,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you."
295297,L638970,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yes.
295298,L638969,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,You believe that I love you?
295299,L638968,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Madeleine!!
295300,L638967,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Let me go! Let me go!!
295301,L638966,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
295302,L638965,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!"
295303,L638963,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Please let me go.
295304,L638962,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Madeleine --
295305,L638961,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"To the church, I must go there."
295306,L638960,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where?
295307,L638959,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Let me go.
295308,L638958,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Why?
295309,L638957,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,You can't.
295310,L638956,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe."
295311,L638953,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Too late... there's something I must do...
295312,L638952,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No... we're together...
295313,L638951,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I love you too... too late... too late...
295314,L638950,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,My love... because I love you.
295315,L638944,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!"
295316,L638943,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Yes.
295317,L638942,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,And it's a all real.
295318,L638941,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Here with you.
295319,L638933,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up..."
295320,L638932,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
295321,L638928,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!"
295322,L638927,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!"
295323,L638926,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, never!"
295324,L638925,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You've been there before. You've seen it.
295325,L638924,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,It's all there. It's no dream.
295326,L638923,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Yes?! But --
295327,L638922,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps."
295328,L638921,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
295329,L638920,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Go on.
295330,L638919,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside."
295331,L638918,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Tell me.
295332,L638917,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
295333,L638916,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yes --
295334,L638915,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village..."
295335,L638914,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?"
295336,L638912,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
295337,L638911,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where's your husband?
295338,L638909,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Only this far.
295339,L638908,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, don't go away!"
295340,L638906,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I had the dream. The dream came back again...
295341,L638905,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Why? What's happened?
295342,L638904,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
295343,L638863,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,All the time.
295344,L638862,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Don't leave me... stay with me...
295345,L638861,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
295346,L638860,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I'm here, I've got you..."
295347,L638859,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!"
295348,L638857,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?"
295349,L638856,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
295350,L638855,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No!
295351,L638854,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,But I'm the woman in the mirror!
295352,L638853,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
295353,L638852,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No.
295354,L638851,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
295355,L638850,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone."
295356,L638849,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What else?
295357,L638848,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No. It's new and clean, and waiting."
295358,L638847,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,There's a name on the gravestone.
295359,L638846,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I know.
295360,L638845,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How do you know?
295361,L638844,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
295362,L638843,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where?
295363,L638842,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,A grave...
295364,L638841,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What else?
295365,L638840,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No... it's in shadow.
295366,L638839,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Would you know the room?
295367,L638838,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone..."
295368,L638837,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What do you remember?
295369,L638836,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Vaguely...
295370,L638835,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them."
295371,L638832,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yesterday.
295372,L638831,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once."
295373,L638830,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
295374,L638829,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know."
295375,L638826,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,...somewhere in the light.
295376,L638825,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Home?
295377,L638824,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Take me away from here?
295378,L638823,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!"
295379,L638822,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What?!
295380,L638821,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, I can't tell you!"
295381,L638820,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What was it inside that told you to jump?
295382,L638819,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No!
295383,L638818,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Why did you jump?
295384,L638817,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!"
295385,L638816,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know."
295386,L638815,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, don't ask me!"
295387,L638814,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
295388,L638813,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No!... No!
295389,L638809,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where?
295390,L638808,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Long ago...
295391,L638807,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where were you born?
295392,L638806,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,When?
295393,L638805,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Yes...
295394,L638804,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Have you been here before?
295395,L638803,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,The tall trees...
295396,L638802,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where?
295397,L638801,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Here with you.
295398,L638800,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where are you now?
295399,L638798,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Madeleine!
295400,L638797,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
295401,L638796,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, thank you."
295402,L638795,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Would you like a drink of water?
295403,L638794,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No.
295404,L638793,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No birds live here.
295405,L638792,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,And no birds sing.
295406,L638791,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Only silence. It's always like this.
295407,L638790,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Do you hear anything?
295408,L638787,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Knowing I have to die...
295409,L638786,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Why?
295410,L638785,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I don't like them.
295411,L638784,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living."
295412,L638783,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
295413,L638782,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What are you thinking?
295414,L638780,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,The oldest living things?
295415,L638779,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Oh... some, two thousand years, or more."
295416,L638778,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,How old?
295417,L638777,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
295418,L638776,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How can you be sure?
295419,L638775,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
295420,L638774,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Do you know where you're going?
295421,L638771,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true."
295422,L638770,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere."
295423,L638769,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
295424,L638768,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?"
295425,L638767,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
295426,L638766,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, I Just thought I'd wander."
295427,L638765,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Well... anywhere in particular?
295428,L638764,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No.
295429,L638763,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Shopping?
295430,L638762,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I don't know.
295431,L638760,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Good-bye.
295432,L638759,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Good-bye.
295433,L638758,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,We have.
295434,L638757,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Meet again, sometime."
295435,L638756,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,What?
295436,L638755,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I hope we will, too."
295437,L638754,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
295438,L638753,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
295439,L638752,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No! No, thank you!"
295440,L638751,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Would you like some coffee?
295441,L638749,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I enjoyed talking to you.
295442,L638748,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,-- talking to you...
295443,L638747,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Not at all, I enjoyed --"
295444,L638746,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!"
295445,L638745,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You've nothing to apologize for.
295446,L638744,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology."
295447,L638743,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
295448,L638742,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I... suddenly felt such a fool.
295449,L638741,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that."
295450,L638740,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Oh! Yes. Hello.
295451,L638726,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No... this is the first time for me, too."
295452,L638725,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?"
295453,L638724,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
295454,L638723,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,What?
295455,L638722,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
295456,L638720,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No... it's wrong.
295457,L638719,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Some people prefer it.
295458,L638718,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,One shouldn't live alone.
295459,L638717,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
295460,L638716,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Wander about.
295461,L638715,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?"
295462,L638714,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John."
295463,L638713,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
295464,L638712,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
295465,L638711,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack."
295466,L638710,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,My name is John Ferguson.
295467,L638709,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster."
295468,L638708,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way."
295469,L638707,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?"
295470,L638706,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I... didn't know where you lived.
295471,L638705,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"You shouldn't have brought me here, you know."
295472,L638703,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Oh! Yes! Here!
295473,L638702,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,When you...  There were pins in my hair...
295474,L638701,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,No.
295475,L638700,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
295476,L638699,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past."
295477,L638698,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
295478,L638696,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"You like it, too."
295479,L638695,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Wandering about.
295480,L638694,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
295481,L638693,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
295482,L638692,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
295483,L638691,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Please drink your coffee.
295484,L638689,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
295485,L638688,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Oh... wandering about.
295486,L638687,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,This afternoon.
295487,L638686,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,When?
295488,L638685,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where had you been before?
295489,L638684,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
295490,L638683,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Why?
295491,L638682,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
295492,L638681,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,At...
295493,L638680,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Where were you?
295494,L638679,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,"Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!"
295495,L638678,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Do you remember where you were?
295496,L638677,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,No...
295497,L638676,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You don't remember.
295498,L638668,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,You...  ...fell into the Bay.
295499,L638667,u8762,m594,MADELEINE,Why am I here? What happened?
295500,L638585,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,What car?
295501,L638584,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Her car is gone.
295502,L638582,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly..."
295503,L638581,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Would you please go and look?
295504,L638580,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
295505,L638579,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!"
295506,L638578,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
295507,L638577,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her."
295508,L638576,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"When she comes down, don't say that I've been here."
295509,L638575,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --"
295510,L638574,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Does she sleep here? Ever?
295511,L638573,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow."
295512,L638572,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How long has she had the room?
295513,L638571,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet."
295514,L638570,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Carlotta Valdes?
295515,L638569,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know."
295516,L638568,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What is her name?
295517,L638567,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
295518,L638566,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Please answer my question.
295519,L638565,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?"
295520,L638564,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --"
295521,L638563,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?"
295522,L638562,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,"Oh, yes!"
295523,L638561,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yes... you run this hotel.
295524,L638560,u8763,m594,MANAGERESS,Is there something I can do for you?
295525,L638894,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Oh?
295526,L638893,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you."
295527,L638892,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"No, not exactly. Want to see?"
295528,L638891,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"What is it, a still life?"
295529,L638890,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this."
295530,L638889,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
295531,L638888,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting."
295532,L638886,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Wandering.
295533,L638885,u8764,m594,MIDGE,What have you been doing?
295534,L638884,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Naturally.
295535,L638883,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about."
295536,L638882,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What I've been doing?
295537,L638881,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Oh... this and that.
295538,L638880,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
295539,L638879,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie."
295540,L638878,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Well, I detected an undercurrent."
295541,L638877,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"All I said in the note was: ""Where are you?"" That doesn't sound desperate to me."
295542,L638876,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What was this desperate urge to see me?
295543,L638875,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Oh?
295544,L638874,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yeah.
295545,L638873,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Did you need it?
295546,L638872,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Mm. Better.
295547,L638871,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Oh?
295548,L638870,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Around.
295549,L638869,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Where?
295550,L638868,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Just wander.
295551,L638867,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?"
295552,L638866,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
295553,L638639,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Bye-bye!
295554,L638638,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Midge!
295555,L638636,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Mmm, yeah, I guess..."
295556,L638635,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife."
295557,L638634,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Carlotta?
295558,L638633,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Is she pretty?
295559,L638632,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Think?  Well, what do you think?"
295560,L638631,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
295561,L638630,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!"
295562,L638629,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Out!
295563,L638628,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster."
295564,L638627,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Out. I've got things to do.
295565,L638626,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Who's the guy, who's the wife?"
295566,L638625,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I've told you enough.
295567,L638624,u8764,m594,MIDGE,You haven't told me everything.
295568,L638623,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Here you are.
295569,L638621,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'll take you home.
295570,L638620,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!"
295571,L638619,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Nothing to tell.
295572,L638618,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"For bringing you here. Come on, tell!"
295573,L638617,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,For what?
295574,L638616,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Now then, Johnny-O; pay me."
295575,L638610,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,And she died...
295576,L638609,u8764,m594,MIDGE,The poor thing....
295577,L638600,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?"
295578,L638599,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Pop Leibel? Sure.
295579,L638598,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Do you know him well?
295580,L638597,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
295581,L638596,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879."
295582,L638595,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
295583,L638594,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Who?
295584,L638593,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Pop Leibel.
295585,L638592,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yeah.
295586,L638591,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?"
295587,L638590,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
295588,L638589,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley."
295589,L638588,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Well, who? Come on, you know everybody."
295590,L638587,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this ""hello you look wonderful"" stuff. Just a good straight ""who do you know"" --"
295591,L638503,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --"
295592,L638502,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Johnny!
295593,L638501,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --"
295594,L638500,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Easy, now."
295595,L638498,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Okay.
295596,L638497,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Step number two.
295597,L638495,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
295598,L638494,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it."
295599,L638493,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
295600,L638492,u8764,m594,MIDGE,That!?!
295601,L638491,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this."
295602,L638490,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
295603,L638489,u8764,m594,MIDGE,How?
295604,L638488,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I think I can lick it.
295605,L638487,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out."
295606,L638486,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,My... the acrophobia.
295607,L638485,u8764,m594,MIDGE,What.
295608,L638484,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?"
295609,L638483,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Sorry, old man. Work."
295610,L638482,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight."
295611,L638481,u8764,m594,MIDGE,He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
295612,L638480,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Could be.
295613,L638479,u8764,m594,MIDGE,That's Skid Row... isn't it?
295614,L638478,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number."
295615,L638477,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
295616,L638476,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?"
295617,L638475,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Three whole weeks.
295618,L638474,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?"
295619,L638473,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O."
295620,L638472,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Aren't you ever going to get married?
295621,L638471,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Normal.
295622,L638470,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Well?
295623,L638469,u8764,m594,MIDGE,That's following a train of thought.
295624,L638468,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"How's your love life, Midge?"
295625,L638467,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What a pleasant hobby.
295626,L638466,u8764,m594,MIDGE,An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
295627,L638465,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Uh-huh!
295628,L638464,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge."
295629,L638463,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I've never run across one like that.
295630,L638462,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now."
295631,L638460,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Oh!
295632,L638459,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,From that music.
295633,L638458,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I'm having one now.
295634,L638457,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
295635,L638456,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up."
295636,L638455,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
295637,L638454,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent."
295638,L638453,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Well?... what'll you do?
295639,L638452,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Ah, Johnny-O..."
295640,L638451,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!"
295641,L638450,u8764,m594,MIDGE,It's where you belong.
295642,L638449,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
295643,L638448,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?"
295644,L638447,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
295645,L638446,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"Johnny, the doctors explained --"
295646,L638445,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I know. Everybody tells me.
295647,L638444,u8764,m594,MIDGE,It wasn't your fault.
295648,L638443,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
295649,L638442,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Why?
295650,L638441,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"I had to quit, Midge."
295651,L638440,u8764,m594,MIDGE,"No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day."
295652,L638439,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"You sound so disapproving, Midge."
295653,L638438,u8764,m594,MIDGE,What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
295654,L638437,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What do you mean?
295655,L638436,u8764,m594,MIDGE,Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
295656,L638435,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How do you know? Personal experience?
295657,L638434,u8764,m594,MIDGE,More than you think.
295658,L638433,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?"
295659,L638432,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
295660,L638431,u8764,m594,MIDGE,What's tomorrow?
295661,L638430,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!"
295662,L638429,u8764,m594,MIDGE,No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
295663,L638428,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
295664,L638427,u8764,m594,MIDGE,I thought you said no more aches and pains?
295665,L638426,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Ow!!
295666,L638614,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much."
295667,L638613,u8765,m594,POP LEIBEL,By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
295668,L638612,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How?
295669,L638611,u8765,m594,POP LEIBEL,She died.
295670,L638607,u8765,m594,POP LEIBEL,"By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child."
295671,L638606,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,By whom?
295672,L638605,u8765,m594,POP LEIBEL,It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
295673,L638604,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
295674,L638603,u8765,m594,POP LEIBEL,Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
295675,L639153,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out."
295676,L639152,u8766,m594,SALESWOMAN,"Well, if it's absolutely necessary..."
295677,L639151,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Can we have it by tonight?
295678,L639150,u8766,m594,SALESWOMAN,Well...
295679,L639149,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,How soon can it be altered?
295680,L639148,u8766,m594,SALESWOMAN,"Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment."
295681,L639145,u8766,m594,SALESWOMAN,I thought so!
295682,L639144,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,Yes! That's it!
295683,L639138,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --"
295684,L639137,u8766,m594,SALESWOMAN,She'll be out in a moment.
295685,L639121,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted."
295686,L639120,u8766,m594,SALESWOMAN,"But you said grey, sir."
295687,L639119,u8767,m594,SCOTTIE,"No, that's not it. Nothing like it."
295688,L640983,u8768,m595,ADAM,We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
295689,L640982,u8777,m595,MOORE,Can't do what?
295690,L640721,u8768,m595,ADAM,"That's a horrible ugly comment. ""Dead whore?"" She's a person!"
295691,L640720,u8777,m595,MOORE,I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
295692,L640716,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident..."
295693,L640715,u8777,m595,MOORE,They'll get us on accesory to murder.
295694,L640642,u8768,m595,ADAM,Don't touch her. Call 911.
295695,L640641,u8777,m595,MOORE,Jesus.
295696,L640632,u8768,m595,ADAM,I need a drink.
295697,L640631,u8777,m595,MOORE,She's fucking hot!
295698,L640619,u8768,m595,ADAM,Excellent.
295699,L640618,u8777,m595,MOORE,The stripper's here.
295700,L640938,u8780,m595,SUIT,Well that's what I said.
295701,L640937,u8768,m595,ADAM,I didn't hear you.
295702,L640936,u8780,m595,SUIT,I said how's it going?
295703,L640935,u8768,m595,ADAM,What did you say?
295704,L640934,u8780,m595,SUIT,What's that?
295705,L640933,u8768,m595,ADAM,What?
295706,L640932,u8780,m595,SUIT,How ya doing?
295707,L641029,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You go home!
295708,L641028,u8768,m595,ADAM,Go home!
295709,L641027,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
295710,L641026,u8768,m595,ADAM,Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
295711,L641019,u8768,m595,ADAM,You fucking bastard!
295712,L641018,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
295713,L641007,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You're a loser.
295714,L641006,u8768,m595,ADAM,"If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry."
295715,L641004,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Eat my ass!
295716,L641003,u8768,m595,ADAM,And you're a little fucking reject.
295717,L641002,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,About anybody but yourself. You never have.
295718,L640899,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
295719,L640898,u8768,m595,ADAM,Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
295720,L640828,u8768,m595,ADAM,What are you fucking talking about?
295721,L640827,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
295722,L640826,u8768,m595,ADAM,The hell I don't.
295723,L640825,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,The hell you do.
295724,L640824,u8768,m595,ADAM,I have plenty of friends.
295725,L640823,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
295726,L640822,u8768,m595,ADAM,Don't point at me.
295727,L640821,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You're not a team player.
295728,L640820,u8768,m595,ADAM,What did you say?
295729,L640819,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You're pathetic.
295730,L640818,u8768,m595,ADAM,This is pathetic.
295731,L640789,u8768,m595,ADAM,It's sacrilegious.
295732,L640788,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Why?
295733,L640684,u8768,m595,ADAM,Why?!
295734,L640683,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I don't know why the floor was wet!
295735,L640682,u8768,m595,ADAM,Why was the floor wet?
295736,L640681,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,The floor was wet. She slipped!
295737,L640654,u8768,m595,ADAM,Playing?
295738,L640653,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
295739,L640644,u8768,m595,ADAM,She's dead.
295740,L640643,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
295741,L640559,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Franco mother-fucking Harris!
295742,L640558,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway..."
295743,L640517,u8768,m595,ADAM,I don't have to...
295744,L640516,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Name one.
295745,L640515,u8768,m595,ADAM,Multiple reasons.
295746,L640514,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Oh, and why am I an asshole?"
295747,L640513,u8768,m595,ADAM,You're an asshole.
295748,L640512,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You're an asshole Adam.
295749,L640504,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
295750,L640503,u8768,m595,ADAM,"No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me."
295751,L640502,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?"
295752,L640501,u8768,m595,ADAM,It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
295753,L640452,u8768,m595,ADAM,Sorry Fish.
295754,L640451,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You're interrupting a personal conversation.
295755,L640450,u8768,m595,ADAM,No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
295756,L640449,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,First of all...
295757,L640448,u8768,m595,ADAM,"We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then."
295758,L641034,u8768,m595,ADAM,No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
295759,L641033,u8770,m595,BOYD,All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
295760,L641017,u8768,m595,ADAM,I got children. I've got a life.
295761,L641016,u8770,m595,BOYD,They won't figure it out.
295762,L641015,u8768,m595,ADAM,"I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out."
295763,L641014,u8770,m595,BOYD,It has worked.
295764,L641013,u8768,m595,ADAM,I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
295765,L641012,u8770,m595,BOYD,Adam! Calm down.
295766,L641011,u8768,m595,ADAM,I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
295767,L641001,u8768,m595,ADAM,I don't give a damn.
295768,L641000,u8770,m595,BOYD,You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
295769,L640988,u8770,m595,BOYD,Nobody's smoking anybody out.
295770,L640987,u8768,m595,ADAM,They're on me. They're smoking me out!
295771,L640986,u8770,m595,BOYD,Who? What are you talking about?
295772,L640985,u8768,m595,ADAM,At the seven-eleven.
295773,L640984,u8770,m595,BOYD,What?
295774,L640981,u8768,m595,ADAM,I can't do this.
295775,L640980,u8770,m595,BOYD,What is your problem?
295776,L640912,u8770,m595,BOYD,Any time fat boy!
295777,L640911,u8768,m595,ADAM,Fuck you Boyd!
295778,L640910,u8770,m595,BOYD,Watch the tone fella.
295779,L640909,u8768,m595,ADAM,Don't talk to me about character.
295780,L640908,u8770,m595,BOYD,Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
295781,L640907,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!"
295782,L640906,u8770,m595,BOYD,Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
295783,L640905,u8768,m595,ADAM,You got us into this mess.
295784,L640904,u8770,m595,BOYD,What does that mean?
295785,L640903,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!"
295786,L640807,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less."
295787,L640806,u8768,m595,ADAM,"We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first."
295788,L640805,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud."
295789,L640802,u8770,m595,BOYD,Alright. Let's do it.
295790,L640801,u8768,m595,ADAM,I am not flexible on this.
295791,L640800,u8770,m595,BOYD,We have to get going.
295792,L640797,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs."
295793,L640796,u8770,m595,BOYD,Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
295794,L640795,u8768,m595,ADAM,That is absolutely not true.
295795,L640794,u8770,m595,BOYD,She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
295796,L640793,u8768,m595,ADAM,No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
295797,L640792,u8770,m595,BOYD,So that's what we're doing.
295798,L640791,u8768,m595,ADAM,"According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace."
295799,L640790,u8770,m595,BOYD,How do you figure?
295800,L640787,u8768,m595,ADAM,"No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases."
295801,L640786,u8770,m595,BOYD,We've already done this.
295802,L640785,u8768,m595,ADAM,We can't do this.
295803,L640784,u8770,m595,BOYD,What?
295804,L640783,u8768,m595,ADAM,Wait. Wait a minute.
295805,L640782,u8768,m595,ADAM,I'm not wrecking the transmission!
295806,L640781,u8770,m595,BOYD,Sun rises at 5:52.
295807,L640738,u8770,m595,BOYD,"The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this."
295808,L640737,u8768,m595,ADAM,Have you ever done this before?
295809,L640736,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works."
295810,L640735,u8768,m595,ADAM,What about the blood?
295811,L640734,u8770,m595,BOYD,We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
295812,L640733,u8768,m595,ADAM,You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
295813,L640732,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done."
295814,L640719,u8770,m595,BOYD,"She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down."
295815,L640718,u8768,m595,ADAM,So I didn't fucking do it!
295816,L640717,u8770,m595,BOYD,Her fucking head was caved in.
295817,L640712,u8770,m595,BOYD,"It's a marble floor, we can clean it up."
295818,L640711,u8768,m595,ADAM,Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
295819,L640708,u8770,m595,BOYD,Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
295820,L640707,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?"
295821,L640706,u8770,m595,BOYD,We can do this. We can get her out of here.
295822,L640705,u8768,m595,ADAM,You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
295823,L640702,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Sure, why not."
295824,L640701,u8770,m595,BOYD,Bury her out in the desert.
295825,L640698,u8770,m595,BOYD,"What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal..."
295826,L640697,u8768,m595,ADAM,I'm calling the police.
295827,L640696,u8770,m595,BOYD,Just giving the facts.
295828,L640695,u8768,m595,ADAM,Just stop.
295829,L640694,u8770,m595,BOYD,There's more.
295830,L640693,u8768,m595,ADAM,Stop it!
295831,L640689,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options."
295832,L640688,u8768,m595,ADAM,"That is not an ""option."" There is no multiple choice here."
295833,L640687,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Call the police. Okay, that's one option."
295834,L640686,u8768,m595,ADAM,We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
295835,L640685,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here."
295836,L640680,u8768,m595,ADAM,You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
295837,L640679,u8770,m595,BOYD,Are you sure this was an accident?
295838,L640676,u8768,m595,ADAM,Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
295839,L640675,u8770,m595,BOYD,Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
295840,L640674,u8770,m595,BOYD,Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
295841,L640665,u8770,m595,BOYD,Why?
295842,L640664,u8768,m595,ADAM,We have to call the ambulance.
295843,L640663,u8770,m595,BOYD,Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
295844,L640662,u8768,m595,ADAM,Calling the ambulance.
295845,L640661,u8770,m595,BOYD,Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
295846,L640660,u8768,m595,ADAM,I'm calling the ambulance.
295847,L640659,u8770,m595,BOYD,What do you think you are doing?
295848,L640658,u8768,m595,ADAM,What are you talking about?
295849,L640657,u8770,m595,BOYD,What are you doing?
295850,L640656,u8768,m595,ADAM,What?
295851,L640655,u8770,m595,BOYD,Wait!
295852,L640648,u8770,m595,BOYD,You don't know what you're doing.
295853,L640647,u8768,m595,ADAM,She's got no fucking pulse.
295854,L640551,u8768,m595,ADAM,Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
295855,L640550,u8770,m595,BOYD,More.
295856,L640545,u8770,m595,BOYD,"I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications."
295857,L640544,u8768,m595,ADAM,You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
295858,L640543,u8770,m595,BOYD,"One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars."
295859,L640524,u8770,m595,BOYD,You want to hear me out?
295860,L640523,u8768,m595,ADAM,Don't even start.
295861,L640520,u8768,m595,ADAM,I'm not getting a ticket.
295862,L640519,u8770,m595,BOYD,Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
295863,L640959,u8774,m595,LOIS,What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
295864,L640958,u8768,m595,ADAM,There is no candy!
295865,L640957,u8774,m595,LOIS,Where's the candy?
295866,L640944,u8774,m595,LOIS,They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
295867,L640943,u8768,m595,ADAM,Later.
295868,L640942,u8774,m595,LOIS,They're screaming for Starbursts.
295869,L640941,u8768,m595,ADAM,What?
295870,L640940,u8774,m595,LOIS,"Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts."
295871,L640930,u8774,m595,LOIS,They're singing.
295872,L640929,u8768,m595,ADAM,They're driving me nuts!
295873,L640928,u8774,m595,LOIS,Don't snap at them!
295874,L640965,u8768,m595,ADAM,Where's the bathroom?
295875,L640964,u8771,m595,FISHER,I got you.
295876,L640963,u8768,m595,ADAM,"I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack..."
295877,L640962,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?"
295878,L640961,u8768,m595,ADAM,Have you thought about what I said?
295879,L640852,u8768,m595,ADAM,We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
295880,L640851,u8771,m595,FISHER,I don't think so.
295881,L640850,u8768,m595,ADAM,You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
295882,L640849,u8771,m595,FISHER,What.
295883,L640848,u8768,m595,ADAM,I want you to hear me out.
295884,L640799,u8768,m595,ADAM,It has to be done.
295885,L640798,u8771,m595,FISHER,No way.
295886,L640652,u8771,m595,FISHER,What happened? Oh my God...
295887,L640651,u8768,m595,ADAM,Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
295888,L640617,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little..."
295889,L640616,u8771,m595,FISHER,I know...
295890,L640615,u8768,m595,ADAM,If anything ever happens to me...
295891,L640614,u8771,m595,FISHER,I know and I'm honored...
295892,L640613,u8768,m595,ADAM,"I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather..."
295893,L640609,u8768,m595,ADAM,Don't eyeball your kids.
295894,L640608,u8771,m595,FISHER,I won't do it.
295895,L640607,u8768,m595,ADAM,Don't ever stare him down.
295896,L640606,u8771,m595,FISHER,"The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down."
295897,L640592,u8768,m595,ADAM,"Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?"
295898,L640591,u8771,m595,FISHER,No. I think it's fucked.
295899,L640590,u8768,m595,ADAM,Are you solid with that?
295900,L640589,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father."
295901,L640588,u8768,m595,ADAM,"No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake."
295902,L640555,u8768,m595,ADAM,"They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin..."
295903,L640554,u8771,m595,FISHER,Real times.
295904,L640542,u8771,m595,FISHER,No...we want padded chairs...okay?
295905,L640541,u8768,m595,ADAM,That's one idea.
295906,L640454,u8768,m595,ADAM,I know you'll be.  Three hours.
295907,L640453,u8771,m595,FISHER,We'll be ready Adam.
295908,L641236,u8773,m595,LIZ,Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
295909,L641235,u8769,m595,BARRY MORRIS,So. When is the wedding.
295910,L641228,u8773,m595,LIZ,So where's that leave us?
295911,L641227,u8769,m595,BARRY MORRIS,And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
295912,L641226,u8773,m595,LIZ,"Well, oh..."
295913,L641225,u8769,m595,BARRY MORRIS,"Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand."
295914,L641221,u8773,m595,LIZ,What does that mean?
295915,L641220,u8769,m595,BARRY MORRIS,Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
295916,L641219,u8773,m595,LIZ,Money?
295917,L641214,u8769,m595,BARRY MORRIS,There's more.
295918,L641213,u8773,m595,LIZ,My god.
295919,L641136,u8770,m595,BOYD,Lois please.
295920,L641135,u8774,m595,LOIS,I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
295921,L641134,u8770,m595,BOYD,He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
295922,L641130,u8774,m595,LOIS,Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
295923,L641129,u8770,m595,BOYD,Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
295924,L641128,u8774,m595,LOIS,Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
295925,L641124,u8774,m595,LOIS,I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
295926,L641123,u8770,m595,BOYD,Nothing happened in Vegas.
295927,L641122,u8774,m595,LOIS,You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
295928,L641121,u8770,m595,BOYD,I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
295929,L641120,u8774,m595,LOIS,Don't sweet lip me.
295930,L641119,u8770,m595,BOYD,What are you talking about?
295931,L640766,u8779,m595,RALPH,I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
295932,L640765,u8770,m595,BOYD,She's in there!
295933,L640763,u8770,m595,BOYD,Great. Fine. Perfect.
295934,L640762,u8779,m595,RALPH,Is everything okay?
295935,L640761,u8779,m595,RALPH,Sweet deal.
295936,L640760,u8770,m595,BOYD,That's right.
295937,L640759,u8779,m595,RALPH,She's still working?
295938,L640758,u8770,m595,BOYD,She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
295939,L640757,u8779,m595,RALPH,Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
295940,L640756,u8770,m595,BOYD,That's right.
295941,L640755,u8779,m595,RALPH,Doing the bachelor party thing?
295942,L640754,u8770,m595,BOYD,Yup.
295943,L640751,u8779,m595,RALPH,The groom?
295944,L640750,u8770,m595,BOYD,Who?
295945,L640749,u8779,m595,RALPH,So who's the lucky guy?
295946,L640748,u8779,m595,RALPH,Okay. Hi.
295947,L640746,u8770,m595,BOYD,She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
295948,L640745,u8779,m595,RALPH,Where is she?
295949,L640744,u8770,m595,BOYD,She's not here.
295950,L640743,u8779,m595,RALPH,I'm with Tina. Is she there?
295951,L640742,u8770,m595,BOYD,What?
295952,L640741,u8779,m595,RALPH,"Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?"
295953,L640740,u8770,m595,BOYD,What is it?
295954,L641204,u8770,m595,BOYD,"He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here."
295955,L641203,u8777,m595,MOORE,He's too drunk.
295956,L641114,u8770,m595,BOYD,Give me two more.
295957,L641113,u8777,m595,MOORE,He just had two.
295958,L641097,u8770,m595,BOYD,What is her disposition?
295959,L641096,u8777,m595,MOORE,What's goosed?
295960,L641080,u8770,m595,BOYD,I'm not talking to you?
295961,L641079,u8777,m595,MOORE,What's your fucking point?
295962,L640857,u8777,m595,MOORE,Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
295963,L640856,u8770,m595,BOYD,The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
295964,L640804,u8777,m595,MOORE,Here's his head.
295965,L640803,u8770,m595,BOYD,I got her arm.
295966,L640704,u8770,m595,BOYD,We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
295967,L640703,u8777,m595,MOORE,He's right.
295968,L640650,u8777,m595,MOORE,Left side.
295969,L640649,u8770,m595,BOYD,Where do you look? What side of the neck?
295970,L640561,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard..."
295971,L640560,u8777,m595,MOORE,"Keith Richards, Dean Martin..."
295972,L640557,u8777,m595,MOORE,Not tonight.
295973,L640556,u8770,m595,BOYD,But not tonight.
295974,L640547,u8770,m595,BOYD,Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
295975,L640546,u8777,m595,MOORE,I don't think so Boyd.
295976,L640538,u8770,m595,BOYD,"That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big."
295977,L640537,u8777,m595,MOORE,Your investment ideas never work out.
295978,L640528,u8770,m595,BOYD,Fish?
295979,L640527,u8777,m595,MOORE,No I don't.
295980,L641286,u8771,m595,FISHER,You need help.
295981,L641285,u8770,m595,BOYD,"I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!"
295982,L641284,u8771,m595,FISHER,Not a prayer.
295983,L641283,u8770,m595,BOYD,"And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!"
295984,L641282,u8771,m595,FISHER,You're sick.
295985,L641281,u8770,m595,BOYD,Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
295986,L641278,u8770,m595,BOYD,I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
295987,L641277,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm serious.
295988,L641276,u8770,m595,BOYD,Whatever you say Kojak.
295989,L641275,u8771,m595,FISHER,Fine? Fine what?
295990,L641274,u8770,m595,BOYD,Okay fine.
295991,L641273,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!"
295992,L641272,u8770,m595,BOYD,You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
295993,L641271,u8771,m595,FISHER,You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
295994,L641270,u8770,m595,BOYD,My what?
295995,L641269,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
295996,L641268,u8770,m595,BOYD,This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
295997,L641197,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?"
295998,L641196,u8771,m595,FISHER,Isn't it a little late?
295999,L641195,u8770,m595,BOYD,That's right.
296000,L641194,u8771,m595,FISHER,Now?
296001,L641193,u8770,m595,BOYD,That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
296002,L641192,u8771,m595,FISHER,Hear what?
296003,L641191,u8770,m595,BOYD,Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
296004,L641190,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yeah.
296005,L641189,u8770,m595,BOYD,I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
296006,L641188,u8771,m595,FISHER,What does that mean?
296007,L641187,u8770,m595,BOYD,Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
296008,L641153,u8770,m595,BOYD,You got a nasty side to your thought process.
296009,L641152,u8771,m595,FISHER,I don't know...
296010,L641151,u8770,m595,BOYD,And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
296011,L641150,u8771,m595,FISHER,What does that mean?
296012,L641149,u8770,m595,BOYD,Take care of business.
296013,L641148,u8771,m595,FISHER,What are you going to do?
296014,L641147,u8770,m595,BOYD,Just do it.
296015,L641146,u8771,m595,FISHER,I don't think that's such a good idea.
296016,L641145,u8770,m595,BOYD,"After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep."
296017,L641117,u8770,m595,BOYD,Suck my ass.
296018,L641116,u8771,m595,FISHER,Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
296019,L641100,u8771,m595,FISHER,"No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right."
296020,L641099,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?"
296021,L641098,u8771,m595,FISHER,Regarding what?
296022,L641082,u8770,m595,BOYD,"You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes."
296023,L641081,u8771,m595,FISHER,What's your point?
296024,L641078,u8770,m595,BOYD,Exactly! Exactly my point.
296025,L641077,u8771,m595,FISHER,I just want to get married.
296026,L641076,u8770,m595,BOYD,What you just said. Say it again.
296027,L641075,u8771,m595,FISHER,What?
296028,L641074,u8770,m595,BOYD,Say it again.
296029,L641073,u8771,m595,FISHER,I don't know! I just want to get married.
296030,L641072,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?"
296031,L641071,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I said, what have we done?"
296032,L641070,u8770,m595,BOYD,What is the question you asked me?
296033,L641069,u8771,m595,FISHER,What?
296034,L641068,u8770,m595,BOYD,What did you ask me?
296035,L641067,u8771,m595,FISHER,Boyd...What have we done?
296036,L641066,u8770,m595,BOYD,He is not cracking up.
296037,L641065,u8771,m595,FISHER,He's cracked up.
296038,L641047,u8770,m595,BOYD,No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
296039,L641046,u8771,m595,FISHER,Easy Boyd.
296040,L640977,u8771,m595,FISHER,He's having a problem here.
296041,L640976,u8770,m595,BOYD,Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
296042,L640975,u8771,m595,FISHER,Shut up Boyd.
296043,L640974,u8770,m595,BOYD,OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
296044,L640972,u8771,m595,FISHER,"No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking..."
296045,L640971,u8770,m595,BOYD,The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
296046,L640968,u8771,m595,FISHER,You always were a jealous man.
296047,L640967,u8770,m595,BOYD,Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
296048,L640861,u8770,m595,BOYD,"However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?"
296049,L640860,u8771,m595,FISHER,"It goes; ""Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."""
296050,L640830,u8770,m595,BOYD,"No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker."
296051,L640829,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this."
296052,L640814,u8770,m595,BOYD,Go ahead.
296053,L640813,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm talking about prayer.
296054,L640812,u8770,m595,BOYD,What kind of words?
296055,L640811,u8771,m595,FISHER,I think we should say some words over the grave.
296056,L640810,u8770,m595,BOYD,"That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves."
296057,L640774,u8770,m595,BOYD,So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
296058,L640773,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm calling the police.
296059,L640772,u8770,m595,BOYD,All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
296060,L640730,u8771,m595,FISHER,Good God...Good God...
296061,L640729,u8770,m595,BOYD,Nobody knows she's here.
296062,L640714,u8770,m595,BOYD,What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
296063,L640713,u8771,m595,FISHER,Oh God. This is insane.
296064,L640710,u8770,m595,BOYD,Nobody knows.
296065,L640709,u8771,m595,FISHER,Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
296066,L640692,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose..."
296067,L640691,u8771,m595,FISHER,Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
296068,L640671,u8770,m595,BOYD,Shut up.
296069,L640670,u8771,m595,FISHER,Call 911.
296070,L640669,u8770,m595,BOYD,Shut up.

296072,L640667,u8770,m595,BOYD,No.
296073,L640666,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Oh, Jesus...call the police."
296074,L640624,u8771,m595,FISHER,I can't.
296075,L640623,u8770,m595,BOYD,She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
296076,L640534,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English..."
296077,L640533,u8771,m595,FISHER,We need padded chairs.
296078,L640532,u8770,m595,BOYD,That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
296079,L640531,u8771,m595,FISHER,"No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay."
296080,L640530,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir."
296081,L640529,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs..."
296082,L640522,u8770,m595,BOYD,Who's up for making some real money?
296083,L640521,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold."
296084,L640511,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Well, I didn't mean it."
296085,L640510,u8771,m595,FISHER,You said that Boyd.
296086,L641202,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I love you.
296087,L641201,u8770,m595,BOYD,Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
296088,L641200,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,How about my Fatburger?
296089,L641199,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy."
296090,L641112,u8770,m595,BOYD,Give me the Valium.
296091,L641111,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Goosed!
296092,L641110,u8770,m595,BOYD,Stop.
296093,L641109,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Goosed!
296094,L641108,u8770,m595,BOYD,Stop it!
296095,L641102,u8770,m595,BOYD,Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
296096,L641101,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,We're goosed! Goosed by God!
296097,L641095,u8770,m595,BOYD,We're not goosed.
296098,L641094,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,We're goosed.
296099,L641055,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
296100,L641054,u8770,m595,BOYD,Easy Micheal.
296101,L641053,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for ""The Immaculate Reception,"" his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime."
296102,L641052,u8770,m595,BOYD,You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
296103,L641051,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Ball park sausages.
296104,L641050,u8770,m595,BOYD,The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
296105,L641025,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You will not screw this up.
296106,L641024,u8770,m595,BOYD,This is going to stop right now. Right now!
296107,L640902,u8770,m595,BOYD,No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
296108,L640901,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You said nobody would miss her.
296109,L640900,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all."
296110,L640777,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders."
296111,L640776,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Not really, no."
296112,L640775,u8770,m595,BOYD,"A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?"
296113,L640612,u8770,m595,BOYD,"That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?"
296114,L640611,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,They need leadership.
296115,L640610,u8770,m595,BOYD,The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
296116,L640605,u8770,m595,BOYD,"Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico."
296117,L640604,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,What?
296118,L640603,u8770,m595,BOYD,Take Mexico.
296119,L640602,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,What? What's your point?
296120,L640601,u8770,m595,BOYD,There's my point exactly.
296121,L640600,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies."
296122,L640599,u8770,m595,BOYD,Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
296123,L640598,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,What's your point?
296124,L640597,u8770,m595,BOYD,"I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot."
296125,L640596,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
296126,L640595,u8770,m595,BOYD,Then what do they have?
296127,L640594,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Israel doesn't have a King.
296128,L640593,u8770,m595,BOYD,"If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?"
296129,L640587,u8770,m595,BOYD,New king.
296130,L640586,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,And what happens when you can't?
296131,L640585,u8770,m595,BOYD,"I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night."
296132,L640584,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You have a King fantasy.
296133,L640583,u8770,m595,BOYD,Not true.
296134,L640582,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,True.
296135,L640581,u8770,m595,BOYD,False.
296136,L640580,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You hate women.
296137,L640579,u8770,m595,BOYD,I don't hate women.
296138,L640540,u8770,m595,BOYD,Oh really? Starbucks?
296139,L640539,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Your ideas never work out.
296140,L640526,u8770,m595,BOYD,Moore?
296141,L640525,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Nope.
296142,L640509,u8770,m595,BOYD,I never heard that.
296143,L640508,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
296144,L640507,u8770,m595,BOYD,The hell I did!
296145,L640506,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,The hell you didn't!
296146,L640505,u8770,m595,BOYD,The hell I did!
296147,L640500,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,It's my fucking opinion.
296148,L640499,u8770,m595,BOYD,You're a fucking moron.
296149,L641296,u8771,m595,FISHER,I do.
296150,L641295,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,"These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?"
296151,L641293,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,The rings?
296152,L641292,u8771,m595,FISHER,What?
296153,L641291,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,May we have the rings please?
296154,L640876,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,"It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't."
296155,L640875,u8771,m595,FISHER,Are we supposed to?
296156,L640874,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
296157,L640873,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
296158,L641324,u8773,m595,LIZ,Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
296159,L641323,u8771,m595,FISHER,But...
296160,L641322,u8773,m595,LIZ,You put him down or don't bother coming back.
296161,L641321,u8771,m595,FISHER,No...
296162,L641320,u8773,m595,LIZ,If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
296163,L641319,u8771,m595,FISHER,What?
296164,L641318,u8773,m595,LIZ,"You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too."
296165,L641317,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much..."
296166,L641313,u8771,m595,FISHER,Move the bodies?
296167,L641312,u8773,m595,LIZ,Move the bodies.
296168,L641311,u8771,m595,FISHER,So what do we do?
296169,L641310,u8773,m595,LIZ,The only proof is those bodies.
296170,L641309,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried."
296171,L641308,u8773,m595,LIZ,Like how?
296172,L641307,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Like if something happened to him, he could still get us."
296173,L641306,u8773,m595,LIZ,What does that mean?
296174,L641305,u8771,m595,FISHER,He kept saying he was protected.
296175,L641280,u8771,m595,FISHER,What money?
296176,L641279,u8773,m595,LIZ,I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
296177,L641265,u8773,m595,LIZ,"No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!"
296178,L641264,u8771,m595,FISHER,But...
296179,L641263,u8773,m595,LIZ,No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
296180,L641262,u8771,m595,FISHER,But...
296181,L641261,u8773,m595,LIZ,Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
296182,L641260,u8771,m595,FISHER,She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
296183,L641259,u8773,m595,LIZ,You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
296184,L641258,u8771,m595,FISHER,She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
296185,L641257,u8773,m595,LIZ,"My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?"
296186,L641256,u8771,m595,FISHER,It's too late.
296187,L641255,u8773,m595,LIZ,Call the police.
296188,L641254,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Micheal, by accident."
296189,L641253,u8773,m595,LIZ,You killed a prostitute.
296190,L641252,u8771,m595,FISHER,No Micheal did. It was an accident.
296191,L641251,u8773,m595,LIZ,You fucked a prostitute?
296192,L641250,u8771,m595,FISHER,The prostitute.
296193,L641249,u8773,m595,LIZ,Who's dead?
296194,L641248,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident."
296195,L641247,u8773,m595,LIZ,What are you talking about?
296196,L641246,u8771,m595,FISHER,Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
296197,L641245,u8773,m595,LIZ,What kind of stupid question is that?
296198,L641244,u8771,m595,FISHER,Do you love me?
296199,L641243,u8773,m595,LIZ,What?
296200,L641242,u8771,m595,FISHER,Do you love me?
296201,L641241,u8773,m595,LIZ,Don't even.
296202,L641240,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off."
296203,L641239,u8773,m595,LIZ,Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
296204,L641238,u8771,m595,FISHER,No it's not okay. It's not.
296205,L641237,u8773,m595,LIZ,It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
296206,L641224,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yes.
296207,L641223,u8773,m595,LIZ,No.
296208,L641222,u8771,m595,FISHER,That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
296209,L641163,u8771,m595,FISHER,Okay. Okay.
296210,L641162,u8773,m595,LIZ,Yeah. You.
296211,L641161,u8771,m595,FISHER,Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
296212,L641160,u8773,m595,LIZ,I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
296213,L641159,u8771,m595,FISHER,No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
296214,L641158,u8773,m595,LIZ,I won't even discuss it.
296215,L641157,u8771,m595,FISHER,I know.
296216,L641156,u8773,m595,LIZ,We're not canceling.
296217,L641155,u8771,m595,FISHER,Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
296218,L641089,u8773,m595,LIZ,Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
296219,L641088,u8771,m595,FISHER,Can we just talk this out?
296220,L641087,u8773,m595,LIZ,No way.
296221,L641086,u8771,m595,FISHER,Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
296222,L641085,u8773,m595,LIZ,Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
296223,L641023,u8771,m595,FISHER,No baby. We'll all be right in.
296224,L641022,u8773,m595,LIZ,Are they fighting?
296225,L641021,u8771,m595,FISHER,Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
296226,L640995,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business."
296227,L640994,u8773,m595,LIZ,Now?
296228,L640993,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yeah. Sure.
296229,L640992,u8773,m595,LIZ,"Well, can you come back inside?"
296230,L640991,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yeah baby. Everything's great.
296231,L640920,u8773,m595,LIZ,"After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house..."
296232,L640919,u8771,m595,FISHER,This is our honeymoon.
296233,L640885,u8773,m595,LIZ,"""At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."""
296234,L640884,u8771,m595,FISHER,"""Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me."
296235,L640870,u8773,m595,LIZ,Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
296236,L640869,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm working on it.
296237,L640868,u8773,m595,LIZ,What's the word on the chairs?
296238,L640846,u8771,m595,FISHER,No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
296239,L640845,u8773,m595,LIZ,You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
296240,L640844,u8771,m595,FISHER,I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
296241,L640843,u8773,m595,LIZ,The chairs.
296242,L640842,u8771,m595,FISHER,What!
296243,L640841,u8773,m595,LIZ,What okay?
296244,L640840,u8771,m595,FISHER,Okay.
296245,L640839,u8773,m595,LIZ,What about the chairs?
296246,L640838,u8771,m595,FISHER,No. Just like an hour or so.
296247,L640837,u8773,m595,LIZ,How late?
296248,L640836,u8771,m595,FISHER,We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
296249,L640835,u8773,m595,LIZ,Where are you?
296250,L640834,u8771,m595,FISHER,Hey. It's me.
296251,L640833,u8773,m595,LIZ,Hello.
296252,L640578,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'll see you tomorrow...
296253,L640577,u8773,m595,LIZ,Go have fun. Not too much.
296254,L640576,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm mad at you.
296255,L640575,u8773,m595,LIZ,Yeah. Nesting.
296256,L640574,u8771,m595,FISHER,Nesting?
296257,L640573,u8773,m595,LIZ,Just a bit of organizing.
296258,L640572,u8771,m595,FISHER,What are you doing?
296259,L640571,u8773,m595,LIZ,Well you should.
296260,L640570,u8771,m595,FISHER,Well I do.
296261,L640569,u8773,m595,LIZ,That's sweet.
296262,L640568,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you."
296263,L640567,u8773,m595,LIZ,"Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?"
296264,L640566,u8771,m595,FISHER,Not yet.
296265,L640565,u8773,m595,LIZ,Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
296266,L640564,u8771,m595,FISHER,Hi.
296267,L640563,u8773,m595,LIZ,Hello.
296268,L640497,u8773,m595,LIZ,Have a nice bachelor party.
296269,L640496,u8771,m595,FISHER,I love you.
296270,L640495,u8773,m595,LIZ,Just call and let me know that your okay.
296271,L640494,u8771,m595,FISHER,Of course.
296272,L640493,u8773,m595,LIZ,Do you love me?
296273,L640492,u8771,m595,FISHER,I will.
296274,L640491,u8773,m595,LIZ,Will you please call the chair people?
296275,L640481,u8773,m595,LIZ,Maybe.
296276,L640480,u8771,m595,FISHER,We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
296277,L640479,u8773,m595,LIZ,Take care of those chairs.
296278,L640478,u8771,m595,FISHER,More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
296279,L640477,u8773,m595,LIZ,Do you love me?
296280,L640476,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'll call them from the road.
296281,L640475,u8773,m595,LIZ,I need your help.
296282,L640474,u8771,m595,FISHER,We're leaving in three hours.
296283,L640473,u8773,m595,LIZ,I need your help.
296284,L640472,u8771,m595,FISHER,Honey I don't have the time...
296285,L640471,u8773,m595,LIZ,Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
296286,L640470,u8771,m595,FISHER,Go down where?
296287,L640469,u8773,m595,LIZ,You go down there.
296288,L640468,u8771,m595,FISHER,So what do we do?
296289,L640467,u8773,m595,LIZ,Not padded ones.
296290,L640466,u8771,m595,FISHER,What kind of seats can we have?
296291,L640465,u8773,m595,LIZ,"We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded."
296292,L640464,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm not. What's the problem?
296293,L640463,u8773,m595,LIZ,Keith do not trivialize this.
296294,L640462,u8771,m595,FISHER,Okay.
296295,L640461,u8773,m595,LIZ,Seating problems.
296296,L640460,u8771,m595,FISHER,Problems?
296297,L640459,u8773,m595,LIZ,We've got problems here.
296298,L640435,u8773,m595,LIZ,Kiss me...?
296299,L640434,u8771,m595,FISHER,With all my heart.
296300,L640433,u8773,m595,LIZ,How much?
296301,L640432,u8771,m595,FISHER,Of course.
296302,L640431,u8773,m595,LIZ,Do you love me?
296303,L640429,u8771,m595,FISHER,You will not be common!!!
296304,L640428,u8773,m595,LIZ,I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
296305,L640427,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
296306,L640426,u8773,m595,LIZ,I've seen it on television.
296307,L640425,u8771,m595,FISHER,That's absurd.
296308,L640424,u8773,m595,LIZ,It's vile!
296309,L640423,u8771,m595,FISHER,Time out.
296310,L640422,u8773,m595,LIZ,"You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on ""Oprah"" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them."
296311,L640421,u8771,m595,FISHER,You expect more what?
296312,L640420,u8773,m595,LIZ,He's weird. And I expect more from you.
296313,L640419,u8771,m595,FISHER,He's a great chef.
296314,L640418,u8773,m595,LIZ,Why? What's his problem?
296315,L640417,u8771,m595,FISHER,He just doesn't talk a lot.
296316,L640416,u8773,m595,LIZ,He's weird.
296317,L640415,u8771,m595,FISHER,He's quiet.
296318,L640414,u8773,m595,LIZ,He's weird.
296319,L640413,u8771,m595,FISHER,I've known him since Cub Scouts.
296320,L640412,u8773,m595,LIZ,I just don't see him in the big picture.
296321,L640411,u8771,m595,FISHER,What does Moore have to do with your growing?
296322,L640410,u8773,m595,LIZ,It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
296323,L640409,u8771,m595,FISHER,You don't like Moore? Since when?
296324,L640408,u8773,m595,LIZ,Charles Moore for instants.
296325,L640407,u8771,m595,FISHER,Who else?
296326,L640406,u8773,m595,LIZ,I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
296327,L640405,u8771,m595,FISHER,I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
296328,L640404,u8773,m595,LIZ,"I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself."
296329,L640403,u8771,m595,FISHER,What are you talking about?
296330,L640402,u8773,m595,LIZ,Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
296331,L640396,u8773,m595,LIZ,David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
296332,L640395,u8771,m595,FISHER,He's my friend. He's not a moron.
296333,L640394,u8773,m595,LIZ,He's a moron.
296334,L640393,u8771,m595,FISHER,He is.
296335,L640392,u8773,m595,LIZ,I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
296336,L640391,u8771,m595,FISHER,It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
296337,L640390,u8773,m595,LIZ,Right before the wedding?
296338,L640389,u8771,m595,FISHER,How do you figure?
296339,L640388,u8773,m595,LIZ,Well it's bad timing.
296340,L640387,u8771,m595,FISHER,"They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it."
296341,L640386,u8773,m595,LIZ,It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
296342,L640385,u8771,m595,FISHER,I wouldn't know.
296343,L640384,u8773,m595,LIZ,I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
296344,L640383,u8771,m595,FISHER,Are we going to do this again?
296345,L640382,u8773,m595,LIZ,I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
296346,L640381,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
296347,L640380,u8773,m595,LIZ,You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
296348,L640379,u8771,m595,FISHER,Stop it. I'm sorry.
296349,L640378,u8773,m595,LIZ,"Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't..."
296350,L640377,u8771,m595,FISHER,What?
296351,L640376,u8773,m595,LIZ,Don't you dare.
296352,L640375,u8771,m595,FISHER,Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
296353,L640374,u8773,m595,LIZ,I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
296354,L640373,u8771,m595,FISHER,How could I know what else I forgot?
296355,L640372,u8773,m595,LIZ,What else have you forgot?
296356,L640371,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm not playing around. I forgot.
296357,L640370,u8773,m595,LIZ,You can't play around with these tent people.
296358,L640369,u8771,m595,FISHER,I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
296359,L640368,u8773,m595,LIZ,Why did you forget the tent check?
296360,L640367,u8771,m595,FISHER,Why what?
296361,L640366,u8773,m595,LIZ,Why?
296362,L640365,u8771,m595,FISHER,I think so.
296363,L640364,u8773,m595,LIZ,You forgot the tent?
296364,L640363,u8771,m595,FISHER,I think I forgot the tent.
296365,L640362,u8773,m595,LIZ,"Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge..."
296366,L640361,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yes.
296367,L640360,u8773,m595,LIZ,Caterer?
296368,L640359,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yup.
296369,L640358,u8773,m595,LIZ,Florist?
296370,L640357,u8771,m595,FISHER,Sent it.
296371,L640356,u8773,m595,LIZ,Photographer?
296372,L640355,u8771,m595,FISHER,Sent it.
296373,L640354,u8773,m595,LIZ,The wedding cake check?
296374,L640353,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are."
296375,L640352,u8773,m595,LIZ,"What do you mean, you think so?"
296376,L640351,u8771,m595,FISHER,I think so.
296377,L640350,u8773,m595,LIZ,Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
296378,L640349,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm not sure.
296379,L640348,u8773,m595,LIZ,Why is this Kid staring at me?
296380,L640347,u8771,m595,FISHER,I don't think so.
296381,L640346,u8773,m595,LIZ,Can't we do it on the phone?
296382,L640345,u8771,m595,FISHER,We missed the deadline.
296383,L640344,u8773,m595,LIZ,Why can't we do it through the mail?
296384,L640343,u8771,m595,FISHER,Government cutbacks.
296385,L640342,u8773,m595,LIZ,This is ridiculous.
296386,L640999,u8771,m595,FISHER,"OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on."
296387,L640998,u8778,m595,MR. FISHER,"Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here."
296388,L640997,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Yeah, Dad. It's great."
296389,L640996,u8778,m595,MR. FISHER,Everything okay?
296390,L640895,u8778,m595,MR. FISHER,"I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!"
296391,L640894,u8771,m595,FISHER,I love you dad.
296392,L640893,u8778,m595,MR. FISHER,Just kills me...
296393,L640892,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Harry Chaplin. ""Cats in the Cradle."""
296394,L640891,u8778,m595,MR. FISHER,"I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, ""My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me."" Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me."
296395,L640890,u8771,m595,FISHER,You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
296396,L640889,u8778,m595,MR. FISHER,I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
296397,L640888,u8771,m595,FISHER,You did all right dad.
296398,L640887,u8778,m595,MR. FISHER,"I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you..."
296399,L641185,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
296400,L641184,u8771,m595,FISHER,What is it?
296401,L641183,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
296402,L641182,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois."
296403,L641181,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit."
296404,L641176,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things."
296405,L641175,u8771,m595,FISHER,I think so.
296406,L641174,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?"
296407,L641173,u8771,m595,FISHER,The wahoo moment?
296408,L641172,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?"
296409,L641171,u8771,m595,FISHER,The wahoo?
296410,L641170,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... ""Get ready""...""watch for it""...""here it comes,"" here comes the ""wahoo""."
296411,L641169,u8771,m595,FISHER,Have another drink.
296412,L641168,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem."
296413,L641167,u8771,m595,FISHER,I don't hear it.
296414,L641166,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
296415,L641165,u8771,m595,FISHER,Buzzing?
296416,L641164,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Do you hear buzzing Fish?
296417,L640897,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,At the newsstand on 3rd.
296418,L640896,u8771,m595,FISHER,Where did you get that?
296419,L640816,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
296420,L640815,u8771,m595,FISHER,Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
296421,L640723,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
296422,L640722,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm getting married...
296423,L640627,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Come on.
296424,L640626,u8771,m595,FISHER,Go for it.
296425,L640625,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I'll take a ride.
296426,L640457,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,So?
296427,L640456,u8771,m595,FISHER,He's your brother.
296428,L640455,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I don't care for him.
296429,L640447,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes."
296430,L640446,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You're not breathing right?
296431,L640445,u8771,m595,FISHER,I'm not breathing right.
296432,L640444,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body."
296433,L640443,u8771,m595,FISHER,I just want her to be happy.
296434,L640442,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards."
296435,L640441,u8771,m595,FISHER,About what?
296436,L640440,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,It means she's insecure.
296437,L640439,u8771,m595,FISHER,What does that mean?
296438,L640438,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
296439,L640437,u8771,m595,FISHER,I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
296440,L640436,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,That's just insecurity.
296441,L641347,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yup.
296442,L641346,u8777,m595,MOORE,Well that ought to be about the end of that.
296443,L641345,u8777,m595,MOORE,That's what I'm thinking.
296444,L641344,u8771,m595,FISHER,I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
296445,L641342,u8777,m595,MOORE,I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
296446,L641341,u8771,m595,FISHER,That's a good one.
296447,L641340,u8777,m595,MOORE,I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
296448,L641339,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yeah?
296449,L641334,u8777,m595,MOORE,Where?
296450,L641333,u8771,m595,FISHER,There.
296451,L641330,u8771,m595,FISHER,"That's right, ""Pup Corn."" Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of ""Pup Corn"" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes ""Shelmer,"" our 8 year old mutt. ""Here Shelmer,"" my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, ""Here girl."" This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the ""Pup Corn."" Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, ""Pup Corn"" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never."
296452,L641329,u8777,m595,MOORE,Pup corn?
296453,L641328,u8771,m595,FISHER,"I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - ""Pup Corn."""
296454,L641327,u8777,m595,MOORE,I guess.
296455,L641326,u8771,m595,FISHER,"Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping ""Immaculate Reception?"" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?"
296456,L641325,u8777,m595,MOORE,You alright?
296457,L641304,u8777,m595,MOORE,All week long.
296458,L641303,u8771,m595,FISHER,Did he try to kiss you?
296459,L641302,u8777,m595,MOORE,"He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading ""Atlas Shrugged,"" staring at himself in the mirror."
296460,L641301,u8771,m595,FISHER,My God...
296461,L641300,u8777,m595,MOORE,"He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his."
296462,L641290,u8771,m595,FISHER,Downstairs in the closet.
296463,L641289,u8777,m595,MOORE,Where's Boyd?
296464,L641209,u8777,m595,MOORE,"Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim..."
296465,L641208,u8771,m595,FISHER,Greenpeace?
296466,L641207,u8777,m595,MOORE,Greenpeace.
296467,L641206,u8771,m595,FISHER,A move?
296468,L641205,u8777,m595,MOORE,I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
296469,L641107,u8771,m595,FISHER,Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
296470,L641106,u8777,m595,MOORE,You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
296471,L641105,u8771,m595,FISHER,I have no idea.
296472,L641104,u8777,m595,MOORE,Did she believe you?
296473,L641103,u8771,m595,FISHER,I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
296474,L640859,u8777,m595,MOORE,What?
296475,L640858,u8771,m595,FISHER,The first day.
296476,L640809,u8771,m595,FISHER,I got to agree with that.
296477,L640808,u8777,m595,MOORE,Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
296478,L640646,u8777,m595,MOORE,How do you know she's dead.
296479,L640645,u8771,m595,FISHER,No...No.
296480,L640334,u8771,m595,FISHER,Yup.
296481,L640333,u8777,m595,MOORE,That ought to be about the end of that.
296482,L641298,u8773,m595,LIZ,I do.
296483,L641297,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,"Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?"
296484,L640883,u8773,m595,LIZ,"You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower."
296485,L640882,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,Oh I know that. How does it go...
296486,L640881,u8773,m595,LIZ,"""You Send Me."""
296487,L640880,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,What song?
296488,L640879,u8773,m595,LIZ,We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
296489,L640878,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,Okay great. What will that be?
296490,L640877,u8773,m595,LIZ,"We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out."
296491,L640872,u8773,m595,LIZ,"I kind of like ""till death do us part."" I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?"
296492,L640871,u8772,m595,JUDGE TOWER,"We don't say ""love, honor and obey"" anymore. And we don't say ""till death do us part."" Today we say, ""respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love."" How does that sound?"
296493,L640489,u8774,m595,LOIS,"Okay boys, smile!"
296494,L640488,u8773,m595,LIZ,A mutant species.
296495,L640487,u8774,m595,LOIS,The post-Vegas Man.
296496,L640486,u8773,m595,LIZ,The stone age.
296497,L640485,u8774,m595,LOIS,"...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state..."
296498,L640484,u8773,m595,LIZ,"...embarrassing, shameful..."
296499,L640483,u8774,m595,LOIS,"...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile..."
296500,L640923,u8775,m595,MAGGIE,"Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling."
296501,L640922,u8773,m595,LIZ,That's our plan.
296502,L640921,u8775,m595,MAGGIE,"Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had."
296503,L640918,u8775,m595,MAGGIE,So where to on the honeymoon?
296504,L640917,u8773,m595,LIZ,We will.
296505,L640916,u8775,m595,MAGGIE,Take your time. I wish I had.
296506,L640915,u8773,m595,LIZ,"We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids."
296507,L640914,u8775,m595,MAGGIE,Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
296508,L640913,u8773,m595,LIZ,"I love it. I just love, love, love, love it."
296509,L641180,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
296510,L641179,u8777,m595,MOORE,I don't think that's a good idea.
296511,L641178,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
296512,L641057,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,I KILLED MY BROTHER!
296513,L641056,u8777,m595,MOORE,Shut up Micheal.
296514,L640863,u8777,m595,MOORE,That's right.
296515,L640862,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Right.
296516,L640728,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,"Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert."
296517,L640727,u8777,m595,MOORE,Fucking desert.
296518,L640678,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,It was an accident!
296519,L640677,u8777,m595,MOORE,She's dead.
296520,L640553,u8776,m595,MICHEAL,Drum banging real times.
296521,L640552,u8777,m595,MOORE,Good times.
296522,L642515,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,It's a present from my parents.
296523,L642514,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Where's the camera?
296524,L642508,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,"Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart."
296525,L642507,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,"Stop this, stop this."
296526,L642450,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,"Yes, yes."
296527,L642449,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
296528,L642439,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,You'd like me to kill them?
296529,L642438,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
296530,L642247,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
296531,L642246,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,"No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too."
296532,L642245,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Give them to Refugio.
296533,L642244,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,"No, the children sleep with me."
296534,L642243,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,I'll come to you tonight.
296535,L642537,u8794,m596,POCA,"Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss."
296536,L642536,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Take me there.
296537,L642535,u8794,m596,POCA,That one.
296538,L642534,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Which couch?
296539,L642533,u8794,m596,POCA,They're playing games behind the couch ...
296540,L642532,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,What about them?
296541,L642531,u8794,m596,POCA,Enedina and Paco ...
296542,L642530,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,What's that?
296543,L642529,u8794,m596,POCA,Don Amalio!
296544,L642487,u8794,m596,POCA,Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
296545,L642486,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
296546,L642296,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
296547,L642295,u8794,m596,POCA,"No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill."
296548,L642199,u8794,m596,POCA,So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
296549,L642198,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,"When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother."
296550,L642143,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Then it's a respectable house.
296551,L642142,u8794,m596,POCA,Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
296552,L642141,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,Are there many windows?
296553,L642140,u8794,m596,POCA,Two.
296554,L642139,u8781,m596,DON AMALIO,So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
296555,L642065,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Then you won't forgive me?
296556,L642064,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
296557,L642063,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go."
296558,L642062,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
296559,L642061,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,You must listen to me before you go.
296560,L642060,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Let me pass!
296561,L642051,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Go away! Leave me alone.
296562,L642050,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
296563,L642047,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself."
296564,L642046,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,You're lying.
296565,L642036,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Don't go!
296566,L642035,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Leave us alone, Ramona."
296567,L641999,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
296568,L641998,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house."
296569,L641990,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Maybe ...
296570,L641989,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different."
296571,L641988,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Unfortunately ...
296572,L641987,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ..."
296573,L641986,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you."
296574,L641984,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed."
296575,L641983,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Wasn't that cowardice?
296576,L641982,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell."
296577,L641981,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man."
296578,L641980,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,You must think I'm mad.
296579,L641977,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim."
296580,L641976,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!"
296581,L641972,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Today I can refuse you nothing.
296582,L641971,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
296583,L641970,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Whatever you like.
296584,L641969,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
296585,L641968,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Thank you, Uncle."
296586,L641967,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave."
296587,L641966,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ..."
296588,L641965,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death."
296589,L641936,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"No, but what a pity life is like that."
296590,L641935,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,You must think I am a monster.
296591,L641934,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
296592,L641933,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,And this innocent child.
296593,L641932,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
296594,L641930,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
296595,L641929,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Evil.
296596,L641928,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
296597,L641927,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,How could anybody behave like that?
296598,L641926,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Never.
296599,L641925,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Don't you ever see him?
296600,L641924,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Yes, it is."
296601,L641923,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?"
296602,L641922,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,How did you know about that?
296603,L641918,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Nothing. I didn't say anything.
296604,L641917,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,What do you mean?
296605,L641916,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Only because you want it.
296606,L641915,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
296607,L641914,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
296608,L641885,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"You see, even the voice."
296609,L641884,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I know, Uncle, you've told me that already."
296610,L641883,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"How like your aunt you are, even in your walk."
296611,L641882,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Come down.
296612,L641881,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
296613,L641880,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Who is she?
296614,L641879,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Come down here, you scamp."
296615,L641877,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
296616,L641876,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle."
296617,L641873,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,No.
296618,L641872,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,You have no feelings toward ...
296619,L641871,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ..."
296620,L641870,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
296621,L641869,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,No. Mother Superior told me to come.
296622,L641868,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Was that difficult to get?
296623,L641867,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days."
296624,L641866,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,How long are you staying?
296625,L641865,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,You'll think you're still at the convent.
296626,L641864,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle."
296627,L641863,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?"
296628,L641862,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Yes, Uncle. How are you?"
296629,L642069,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir."
296630,L642068,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
296631,L642067,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"Yes, sir."
296632,L642066,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"You believe me, don't you?"
296633,L642057,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her."
296634,L642056,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"But what can I say to her, sir?"
296635,L642055,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
296636,L642054,u8795,m596,RAMONA,Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
296637,L642053,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her."
296638,L641954,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?"
296639,L641953,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl."
296640,L641952,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything."
296641,L641951,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?"
296642,L641950,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn."
296643,L641949,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?"
296644,L641948,u8795,m596,RAMONA,What's the matter?
296645,L641947,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"Sit down, I'm going to need your help."
296646,L641944,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,"I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone."
296647,L641943,u8795,m596,RAMONA,Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
296648,L641889,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"Yes, sir. Good night."
296649,L641888,u8782,m596,DON JAIME,Leave me now. You can go to bed.
296650,L642548,u8794,m596,POCA,"I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ..."
296651,L642547,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
296652,L642513,u8794,m596,POCA,Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
296653,L642512,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,Yes.
296654,L642511,u8794,m596,POCA,Is it all right?
296655,L642447,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,"If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours."
296656,L642446,u8794,m596,POCA,She won't even know.
296657,L642445,u8783,m596,ENEDINA,What will the lady say?
296658,L642384,u8786,m596,JORGE,"Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon."
296659,L642383,u8784,m596,FOREMAN,"No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?"
296660,L642382,u8786,m596,JORGE,"Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?"
296661,L642327,u8784,m596,FOREMAN,That's good land.
296662,L642326,u8786,m596,JORGE,And in the vegetable plot?
296663,L642325,u8784,m596,FOREMAN,It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
296664,L642324,u8786,m596,JORGE,The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
296665,L642323,u8784,m596,FOREMAN,Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
296666,L642306,u8786,m596,JORGE,Good.
296667,L642305,u8784,m596,FOREMAN,That's it.
296668,L642304,u8786,m596,JORGE,That's fifteen by seven?
296669,L642303,u8784,m596,FOREMAN,Fifteen yards.
296670,L642302,u8786,m596,JORGE,How much is that?
296671,L642566,u8785,m596,HOBBLY,"Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ..."
296672,L642565,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Ramona! Ramona!
296673,L642557,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,But why? Why?
296674,L642556,u8785,m596,HOBBLY,He was asking for it.
296675,L642555,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"My God, what have you done to him!"
296676,L642301,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,That doesn't matter; I like it.
296677,L642300,u8785,m596,HOBBLY,Thank you; but it's missing something.
296678,L642299,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,It's very good.
296679,L642279,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
296680,L642278,u8785,m596,HOBBLY,It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
296681,L642277,u8785,m596,HOBBLY,"Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty."
296682,L642276,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Me?
296683,L642379,u8786,m596,JORGE,"That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?"
296684,L642378,u8788,m596,LUCIA,You see how much you like her?
296685,L642377,u8786,m596,JORGE,Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
296686,L642376,u8788,m596,LUCIA,I think I'd better go tomorrow.
296687,L642375,u8786,m596,JORGE,How in hell does it wind up?
296688,L642372,u8788,m596,LUCIA,It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
296689,L642371,u8786,m596,JORGE,She isn't my cousin.
296690,L642370,u8788,m596,LUCIA,That your cousin is more to your taste.
296691,L642369,u8786,m596,JORGE,What are you thinking about?
296692,L642368,u8786,m596,JORGE,You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
296693,L642367,u8788,m596,LUCIA,I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
296694,L642366,u8786,m596,JORGE,"Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ..."
296695,L642365,u8788,m596,LUCIA,"You're happy, aren't you!"
296696,L642364,u8786,m596,JORGE,"What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier."
296697,L642363,u8788,m596,LUCIA,What are you going to do?
296698,L642362,u8786,m596,JORGE,"If you wake first, wake me up."
296699,L642195,u8788,m596,LUCIA,"Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly."
296700,L642194,u8786,m596,JORGE,"So, Ramona!"
296701,L642190,u8788,m596,LUCIA,Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
296702,L642189,u8786,m596,JORGE,"No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion."
296703,L642188,u8788,m596,LUCIA,She's mad.
296704,L642187,u8786,m596,JORGE,It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
296705,L642186,u8788,m596,LUCIA,Why the bad temper?
296706,L642185,u8786,m596,JORGE,Nothing.
296707,L642184,u8788,m596,LUCIA,What's the matter with you?
296708,L642130,u8786,m596,JORGE,Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
296709,L642129,u8788,m596,LUCIA,Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
296710,L642578,u8787,m596,LEPER,"That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch."
296711,L642577,u8786,m596,JORGE,Kill him.
296712,L642576,u8786,m596,JORGE,"Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!"
296713,L642575,u8787,m596,LEPER,Where's the dough?
296714,L642574,u8786,m596,JORGE,I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
296715,L642572,u8786,m596,JORGE,There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
296716,L642571,u8787,m596,LEPER,"Me, rich? Come on!"
296717,L642570,u8786,m596,JORGE,"If you free me, you'll be a rich man ..."
296718,L642569,u8787,m596,LEPER,Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
296719,L642426,u8786,m596,JORGE,That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
296720,L642425,u8795,m596,RAMONA,I don't know -- they've always been there.
296721,L642423,u8786,m596,JORGE,These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
296722,L642422,u8795,m596,RAMONA,You wouldn't be here otherwise.
296723,L642421,u8786,m596,JORGE,Why?
296724,L642420,u8795,m596,RAMONA,I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
296725,L642418,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old."
296726,L642417,u8786,m596,JORGE,And this chest?
296727,L642128,u8786,m596,JORGE,"One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?"
296728,L642127,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"I don't know, sir."
296729,L642126,u8786,m596,JORGE,Why did he kill himself?
296730,L642125,u8795,m596,RAMONA,He was very good. Better than some people would think.
296731,L642406,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Why?
296732,L642405,u8786,m596,JORGE,No.
296733,L642404,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Is she coming back?
296734,L642403,u8786,m596,JORGE,She's left.
296735,L642402,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,And ...your friend?
296736,L642401,u8786,m596,JORGE,"You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere."
296737,L642400,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Yes. Why?
296738,L642399,u8786,m596,JORGE,Do you intend to stay here for some time?
296739,L642398,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I'll be ready.
296740,L642397,u8786,m596,JORGE,Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
296741,L642396,u8786,m596,JORGE,Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
296742,L642395,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Are they going to work here too?
296743,L642339,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day."
296744,L642338,u8786,m596,JORGE,Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
296745,L642337,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth."
296746,L642336,u8786,m596,JORGE,There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
296747,L642335,u8786,m596,JORGE,"They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you."
296748,L642334,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Do they worry you that much, then?"
296749,L642333,u8786,m596,JORGE,You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
296750,L642332,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Leave him alone.
296751,L642331,u8786,m596,JORGE,What are you doing here? Get out.
296752,L642263,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I'm not like you, you have your wife."
296753,L642262,u8786,m596,JORGE,I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
296754,L642261,u8786,m596,JORGE,"And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now."
296755,L642260,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I know that you used to work with an architect.
296756,L642259,u8786,m596,JORGE,What do you know about me?
296757,L642256,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
296758,L642255,u8786,m596,JORGE,But you have a right to let us know what you think.
296759,L642254,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ..."
296760,L642252,u8786,m596,JORGE,"If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you."
296761,L642251,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Well... is it so urgent?
296762,L642250,u8786,m596,JORGE,"It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?"
296763,L642249,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
296764,L642153,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
296765,L642152,u8786,m596,JORGE,"Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service."
296766,L642151,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Are you Jorge?
296767,L642150,u8786,m596,JORGE,Miss Viridiana ...
296768,L642321,u8792,m596,PEASANT,Canelo!
296769,L642320,u8786,m596,JORGE,What's he called?
296770,L642319,u8792,m596,PEASANT,"And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs."
296771,L642316,u8792,m596,PEASANT,"I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you."
296772,L642315,u8786,m596,JORGE,How much do you want for him?
296773,L642314,u8792,m596,PEASANT,"He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed."
296774,L642312,u8792,m596,PEASANT,And let him get run over by somebody else?
296775,L642311,u8786,m596,JORGE,Then let him go and he'll follow you.
296776,L642310,u8792,m596,PEASANT,It's for people!
296777,L642358,u8787,m596,LEPER,He's lying through his ass!
296778,L642357,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Stop this!
296779,L642356,u8787,m596,LEPER,"You'll soon find out, you liar!"
296780,L642354,u8787,m596,LEPER,"Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use."
296781,L642353,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Don't say that.
296782,L642352,u8787,m596,LEPER,"Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!"
296783,L642351,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Are your parents alive?
296784,L642348,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through."
296785,L642347,u8787,m596,LEPER,Things seem to be getting better.
296786,L642346,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,How are you today?
296787,L642234,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!"
296788,L642233,u8787,m596,LEPER,They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
296789,L642231,u8787,m596,LEPER,They told me it isn't at the hospital.
296790,L642230,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Are you sure it isn't contagious?
296791,L642229,u8787,m596,LEPER,"They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them."
296792,L642083,u8789,m596,MAYOR,Come with me.
296793,L642082,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Where?
296794,L642081,u8789,m596,MAYOR,There's been an accident.
296795,L642080,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Why not?
296796,L642079,u8789,m596,MAYOR,You cannot leave ...
296797,L642078,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?"
296798,L642077,u8789,m596,MAYOR,"How do you do, Miss Viridiana!"
296799,L642086,u8796,m596,RITA,Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
296800,L642085,u8790,m596,MONCHO,I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
296801,L642014,u8790,m596,MONCHO,You little liar! Get out of here!
296802,L642013,u8796,m596,RITA,He came in through the cupboard.
296803,L642011,u8790,m596,MONCHO,"He couldn't get through the door, then?"
296804,L642010,u8796,m596,RITA,"Yes -- very, very big!"
296805,L642009,u8790,m596,MONCHO,"Very, very?"
296806,L642008,u8796,m596,RITA,It's a very big one.
296807,L642007,u8790,m596,MONCHO,A black bull!
296808,L642006,u8796,m596,RITA,A black bull came.
296809,L642005,u8790,m596,MONCHO,Don't invent stories; go to bed.
296810,L642004,u8796,m596,RITA,I'm afraid.
296811,L642003,u8790,m596,MONCHO,Why are you crying?
296812,L642411,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?"
296813,L642410,u8790,m596,MONCHO,Yes!
296814,L642409,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"You have decided to leave, Moncho."
296815,L642170,u8790,m596,MONCHO,"But, miss ..."
296816,L642169,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here."
296817,L642163,u8790,m596,MONCHO,This louse is looking for trouble.
296818,L642162,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"What's going on, Moncho?"
296819,L642145,u8790,m596,MONCHO,They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
296820,L642144,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
296821,L642108,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You are forgiven. Goodbye.
296822,L642107,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Forgive me if I have offended you.
296823,L642102,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
296824,L642101,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent."
296825,L642100,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
296826,L642095,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
296827,L642094,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I had so many things to think about!
296828,L642093,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,"Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately."
296829,L642091,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Mother.
296830,L642090,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,"Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?"
296831,L641852,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
296832,L641851,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to..."
296833,L641850,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,"He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?"
296834,L641849,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
296835,L641848,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
296836,L641847,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I don't want to leave the convent, Mother."
296837,L641846,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
296838,L641845,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him."
296839,L641843,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"All right, Mother."
296840,L641842,u8791,m596,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
296841,L641841,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Mother?
296842,L642175,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody."
296843,L642174,u8793,m596,PELON,I've had a gutful of this.
296844,L642173,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
296845,L642166,u8793,m596,PELON,I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
296846,L642165,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Don't talk like that!
296847,L642117,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Good, then let's go!"
296848,L642116,u8793,m596,PELON,"When you are, miss."
296849,L642115,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?"
296850,L642360,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper."
296851,L642359,u8794,m596,POCA,"Ask the priest, miss."
296852,L642273,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
296853,L642272,u8794,m596,POCA,She looks like a sick marrow!
296854,L642222,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that."
296855,L642221,u8794,m596,POCA,I'm only good at making people laugh.
296856,L642220,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"What about you, Manuel?"
296857,L642119,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them."
296858,L642118,u8794,m596,POCA,She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
296859,L642034,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"Oh, you slept well; don't worry."
296860,L642033,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Have I slept long?
296861,L642032,u8795,m596,RAMONA,You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
296862,L642031,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,What happened to me?
296863,L642030,u8795,m596,RAMONA,That will soon pass. It's nothing.
296864,L642029,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I have a headache.
296865,L642028,u8795,m596,RAMONA,How do you feel?
296866,L641860,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Ah! Pleased to meet you.
296867,L641859,u8795,m596,RAMONA,"Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant."
296868,L641911,u8796,m596,RITA,"No, I don't want to."
296869,L641910,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
296870,L641909,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
296871,L641908,u8796,m596,RITA,From the terrace.
296872,L641907,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,How did you see me?
296873,L641904,u8796,m596,RITA,"Yes, yes, I saw you!"
296874,L641903,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,What?
296875,L641893,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
296876,L641892,u8796,m596,RITA,"Today, a good girl."
296877,L641891,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,"Good morning, Rita. How are we today?"
296878,L641858,u8797,m596,VIRIDIANA,Hello.
296879,L641857,u8796,m596,RITA,Hello.
296880,L643258,u8803,m597,PARKER,Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
296881,L643257,u8798,m597,ALEXIEV,I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
296882,L643256,u8803,m597,PARKER,"I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else."
296883,L643255,u8798,m597,ALEXIEV,Me? What did I do?
296884,L643254,u8803,m597,PARKER,"You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you."
296885,L642993,u8798,m597,ALEXIEV,"Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful."
296886,L642992,u8803,m597,PARKER,It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
296887,L642991,u8798,m597,ALEXIEV,It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
296888,L642990,u8798,m597,ALEXIEV,I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
296889,L642989,u8803,m597,PARKER,"In English, please."
296890,L642881,u8798,m597,ALEXIEV,") There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it."
296891,L642880,u8803,m597,PARKER,Can you tell us what's on the disc?
296892,L642879,u8798,m597,ALEXIEV,") Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies..."
296893,L643084,u8800,m597,DEANE,"You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?"
296894,L643083,u8799,m597,COX,Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
296895,L643082,u8800,m597,DEANE,"He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?"
296896,L643081,u8799,m597,COX,Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
296897,L642900,u8800,m597,DEANE,I wish we could hear them.
296898,L642899,u8799,m597,COX,I don't know.
296899,L642898,u8800,m597,DEANE,Why would they be going there?
296900,L642897,u8799,m597,COX,Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
296901,L642896,u8800,m597,DEANE,What are they doing in Los Feliz?
296902,L642786,u8800,m597,DEANE,But only you will know he's not human.
296903,L642785,u8799,m597,COX,There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
296904,L642784,u8800,m597,DEANE,"Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?"
296905,L642783,u8799,m597,COX,"If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself."
296906,L642782,u8800,m597,DEANE,This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
296907,L642778,u8800,m597,DEANE,Catch him and your record's clean.
296908,L642777,u8799,m597,COX,Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
296909,L642771,u8799,m597,COX,Whatever.
296910,L642770,u8800,m597,DEANE,You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
296911,L642769,u8799,m597,COX,"We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android."
296912,L642627,u8800,m597,DEANE,Why wasn't I told?
296913,L642626,u8799,m597,COX,My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
296914,L643121,u8803,m597,PARKER,"If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself."
296915,L643120,u8799,m597,COX,"On my life, I promise you I will."
296916,L643119,u8803,m597,PARKER,"When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?"
296917,L643112,u8803,m597,PARKER,Then I guess we're even.
296918,L643111,u8799,m597,COX,"She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did."
296919,L643108,u8803,m597,PARKER,You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
296920,L643107,u8799,m597,COX,"Don't worry, they have no idea where you are."
296921,L642815,u8803,m597,PARKER,Where's my gun?
296922,L642814,u8799,m597,COX,Sid 6.7 is now armed.
296923,L642813,u8803,m597,PARKER,Their weapons missing?
296924,L642812,u8799,m597,COX,Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
296925,L642811,u8799,m597,COX,Fine  you want to stay here?
296926,L642810,u8803,m597,PARKER,"She wasn't part of the deal, Cox."
296927,L642809,u8799,m597,COX,"This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use."
296928,L642808,u8803,m597,PARKER,What she's going to do is get in my way.
296929,L642807,u8799,m597,COX,She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
296930,L642773,u8799,m597,COX,If you can catch him.
296931,L642772,u8803,m597,PARKER,Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
296932,L642768,u8799,m597,COX,Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
296933,L642767,u8803,m597,PARKER,I've seen worse.
296934,L642766,u8799,m597,COX,"These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?"
296935,L642762,u8803,m597,PARKER,It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
296936,L642761,u8799,m597,COX,"Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane."
296937,L642760,u8803,m597,PARKER,You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
296938,L642650,u8803,m597,PARKER,Do me a favor  keep sending them.
296939,L642649,u8799,m597,COX,What about them?
296940,L642648,u8803,m597,PARKER,You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
296941,L642647,u8799,m597,COX,"Don't give up, Parker. Not ever."
296942,L642646,u8803,m597,PARKER,"But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days."
296943,L642643,u8803,m597,PARKER,I'm getting by.
296944,L642642,u8799,m597,COX,"Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?"
296945,L642641,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?"
296946,L642640,u8799,m597,COX,You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
296947,L642639,u8803,m597,PARKER,He was a computer program for crissake.
296948,L642638,u8799,m597,COX,What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
296949,L642637,u8799,m597,COX,"Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,"
296950,L642636,u8803,m597,PARKER,Why'd.. .you pull me out?
296951,L642635,u8799,m597,COX,You all right?
296952,L643096,u8802,m597,MADISON,Got it.
296953,L643095,u8799,m597,COX,"Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach."
296954,L643093,u8802,m597,MADISON,I don't set policy.  You have the key?
296955,L643092,u8799,m597,COX,Why didn't anybody tell me?!
296956,L643091,u8802,m597,MADISON,I need your help--
296957,L643090,u8799,m597,COX,I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
296958,L643089,u8802,m597,MADISON,There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
296959,L643069,u8802,m597,MADISON,"Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming."
296960,L643068,u8799,m597,COX,You think he's smart?
296961,L643067,u8802,m597,MADISON,I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
296962,L643066,u8799,m597,COX,"Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?"
296963,L643065,u8802,m597,MADISON,I should have told him.
296964,L642980,u8799,m597,COX,"In other words, we collectively don't know shit."
296965,L642979,u8802,m597,MADISON,"Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure."
296966,L642978,u8799,m597,COX,"None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?"
296967,L642977,u8802,m597,MADISON,Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
296968,L642976,u8799,m597,COX,... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
296969,L642804,u8800,m597,DEANE,"I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you."
296970,L642803,u8802,m597,MADISON,"The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again."
296971,L642802,u8800,m597,DEANE,Not if you're with him every step of the way.
296972,L642801,u8802,m597,MADISON,"Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous."
296973,L642800,u8800,m597,DEANE,"That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?"
296974,L642790,u8800,m597,DEANE,You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
296975,L642789,u8802,m597,MADISON,What's the assignment?
296976,L642788,u8800,m597,DEANE,"We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment."
296977,L642787,u8802,m597,MADISON,"Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?"
296978,L643244,u8800,m597,DEANE,"Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell."
296979,L643243,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?"
296980,L643242,u8800,m597,DEANE,This better not be a wild goose chase.
296981,L643241,u8803,m597,PARKER,You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
296982,L643240,u8800,m597,DEANE,You know how much man power you're talking about?
296983,L643239,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena."
296984,L643238,u8800,m597,DEANE,Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
296985,L643237,u8803,m597,PARKER,"If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel."
296986,L643236,u8800,m597,DEANE,Enough to level an entire city block.
296987,L643235,u8803,m597,PARKER,"No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?"
296988,L643234,u8800,m597,DEANE,It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
296989,L643233,u8803,m597,PARKER,Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
296990,L643232,u8800,m597,DEANE,What did you find out?
296991,L643231,u8803,m597,PARKER,Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
296992,L643230,u8800,m597,DEANE,"Barnes, where the hell have you been?!"
296993,L642781,u8803,m597,PARKER,How do you know I won't run?
296994,L642780,u8800,m597,DEANE,"If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence."
296995,L642779,u8803,m597,PARKER,What happens if I can't catch him?
296996,L642776,u8800,m597,DEANE,This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
296997,L642775,u8803,m597,PARKER,Not from in here.
296998,L642774,u8800,m597,DEANE,Think you can do it?
296999,L642765,u8800,m597,DEANE,Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
297000,L642764,u8803,m597,PARKER,Only because I got pulled out early.
297001,L642763,u8800,m597,DEANE,"I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive."
297002,L642982,u8800,m597,DEANE,"Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage."
297003,L642981,u8806,m597,WALLACE,It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
297004,L642623,u8806,m597,WALLACE,I was assured the problem was corrected.
297005,L642622,u8800,m597,DEANE,"Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world."
297006,L642621,u8806,m597,WALLACE,"Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real."
297007,L642620,u8800,m597,DEANE,What the hell happened?
297008,L642618,u8800,m597,DEANE,Don't remind me.
297009,L642617,u8806,m597,WALLACE,"Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?"
297010,L642616,u8800,m597,DEANE,What did Cox pull him out early for?
297011,L642668,u8806,m597,WALLACE,"As a matter of fact, I do."
297012,L642667,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,He hears...everything.
297013,L642666,u8806,m597,WALLACE,How does he know who I am?
297014,L642664,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,I understand... I understand perfectly.
297015,L642663,u8806,m597,WALLACE,"You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?"
297016,L642662,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,I'M WHAT?!
297017,L642661,u8806,m597,WALLACE,"You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired."
297018,L642660,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,I'm still making adjustments...
297019,L642659,u8806,m597,WALLACE,Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
297020,L642658,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
297021,L642657,u8806,m597,WALLACE,You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
297022,L642747,u8804,m597,REILLY,What I need is a nymphomaniac.
297023,L642746,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,You need a maid.
297024,L642743,u8804,m597,REILLY,"I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you..."
297025,L642742,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,"Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is."
297026,L642741,u8804,m597,REILLY,"... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones."
297027,L642740,u8804,m597,REILLY,Separate the character module from the neural net...
297028,L642739,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,How do you kill it?
297029,L642738,u8804,m597,REILLY,"As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away."
297030,L642737,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,This is supposed to be years away.
297031,L642736,u8804,m597,REILLY,It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
297032,L642735,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,It feels so.. .real.
297033,L642734,u8804,m597,REILLY,Coordinated by polymer neural net.
297034,L642733,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,"It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules..."
297035,L642732,u8804,m597,REILLY,Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
297036,L642731,u8804,m597,REILLY,You're...such a wimp.
297037,L642730,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,Get that fucking thing away from me!
297038,L642727,u8804,m597,REILLY,"Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back."
297039,L642726,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,Do I get to see it or not?
297040,L642725,u8804,m597,REILLY,I haven't been working on anything.
297041,L642724,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
297042,L642723,u8804,m597,REILLY,HEY!!!
297043,L643184,u8802,m597,MADISON,Then fix it.
297044,L643183,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,"If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR."
297045,L643182,u8802,m597,MADISON,Talk so I can understand.
297046,L643181,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
297047,L643176,u8802,m597,MADISON,Turn it down!
297048,L643175,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,I wonder how that...
297049,L643174,u8802,m597,MADISON,Show me his physical sensory level.
297050,L643173,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,How should I know?
297051,L643172,u8802,m597,MADISON,What's wrong with Parker?
297052,L643171,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,"I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world."
297053,L643215,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever..."
297054,L643214,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
297055,L643213,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
297056,L643211,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,Glad to...
297057,L643210,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,Help me get out of here.
297058,L643209,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?"
297059,L643208,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,Of course you are.
297060,L643207,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"I am beautiful, aren't I?"
297061,L642754,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"What do you expect me to do, thank him?"
297062,L642753,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,SID  NO!!!
297063,L642745,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,I think I understand what you have in mind...
297064,L642744,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,You catching my drift?
297065,L642729,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,All my work is my finest.
297066,L642728,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"She's some of your finest work, Daryl."
297067,L642698,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?"
297068,L642697,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,"What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?"
297069,L642696,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away."
297070,L642695,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,My God...
297071,L642694,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive."
297072,L642693,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,"You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!"
297073,L642692,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"It was me, what?"
297074,L642691,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,"It was you, wasn't it?"
297075,L642690,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
297076,L642689,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
297077,L642656,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,Think hard -- it'll come to you...
297078,L642655,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,Should I have?
297079,L642654,u8801,m597,LINDENMEYER,Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
297080,L642653,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"Don't be angry with me, Daryl."
297081,L643284,u8803,m597,PARKER,You won't want to watch. Turn around.
297082,L643283,u8802,m597,MADISON,What do we do now?
297083,L643281,u8802,m597,MADISON,Duck!
297084,L643280,u8803,m597,PARKER,Then shoot him already.
297085,L643279,u8802,m597,MADISON,I couldn't tell you.
297086,L643278,u8803,m597,PARKER,How's your pulse?
297087,L643260,u8802,m597,MADISON,Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
297088,L643259,u8803,m597,PARKER,Where the hell are you going?
297089,L643227,u8802,m597,MADISON,I don't know.
297090,L643226,u8803,m597,PARKER,Sid?
297091,L643225,u8802,m597,MADISON,My guess is dead.
297092,L643224,u8803,m597,PARKER,Lindenmeyer?
297093,L643223,u8802,m597,MADISON,More or less.
297094,L643222,u8803,m597,PARKER,...I think so...You?
297095,L643221,u8802,m597,MADISON,You okay?
297096,L643163,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7."
297097,L643162,u8802,m597,MADISON,That's why I'm asking.
297098,L643161,u8803,m597,PARKER,You don't know?
297099,L643160,u8802,m597,MADISON,You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
297100,L643159,u8803,m597,PARKER,You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
297101,L643158,u8802,m597,MADISON,Can I ask you something?
297102,L643156,u8803,m597,PARKER,"A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where."
297103,L643155,u8802,m597,MADISON,Find out anything?
297104,L643136,u8802,m597,MADISON,Thanks.
297105,L643135,u8803,m597,PARKER,Nice work.
297106,L643134,u8802,m597,MADISON,I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
297107,L643133,u8803,m597,PARKER,See something?
297108,L643132,u8802,m597,MADISON,"That, or living through him..."
297109,L643131,u8803,m597,PARKER,Think he's keeping track of his creation?
297110,L643130,u8802,m597,MADISON,"If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind."
297111,L643129,u8803,m597,PARKER,Part of him is.
297112,L643128,u8802,m597,MADISON,Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
297113,L643127,u8803,m597,PARKER,"I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious."
297114,L643126,u8802,m597,MADISON,"The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?"
297115,L643117,u8802,m597,MADISON,I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
297116,L643116,u8803,m597,PARKER,"I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?"
297117,L643115,u8802,m597,MADISON,You're not capable of it.
297118,L643114,u8803,m597,PARKER,Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
297119,L643113,u8802,m597,MADISON,How did you find out about the toxin?
297120,L643110,u8803,m597,PARKER,You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
297121,L643109,u8802,m597,MADISON,He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
297122,L643105,u8803,m597,PARKER,"They're going to fry me for it, anyway."
297123,L643104,u8802,m597,MADISON,We know you didn't kill those guards.
297124,L643055,u8802,m597,MADISON,No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
297125,L643054,u8803,m597,PARKER,Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
297126,L643043,u8803,m597,PARKER,"If you're gonna do it, better do it now."
297127,L643042,u8802,m597,MADISON,Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
297128,L643031,u8803,m597,PARKER,Both.
297129,L643030,u8802,m597,MADISON,Which way?
297130,L643029,u8803,m597,PARKER,Authority still makes me nervous.
297131,L643028,u8802,m597,MADISON,"You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?"
297132,L643027,u8803,m597,PARKER,Real effective security...
297133,L643012,u8803,m597,PARKER,You like baseball?
297134,L643011,u8802,m597,MADISON,"It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media."
297135,L643005,u8802,m597,MADISON,"I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished..."
297136,L643004,u8803,m597,PARKER,Start of what?
297137,L643003,u8802,m597,MADISON,Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
297138,L642975,u8802,m597,MADISON,I'm doing the best I can!
297139,L642974,u8803,m597,PARKER,What's the problem?
297140,L642955,u8803,m597,PARKER,Tell him.
297141,L642954,u8802,m597,MADISON,"This isn't a game, Parker!"
297142,L642953,u8803,m597,PARKER,You know I am.
297143,L642952,u8802,m597,MADISON,Enjoying yourself?
297144,L642951,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?"
297145,L642950,u8803,m597,PARKER,Nothing.
297146,L642949,u8802,m597,MADISON,What did you do to those people?
297147,L642948,u8803,m597,PARKER,This is my area of expertise.
297148,L642947,u8802,m597,MADISON,What the hell's going on?!
297149,L642939,u8803,m597,PARKER,Stop me.
297150,L642938,u8802,m597,MADISON,Don't get out of the car.
297151,L642934,u8803,m597,PARKER,Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
297152,L642933,u8802,m597,MADISON,I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
297153,L642932,u8803,m597,PARKER,Relax. I know what you meant.
297154,L642931,u8802,m597,MADISON,"Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I..."
297155,L642930,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Don't worry about it, all right?"
297156,L642929,u8802,m597,MADISON,"You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant..."
297157,L642928,u8803,m597,PARKER,I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
297158,L642924,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee."
297159,L642923,u8802,m597,MADISON,"What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before."
297160,L642922,u8803,m597,PARKER,Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
297161,L642921,u8802,m597,MADISON,"Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve."
297162,L642920,u8803,m597,PARKER,What does that mean?
297163,L642919,u8802,m597,MADISON,Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
297164,L642918,u8803,m597,PARKER,You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
297165,L642917,u8802,m597,MADISON,"I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes."
297166,L642916,u8803,m597,PARKER,Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
297167,L642915,u8802,m597,MADISON,Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
297168,L642914,u8803,m597,PARKER,"She's beautiful, you know?"
297169,L642913,u8802,m597,MADISON,I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
297170,L642912,u8803,m597,PARKER,Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
297171,L642910,u8802,m597,MADISON,How did you get your hand out?
297172,L642909,u8803,m597,PARKER,Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
297173,L642906,u8802,m597,MADISON,And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
297174,L642905,u8803,m597,PARKER,Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
297175,L642904,u8802,m597,MADISON,Give me your wrist.
297176,L642878,u8802,m597,MADISON,"In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick..."
297177,L642877,u8803,m597,PARKER,What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
297178,L642876,u8802,m597,MADISON,Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
297179,L642875,u8803,m597,PARKER,Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
297180,L642874,u8802,m597,MADISON,"As a matter of fact, it is."
297181,L642873,u8803,m597,PARKER,"This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you."
297182,L642870,u8802,m597,MADISON,"But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones."
297183,L642869,u8803,m597,PARKER,Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
297184,L642868,u8802,m597,MADISON,Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
297185,L642867,u8802,m597,MADISON,He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
297186,L642866,u8803,m597,PARKER,Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
297187,L642865,u8802,m597,MADISON,Who said that?
297188,L642864,u8803,m597,PARKER,"For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ."
297189,L642863,u8802,m597,MADISON,I am impressed.
297190,L642862,u8803,m597,PARKER,"... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977."
297191,L642861,u8802,m597,MADISON,I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
297192,L642860,u8803,m597,PARKER,Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
297193,L642859,u8802,m597,MADISON,The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
297194,L642858,u8803,m597,PARKER,"I've been in prison, remember?"
297195,L642857,u8802,m597,MADISON,Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
297196,L642856,u8802,m597,MADISON,I'm still working on it.
297197,L642855,u8803,m597,PARKER,I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
297198,L642854,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him..."
297199,L642853,u8802,m597,MADISON,This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
297200,L642852,u8803,m597,PARKER,"You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?"
297201,L642851,u8802,m597,MADISON,"Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?"
297202,L642850,u8803,m597,PARKER,What are you doing?
297203,L642848,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it."
297204,L642847,u8802,m597,MADISON,You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
297205,L642840,u8802,m597,MADISON,Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
297206,L642839,u8803,m597,PARKER,What happened when he was 17?
297207,L642838,u8802,m597,MADISON,He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
297208,L642837,u8803,m597,PARKER,Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
297209,L642835,u8803,m597,PARKER,I know who would know.
297210,L642834,u8802,m597,MADISON,"I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?"
297211,L642833,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends."
297212,L642832,u8802,m597,MADISON,Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
297213,L642831,u8803,m597,PARKER,Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
297214,L642830,u8802,m597,MADISON,He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
297215,L642827,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody."
297216,L642826,u8802,m597,MADISON,You ready for this?
297217,L642823,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar."
297218,L642822,u8802,m597,MADISON,You all right?
297219,L642821,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it."
297220,L642820,u8802,m597,MADISON,It wasn't a lie.
297221,L642819,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie."
297222,L642806,u8802,m597,MADISON,What you need is a collar.
297223,L642805,u8803,m597,PARKER,I don't need a babysitter.
297224,L642720,u8803,m597,PARKER,I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
297225,L642719,u8802,m597,MADISON,I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
297226,L642717,u8803,m597,PARKER,Enough!
297227,L642716,u8802,m597,MADISON,"It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved."
297228,L642715,u8803,m597,PARKER,Go to hell.
297229,L642714,u8802,m597,MADISON,"You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target..."
297230,L642713,u8803,m597,PARKER,Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
297231,L642712,u8802,m597,MADISON,What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
297232,L642711,u8803,m597,PARKER,"If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence."
297233,L642710,u8802,m597,MADISON,"That's not true, Parker."
297234,L642709,u8803,m597,PARKER,You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
297235,L642708,u8802,m597,MADISON,"I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation."
297236,L642707,u8803,m597,PARKER,John died.
297237,L642706,u8802,m597,MADISON,"In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?"
297238,L642705,u8803,m597,PARKER,A little less than yesterday.
297239,L642704,u8802,m597,MADISON,"No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?"
297240,L642703,u8803,m597,PARKER,You actually listen to all those tapes?
297241,L643276,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!"
297242,L643275,u8803,m597,PARKER,"Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?"
297243,L643201,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!"
297244,L643200,u8803,m597,PARKER,What are you talking about?
297245,L643199,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport."
297246,L643198,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly."
297247,L643197,u8803,m597,PARKER,Aren't you going to watch with me?
297248,L643196,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
297249,L643195,u8803,m597,PARKER,You are going after Mayor Bennett.
297250,L643194,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,There you go  best seat in the house.
297251,L643191,u8803,m597,PARKER,I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
297252,L643190,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
297253,L643169,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,My...secret.
297254,L643168,u8803,m597,PARKER,You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
297255,L643167,u8803,m597,PARKER,Where did you plant the C-4?!
297256,L643166,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
297257,L643165,u8803,m597,PARKER,What C-4...was Cox talking about?
297258,L643154,u8803,m597,PARKER,Where did you plant the C-4?!
297259,L643153,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
297260,L643152,u8803,m597,PARKER,What C-4...was Cox talking about?
297261,L643143,u8803,m597,PARKER,Why's that?
297262,L643142,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
297263,L643077,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me."
297264,L643076,u8803,m597,PARKER,DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
297265,L643075,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?"
297266,L643074,u8803,m597,PARKER,"GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!"
297267,L643073,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends."
297268,L643072,u8803,m597,PARKER,You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
297269,L642963,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
297270,L642962,u8803,m597,PARKER,You and me have nothing in common.
297271,L642961,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,"I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends."
297272,L642960,u8803,m597,PARKER,The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
297273,L642959,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,The symphony of collision...
297274,L642609,u8805,m597,SID 6.7,Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
297275,L642608,u8803,m597,PARKER,Where's John?
297276,L642688,u8804,m597,REILLY,"At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?"
297277,L642687,u8806,m597,WALLACE,Do they have to look so...robotic?
297278,L642686,u8804,m597,REILLY,"Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow."
297279,L642685,u8806,m597,WALLACE,"As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month."

298059,L645227,u8830,m599,BUD,"Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch."
298060,L644927,u8830,m599,BUD,"I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you."
298061,L644926,u8838,m599,LYNCH,"Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?"
298062,L644771,u8838,m599,LYNCH,Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
298063,L644770,u8830,m599,BUD,"I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history..."
298064,L644769,u8838,m599,LYNCH,"Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales."
298065,L644768,u8830,m599,BUD,"Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!"
298066,L644767,u8838,m599,LYNCH,"If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it."
298067,L644766,u8838,m599,LYNCH,"Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome."
298068,L644765,u8830,m599,BUD,He's lying.
298069,L644763,u8838,m599,LYNCH,"Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?"
298070,L644762,u8830,m599,BUD,... That's what you told us to say.
298071,L645223,u8830,m599,BUD,"...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day."

298074,L645035,u8830,m599,BUD,...you take that Anacott Steel?
298075,L645034,u8833,m599,CHARLIE,"You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client..."
298076,L645033,u8830,m599,BUD,Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
298077,L644784,u8830,m599,BUD,"Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin."
298078,L644783,u8833,m599,CHARLIE,"Buddy boy, how ya doing?"
298079,L644745,u8830,m599,BUD,"...not that you learned anything, Chunk."
298080,L644744,u8833,m599,CHARLIE,"...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor."
298081,L644743,u8830,m599,BUD,"...if I had your looks, better."
298082,L644742,u8833,m599,CHARLIE,"...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?"
298083,L644741,u8830,m599,BUD,"...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?"
298084,L645489,u8830,m599,BUD,Now! Tell everyone to dump!

298087,L645486,u8840,m599,MARV,The stock's going to Pluto!
298088,L645475,u8840,m599,MARV,"Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders."
298089,L645474,u8830,m599,BUD,"I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it."
298090,L645473,u8840,m599,MARV,I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
298091,L645355,u8830,m599,BUD,Get the hell out!
298092,L645354,u8840,m599,MARV,"You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours."
298093,L645353,u8830,m599,BUD,Then get out and close it behind you.
298094,L645352,u8840,m599,MARV,Hey the door was open.
298095,L645351,u8830,m599,BUD,Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
298096,L645350,u8840,m599,MARV,"Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: ""Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe."" Yuk yuk."
298097,L645216,u8840,m599,MARV,Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
298098,L645215,u8830,m599,BUD,What's going on?
298099,L645024,u8830,m599,BUD,Anacott Steel. Buy it.
298100,L645023,u8840,m599,MARV,What the hell...
298101,L644923,u8840,m599,MARV,"That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton."
298102,L644922,u8830,m599,BUD,"All right, I owe you one Marv."
298103,L644921,u8840,m599,MARV,"Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?"
298104,L644920,u8830,m599,BUD,"Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality..."
298105,L644919,u8840,m599,MARV,"Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar."
298106,L644896,u8830,m599,BUD,"Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!"
298107,L644895,u8840,m599,MARV,"Got a little action there, eh buddy?"
298108,L644890,u8830,m599,BUD,"Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today."
298109,L644889,u8840,m599,MARV,"Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?"
298110,L644887,u8840,m599,MARV,"Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there."
298111,L644886,u8830,m599,BUD,...gotta read my reports.
298112,L644885,u8840,m599,MARV,"...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?"
298113,L644881,u8840,m599,MARV,Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
298114,L644880,u8830,m599,BUD,"Yeah, but he didn't see me."
298115,L644879,u8840,m599,MARV,"...well, see him?"
298116,L644780,u8830,m599,BUD,"Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life."
298117,L644779,u8840,m599,MARV,It concerns his future!
298118,L644778,u8830,m599,BUD,"Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?"
298119,L644777,u8840,m599,MARV,"Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short."
298120,L644776,u8840,m599,MARV,Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
298121,L644775,u8830,m599,BUD,"Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone..."
298122,L644774,u8840,m599,MARV,"Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie."
298123,L644773,u8830,m599,BUD,"Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me."
298124,L644772,u8840,m599,MARV,"Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today."
298125,L644750,u8830,m599,BUD,"Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare."
298126,L644749,u8840,m599,MARV,"Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest."
298127,L644748,u8830,m599,BUD,Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
298128,L644747,u8840,m599,MARV,"Yeah, where's your machine gun."
298129,L644746,u8830,m599,BUD,"I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv."
298130,L645549,u8831,m599,CARL,"Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others..."
298131,L645548,u8830,m599,BUD,"Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it."
298132,L645544,u8830,m599,BUD,"Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral."
298133,L645543,u8831,m599,CARL,I guess it's time to hit the road.
298134,L645542,u8830,m599,BUD,"No, thanks, I'm nervous enough."
298135,L645541,u8831,m599,CARL,Another cup of coffee?
298136,L645435,u8831,m599,CARL,"You speak for me, son."
298137,L645434,u8830,m599,BUD,"Your words, not mine..."
298138,L645332,u8830,m599,BUD,"Your men! All my life ""your men"" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?"
298139,L645331,u8831,m599,CARL,"I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!"
298140,L645330,u8830,m599,BUD,"Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please."
298141,L645329,u8831,m599,CARL,"...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent..."
298142,L645328,u8831,m599,CARL,"Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father."
298143,L645327,u8830,m599,BUD,That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
298144,L645326,u8831,m599,CARL,"What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet."
298145,L645325,u8830,m599,BUD,"No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself."
298146,L645324,u8831,m599,CARL,"He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it."
298147,L645290,u8831,m599,CARL,I met them before you were born.
298148,L645289,u8830,m599,BUD,"Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants..."
298149,L645021,u8830,m599,BUD,"...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?"
298150,L645020,u8831,m599,CARL,"Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here."
298151,L645019,u8830,m599,BUD,Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
298152,L645018,u8831,m599,CARL,Whatever night you like.
298153,L645017,u8830,m599,BUD,"... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?"
298154,L645016,u8831,m599,CARL,Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
298155,L645014,u8831,m599,CARL,What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
298156,L645013,u8830,m599,BUD,Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
298157,L645012,u8831,m599,CARL,...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
298158,L645011,u8830,m599,BUD,Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
298159,L645010,u8831,m599,CARL,Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
298160,L645008,u8831,m599,CARL,Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
298161,L645007,u8830,m599,BUD,Alright. Why so pissed?
298162,L645006,u8831,m599,CARL,"Don't start, alright."
298163,L645005,u8830,m599,BUD,"Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the..."
298164,L645004,u8831,m599,CARL,What brings you out here...
298165,L644821,u8831,m599,CARL,"Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that."
298166,L644820,u8830,m599,BUD,The FAA announcement.
298167,L644819,u8831,m599,CARL,About what?
298168,L644818,u8830,m599,BUD,You sure about this FAA announcement?
298169,L644817,u8830,m599,BUD,"Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad..."
298170,L644816,u8831,m599,CARL,"Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now."
298171,L644815,u8830,m599,BUD,That's great Dad.
298172,L644814,u8831,m599,CARL,"...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right."
298173,L644813,u8830,m599,BUD,...Work okay?
298174,L644812,u8831,m599,CARL,"...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it."
298175,L644811,u8830,m599,BUD,How's Mom?
298176,L644810,u8831,m599,CARL,"... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow..."
298177,L644809,u8830,m599,BUD,Not in here Dad... please. Later.
298178,L644808,u8831,m599,CARL,"...Got a 100 on me, you..."
298179,L644807,u8830,m599,BUD,"Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise."
298180,L644806,u8831,m599,CARL,"It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?"
298181,L644805,u8830,m599,BUD,"It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see..."
298182,L644804,u8831,m599,CARL,"So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you..."
298183,L644803,u8830,m599,BUD,"50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes..."
298184,L644802,u8831,m599,CARL,"I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?"
298185,L644801,u8830,m599,BUD,"Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline."
298186,L644800,u8831,m599,CARL,"You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman."
298187,L644799,u8830,m599,BUD,"Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm."
298188,L644798,u8831,m599,CARL,"you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman."
298189,L644797,u8830,m599,BUD,Coulda been a contender.
298190,L644796,u8831,m599,CARL,"I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,"
298191,L644795,u8830,m599,BUD,D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
298192,L644794,u8831,m599,CARL,Speak English will ya.
298193,L644793,u8830,m599,BUD,"Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss."
298194,L644792,u8831,m599,CARL,"... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me."
298195,L644790,u8830,m599,BUD,"It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date."
298196,L644789,u8831,m599,CARL,...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
298197,L644878,u8841,m599,NATALIE,"...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on."
298198,L644877,u8830,m599,BUD,...thanks Natalie.
298199,L644829,u8841,m599,NATALIE,"Stay here, I'll see what I can do."
298200,L644828,u8830,m599,BUD,"It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get."
298201,L644827,u8841,m599,NATALIE,"First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?"
298202,L644826,u8830,m599,BUD,...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
298203,L644825,u8841,m599,NATALIE,What are you doing here?
298204,L644824,u8830,m599,BUD,"Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me..."
298205,L645349,u8830,m599,BUD,Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
298206,L645348,u8835,m599,DIXON,I don't know anything!
298207,L645347,u8830,m599,BUD,"Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing."
298208,L645346,u8835,m599,DIXON,You sure?
298209,L645345,u8830,m599,BUD,They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
298210,L645344,u8835,m599,DIXON,What if they call him?
298211,L645343,u8830,m599,BUD,Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
298212,L645342,u8835,m599,DIXON,What if he asks where I got the money?
298213,L645341,u8830,m599,BUD,"Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment."
298214,L645340,u8835,m599,DIXON,"I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into..."
298215,L645339,u8830,m599,BUD,What'd you tell him?
298216,L645338,u8835,m599,DIXON,"...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought..."
298217,L645252,u8830,m599,BUD,"No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made..."
298218,L645251,u8835,m599,DIXON,"Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?"
298219,L644959,u8830,m599,BUD,It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
298220,L644958,u8837,m599,LISA,So you're hot on this stock?
298221,L644957,u8830,m599,BUD,"Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share."
298222,L644956,u8830,m599,BUD,"Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield..."
298223,L644955,u8837,m599,LISA,I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
298224,L644954,u8830,m599,BUD,Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
298225,L644953,u8837,m599,LISA,Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
298226,L644952,u8837,m599,LISA,"Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite."
298227,L644951,u8830,m599,BUD,"So, where are we going?"
298228,L644950,u8830,m599,BUD,We are?
298229,L644949,u8837,m599,LISA,"Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out."
298230,L644948,u8830,m599,BUD,"Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?"
298231,L644947,u8837,m599,LISA,"Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's."
298232,L645364,u8843,m599,ROGER,"You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on."
298233,L645363,u8830,m599,BUD,He never told me...
298234,L645362,u8843,m599,ROGER,"Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?"
298235,L645360,u8830,m599,BUD,"Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool."
298236,L645359,u8843,m599,ROGER,"Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright..."
298237,L645358,u8830,m599,BUD,"....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this..."
298238,L645357,u8843,m599,ROGER,"...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy..."
298239,L645356,u8830,m599,BUD,So what's the problem?
298240,L645254,u8843,m599,ROGER,"All right, Bud... let's do it."
298241,L645253,u8830,m599,BUD,"...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger."
298242,L645164,u8843,m599,ROGER,Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
298243,L645163,u8830,m599,BUD,"More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?"
298244,L645162,u8843,m599,ROGER,"...and if I did, what's in it for moi?"
298245,L645161,u8830,m599,BUD,"Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know."
298246,L645160,u8843,m599,ROGER,"Yeah, right..."
298247,L645159,u8830,m599,BUD,Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
298248,L645158,u8843,m599,ROGER,"Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?"
298249,L645157,u8830,m599,BUD,"What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?"
298250,L645156,u8843,m599,ROGER,Okay.
298251,L645155,u8830,m599,BUD,"Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over."
298252,L645154,u8843,m599,ROGER,"So, does ""this guy"" have a tip for an honest lawyer?"
298253,L645153,u8830,m599,BUD,"""What are you thinking?""...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt."
298254,L645152,u8843,m599,ROGER,What was that?
298255,L645151,u8830,m599,BUD,"Nah, she asked the wrong question."
298256,L645150,u8843,m599,ROGER,Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
298257,L645149,u8830,m599,BUD,Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
298258,L645148,u8843,m599,ROGER,"Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?"
298259,L645532,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?"
298260,L645531,u8830,m599,BUD,Gordon.
298261,L645530,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Hello Bud.
298262,L645518,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Dump it.
298263,L645517,u8830,m599,BUD,"Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide."
298264,L645393,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Are you with me Buddy?
298265,L645392,u8830,m599,BUD,...I can't make it tonight.
298266,L645391,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien..."
298267,L645390,u8830,m599,BUD,Obviously...
298268,L645389,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you..."
298269,L645388,u8830,m599,BUD,How much is enough Gordon?
298270,L645387,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest."
298271,L645386,u8830,m599,BUD,"Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?"
298272,L645385,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life."
298273,L645384,u8830,m599,BUD,"If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word."
298274,L645383,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
298275,L645382,u8830,m599,BUD,Why do you need to wreck this company?
298276,L645381,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place."
298277,L645380,u8830,m599,BUD,Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
298278,L645379,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
298279,L645378,u8830,m599,BUD,I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
298280,L645377,u8836,m599,GEKKO,What the hell do you want?
298281,L645375,u8830,m599,BUD,"I'm sorry, this can't wait."
298282,L645374,u8836,m599,GEKKO,I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
298283,L645319,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain."
298284,L645318,u8830,m599,BUD,"Now, wait a minute, Dad..."
298285,L645292,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox."
298286,L645291,u8830,m599,BUD,"And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt."
298287,L645283,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more..."
298288,L645282,u8830,m599,BUD,"I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts."
298289,L645281,u8836,m599,GEKKO,What makes you think you can?
298290,L645280,u8830,m599,BUD,"The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air..."
298291,L645279,u8836,m599,GEKKO,What does that mean?
298292,L645278,u8830,m599,BUD,"Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside."
298293,L645277,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake."
298294,L645276,u8830,m599,BUD,"Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!"
298295,L645273,u8830,m599,BUD,"Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker..."
298296,L645272,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers..."
298297,L645186,u8830,m599,BUD,I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
298298,L645185,u8836,m599,GEKKO,The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
298299,L645175,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
298300,L645174,u8830,m599,BUD,How much?
298301,L645173,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
298302,L645147,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work."
298303,L645146,u8830,m599,BUD,...Gordon.
298304,L645145,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - ""a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar."" I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on."
298305,L645144,u8830,m599,BUD,"Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%."
298306,L645143,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out."
298307,L645141,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"You're learning, sport..."
298308,L645140,u8830,m599,BUD,"""All warfare is based on deception..."" Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate."
298309,L645139,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs."
298310,L645133,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72."
298311,L645132,u8830,m599,BUD,The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
298312,L645123,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Stick around... Larry, one of my ""gang"" -- Bud Fox."
298313,L645122,u8830,m599,BUD,I guess I'll head back...
298314,L645068,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Allright. Wait here...
298315,L645067,u8830,m599,BUD,"Sorry, Mr. Gekko."
298316,L645063,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up."
298317,L645062,u8830,m599,BUD,"My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow."
298318,L645061,u8836,m599,GEKKO,You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
298319,L645060,u8830,m599,BUD,"...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill."
298320,L645059,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"I'll be right there, fix them a drink."
298321,L645056,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?"
298322,L645055,u8830,m599,BUD,"I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more."
298323,L644990,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being ""comfortable"", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??"
298324,L644989,u8830,m599,BUD,What about hard work?
298325,L644988,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business..."
298326,L644987,u8830,m599,BUD,"Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?"
298327,L644986,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture..."
298328,L644985,u8830,m599,BUD,I don't understand.
298329,L644984,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired..."
298330,L644983,u8830,m599,BUD,I remember that deal. You were involved?
298331,L644982,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
298332,L644981,u8830,m599,BUD,'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
298333,L644980,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Know the name?
298334,L644976,u8830,m599,BUD,Yes...
298335,L644975,u8836,m599,GEKKO,The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
298336,L644974,u8830,m599,BUD,What? How do you know about my father?
298337,L644973,u8836,m599,GEKKO,I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
298338,L644972,u8830,m599,BUD,"Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand."
298339,L644971,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!"
298340,L644970,u8830,m599,BUD,"Nice club, Mr. Gekko..."
298341,L644968,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself..."
298342,L644967,u8830,m599,BUD,"Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on."
298343,L644966,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake..."
298344,L644945,u8830,m599,BUD,Excuse me sir.
298345,L644944,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious."
298346,L644943,u8830,m599,BUD,"Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner."
298347,L644939,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?"
298348,L644938,u8830,m599,BUD,"No sir, that would've been illegal..."
298349,L644937,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
298350,L644936,u8830,m599,BUD,Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
298351,L644935,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today."
298352,L644934,u8830,m599,BUD,...I can't even see it...
298353,L644933,u8836,m599,GEKKO,See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
298354,L644929,u8830,m599,BUD,Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
298355,L644928,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Hi sport.
298356,L644874,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one."
298357,L644873,u8830,m599,BUD,My home number's on the back...
298358,L644868,u8830,m599,BUD,"I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop."
298359,L644867,u8836,m599,GEKKO,How do you know?
298360,L644866,u8830,m599,BUD,There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
298361,L644865,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...don't like airlines, lousy unions..."
298362,L644864,u8830,m599,BUD,"A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities..."
298363,L644863,u8836,m599,GEKKO,...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
298364,L644855,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?"
298365,L644854,u8830,m599,BUD,Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
298366,L644853,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?"
298367,L644852,u8830,m599,BUD,"Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko."
298368,L644851,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?"
298369,L644850,u8830,m599,BUD,"...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff."
298370,L644849,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal."
298371,L644848,u8830,m599,BUD,"Jackson, Steinem..."
298372,L644847,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"So what firm you with, pal?"
298373,L644846,u8830,m599,BUD,"I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you..."
298374,L644845,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor."
298375,L644844,u8830,m599,BUD,"Oh no, no..."
298376,L644843,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me."
298377,L644841,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?"
298378,L644840,u8830,m599,BUD,How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
298379,L645556,u8834,m599,DARIEN,I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
298380,L645555,u8830,m599,BUD,Why?
298381,L645554,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Hi.
298382,L645417,u8830,m599,BUD,Get the hell out!
298383,L645416,u8834,m599,DARIEN,You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
298384,L645413,u8830,m599,BUD,I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
298385,L645412,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before..."
298386,L645411,u8830,m599,BUD,"You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien..."
298387,L645409,u8830,m599,BUD,What the hell's that supposed to mean?
298388,L645408,u8834,m599,DARIEN,I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
298389,L645407,u8830,m599,BUD,I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
298390,L645406,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!"
298391,L645405,u8830,m599,BUD,At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
298392,L645404,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
298393,L645403,u8830,m599,BUD,I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
298394,L645402,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision."
298395,L645401,u8830,m599,BUD,Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
298396,L645400,u8834,m599,DARIEN,I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
298397,L645270,u8830,m599,BUD,"Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride."
298398,L645269,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?"
298399,L645268,u8830,m599,BUD,"...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded..."
298400,L645267,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler..."
298401,L645266,u8830,m599,BUD,"Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side."
298402,L645265,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much."
298403,L645264,u8830,m599,BUD,"I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?"
298404,L645263,u8830,m599,BUD,"You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker."
298405,L645262,u8834,m599,DARIEN,...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
298406,L645261,u8830,m599,BUD,"Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching..."
298407,L645246,u8834,m599,DARIEN,I'll let you know.
298408,L645245,u8830,m599,BUD,"It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far."
298409,L645244,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Do you think you're ready?
298410,L645243,u8830,m599,BUD,"That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside..."
298411,L645242,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection."
298412,L645241,u8830,m599,BUD,"I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise."
298413,L645240,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone..."
298414,L645239,u8830,m599,BUD,"Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable."
298415,L645238,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the ""demolished"" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio."
298416,L645237,u8830,m599,BUD,"You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn."
298417,L645236,u8830,m599,BUD,...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.
298418,L645235,u8834,m599,DARIEN,...isn't it perfect!
298419,L645207,u8830,m599,BUD,You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
298420,L645206,u8834,m599,DARIEN,I don't.
298421,L645205,u8830,m599,BUD,"Well, why stop at that?"
298422,L645204,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything..."
298423,L645203,u8830,m599,BUD,And what do you want?
298424,L645202,u8834,m599,DARIEN,You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
298425,L645201,u8830,m599,BUD,"The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us."
298426,L645200,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"So, how did your conference go with Gordon?"
298427,L645199,u8830,m599,BUD,"Yeah, almost..."
298428,L645198,u8834,m599,DARIEN,If I could have anything... this would almost do.
298429,L645178,u8830,m599,BUD,How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
298430,L645177,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper."
298431,L645176,u8830,m599,BUD,Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
298432,L645111,u8830,m599,BUD,Only if I want something bad enough.
298433,L645110,u8834,m599,DARIEN,You really do believe in destiny?
298434,L645109,u8830,m599,BUD,So. See you Friday.
298435,L645108,u8830,m599,BUD,You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
298436,L645107,u8834,m599,DARIEN,I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
298437,L645106,u8830,m599,BUD,Break it.
298438,L645105,u8834,m599,DARIEN,What if I have a previous engagement?
298439,L645104,u8830,m599,BUD,Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
298440,L645103,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
298441,L645102,u8830,m599,BUD,Upper West Side.
298442,L645101,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Where is it?
298443,L645100,u8830,m599,BUD,"Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place."
298444,L645099,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"You got it, a great spender of other people's money."
298445,L645098,u8830,m599,BUD,I gather you're a decorator.
298446,L645097,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray."
298447,L645096,u8830,m599,BUD,"Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here."
298448,L645095,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration."
298449,L645094,u8830,m599,BUD,You could have a great beach house for that.
298450,L645093,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June."
298451,L645092,u8830,m599,BUD,...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
298452,L645091,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week."
298453,L645090,u8830,m599,BUD,Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
298454,L645089,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Aha. Poet or philosopher?
298455,L645088,u8830,m599,BUD,"Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together."
298456,L645087,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Oh yes, I remember you."
298457,L645086,u8830,m599,BUD,Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
298458,L645085,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Excuse me.
298459,L645084,u8830,m599,BUD,"Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks."
298460,L645425,u8830,m599,BUD,Oh Christ!
298461,L645424,u8832,m599,CAROLYN,"He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital..."
298462,L645421,u8830,m599,BUD,"...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent..."
298463,L645420,u8832,m599,CAROLYN,Bud! Where you been the last two days?
298464,L644963,u8830,m599,BUD,...how do you know? You wish...
298465,L644962,u8832,m599,CAROLYN,You were never that innocent sugarpie.
298466,L644961,u8830,m599,BUD,Any better and I'd be guilty.
298467,L644960,u8832,m599,CAROLYN,"Morning Buddy, you look happy."
298468,L644738,u8830,m599,BUD,"Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin..."
298469,L644737,u8832,m599,CAROLYN,How you doing Buddy?
298470,L645221,u8830,m599,BUD,"...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim."
298471,L645220,u8839,m599,MANNHEIM,You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
298472,L645031,u8830,m599,BUD,"It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy."
298473,L645030,u8839,m599,MANNHEIM,"Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud."
298474,L645029,u8830,m599,BUD,"You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things."
298475,L645028,u8839,m599,MANNHEIM,"No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out."
298476,L645027,u8830,m599,BUD,"Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel."
298477,L644918,u8830,m599,BUD,Old values. Buy.
298478,L644917,u8839,m599,MANNHEIM,"Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it."
298479,L644916,u8830,m599,BUD,Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
298480,L644752,u8839,m599,MANNHEIM,"Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it."
298481,L644751,u8830,m599,BUD,"You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry..."
298482,L645322,u8831,m599,CARL,"...that ""scum"" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day..."
298483,L645321,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground."
298484,L645317,u8831,m599,CARL,"No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ..."
298485,L645316,u8836,m599,GEKKO,I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
298486,L645315,u8831,m599,CARL,There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
298487,L645314,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen."
298488,L645295,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?"
298489,L645294,u8831,m599,CARL,I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
298490,L645456,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of."
298491,L645455,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill."
298492,L645454,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows."
298493,L645453,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
298494,L645452,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit."
298495,L645451,u8834,m599,DARIEN,I can't...and I won't.
298496,L645450,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
298497,L645449,u8834,m599,DARIEN,Because I don't want to see him hurt.
298498,L645448,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Now tell me, why would I want to do that?"
298499,L645447,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal."
298500,L645446,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?..."
298501,L645445,u8836,m599,GEKKO,You told him about us?
298502,L645444,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"It's over you, Gordon."
298503,L645443,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
298504,L645442,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up."
298505,L645441,u8836,m599,GEKKO,So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
298506,L645440,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
298507,L645439,u8834,m599,DARIEN,"Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago."
298508,L645438,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine."
298509,L644872,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
298510,L644871,u8842,m599,OLLIE,"And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada."
298511,L644870,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie."
298512,L644869,u8842,m599,OLLIE,"... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag."
298513,L644858,u8842,m599,OLLIE,"He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake."
298514,L644857,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red."
298515,L644835,u8842,m599,OLLIE,"You got it, G.G."
298516,L644834,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!"
298517,L645138,u8844,m599,WILDMAN,Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
298518,L645137,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50."
298519,L645130,u8844,m599,WILDMAN,"I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment."
298520,L645129,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the ""sir"" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline..."
298521,L645128,u8844,m599,WILDMAN,"No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers..."
298522,L645127,u8836,m599,GEKKO,The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
298523,L645126,u8844,m599,WILDMAN,Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
298524,L645125,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured."
298525,L645506,u8845,m599,WILMORE,"We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko."
298526,L645505,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!"
298527,L645498,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it."
298528,L645497,u8845,m599,WILMORE,"We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar."
298529,L645311,u8845,m599,WILMORE,"If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people."
298530,L645310,u8836,m599,GEKKO,Cards are on the table. What do you think?
298531,L645306,u8836,m599,GEKKO,I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
298532,L645305,u8845,m599,WILMORE,Are you prepared to put that in writing?
298533,L645301,u8836,m599,GEKKO,"Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut."
298534,L645300,u8845,m599,WILMORE,"With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?"
298535,L646115,u8846,m600,CHINA,A body.  I mean we're talking major body
298536,L646114,u8855,m600,SARAH,What's that?
298537,L646113,u8846,m600,CHINA,But he still has something Mark hasn't.
298538,L646112,u8855,m600,SARAH,But?
298539,L646111,u8855,m600,SARAH,So why are you dating Jonathan?
298540,L646110,u8846,m600,CHINA,Yeah
298541,L646109,u8855,m600,SARAH,"Yeah, yeah, OK"
298542,L646108,u8855,m600,SARAH,"Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care."
298543,L646107,u8846,m600,CHINA,Businessman!
298544,L646106,u8855,m600,SARAH,Businessman?
298545,L646105,u8846,m600,CHINA,"Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady."
298546,L646104,u8855,m600,SARAH,He did?
298547,L646103,u8846,m600,CHINA,Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
298548,L646102,u8855,m600,SARAH,He still likes you
298549,L646101,u8846,m600,CHINA,With Mark?
298550,L646100,u8855,m600,SARAH,I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
298551,L646421,u8851,m600,MARK,China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
298552,L646420,u8846,m600,CHINA,Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
298553,L646180,u8851,m600,MARK,"Ok toots, I will."
298554,L646179,u8846,m600,CHINA,"Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?"
298555,L646173,u8851,m600,MARK,Suffer?  We're living in America.
298556,L646172,u8846,m600,CHINA,Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
298557,L646171,u8851,m600,MARK,I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
298558,L646170,u8851,m600,MARK,A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
298559,L646169,u8851,m600,MARK,"Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'."
298560,L646168,u8846,m600,CHINA,Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
298561,L646167,u8851,m600,MARK,About what?  About us.
298562,L646166,u8851,m600,MARK,We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
298563,L646162,u8846,m600,CHINA,It's eleven forty-five let's go
298564,L646161,u8851,m600,MARK,Anybody want another drink?
298565,L646144,u8851,m600,MARK,Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
298566,L646143,u8846,m600,CHINA,Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
298567,L646322,u8853,m600,MR LINCOLN,Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
298568,L646321,u8847,m600,INSPECTOR ROBERTS,"Yes, I guess you're right"
298569,L646320,u8847,m600,INSPECTOR ROBERTS,It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
298570,L646319,u8853,m600,MR LINCOLN,Would you like a closer look?
298571,L646318,u8847,m600,INSPECTOR ROBERTS,Hmm.
298572,L646317,u8853,m600,MR LINCOLN,"Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too."
298573,L646309,u8853,m600,MR LINCOLN,Hi
298574,L646308,u8847,m600,INSPECTOR ROBERTS,Weird and tiny huh?

298592,L646269,u8849,m600,JONATHAN,A party at a waxwork huh?
298593,L646268,u8854,m600,MRS WEBSTER,She went to a waxwork party
298594,L646267,u8849,m600,JONATHAN,No?

298602,L646256,u8851,m600,MARK,"Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable."
298603,L646255,u8850,m600,JUNIOR,I hope you enjoyed your visit.
298604,L646193,u8851,m600,MARK,"Uh, wrong picture Tony."
298605,L646192,u8850,m600,JUNIOR,Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
298606,L646401,u8855,m600,SARAH,Go away.
298607,L646400,u8851,m600,MARK,Sarah listen to me.
298608,L646365,u8851,m600,MARK,China
298609,L646364,u8855,m600,SARAH,"Well, it all started when a friend and I"
298610,L646343,u8851,m600,MARK,"Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork."
298611,L646342,u8855,m600,SARAH,Well?
298612,L646340,u8855,m600,SARAH,Who's is all this?
298613,L646339,u8851,m600,MARK,If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
298614,L646334,u8855,m600,SARAH,Big deal!
298615,L646333,u8851,m600,MARK,You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
298616,L646332,u8855,m600,SARAH,Oh that explains everything.
298617,L646331,u8851,m600,MARK,"Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man."
298618,L646330,u8855,m600,SARAH,You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
298619,L646300,u8855,m600,SARAH,A little?
298620,L646299,u8851,m600,MARK,"Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional."
298621,L646298,u8855,m600,SARAH,That's not what you said last night.
298622,L646297,u8851,m600,MARK,"No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends."
298623,L646286,u8855,m600,SARAH,No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
298624,L646285,u8851,m600,MARK,Come on.
298625,L646284,u8855,m600,SARAH,I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
298626,L646283,u8855,m600,SARAH,No Mark. MARK Why not?
298627,L646263,u8855,m600,SARAH,I know what you mean.
298628,L646262,u8851,m600,MARK,Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
298629,L646261,u8855,m600,SARAH,Then why do you still like her?
298630,L646254,u8851,m600,MARK,"I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok."
298631,L646253,u8855,m600,SARAH,Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
298632,L646252,u8851,m600,MARK,"What?  Tony and China, together?"
298633,L646251,u8855,m600,SARAH,"Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home."
298634,L646247,u8855,m600,SARAH,I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
298635,L646246,u8851,m600,MARK,Haven't we been doing our homework.
298636,L646204,u8857,m600,TONY,This. is killer.
298637,L646203,u8851,m600,MARK,"Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display."
298638,L646202,u8857,m600,TONY,This time I really don't see anyone man.
298639,L646190,u8857,m600,TONY,Right behind you.
298640,L646189,u8851,m600,MARK,Anyone else not coming?
298641,L646183,u8851,m600,MARK,Right.
298642,L646182,u8857,m600,TONY,Safety in numbers man.
298643,L646181,u8851,m600,MARK,"Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room."
298644,L646138,u8857,m600,TONY,"Forget her Mark, she's a bitch"
298645,L646137,u8851,m600,MARK,I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
298646,L646376,u8856,m600,SIR WILFRED,"Maybe before the event, never after."
298647,L646375,u8851,m600,MARK,Can this be stopped?
298648,L646374,u8851,m600,MARK,"Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!"
298649,L646373,u8856,m600,SIR WILFRED,"You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple."
298650,L646372,u8856,m600,SIR WILFRED,Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
298651,L646371,u8851,m600,MARK,Sell my soul?
298652,L646370,u8856,m600,SIR WILFRED,"If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either"
298653,L646368,u8851,m600,MARK,Six six and six

I've had some kind of ""empty-nest"" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist."
298713,L648458,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,That can't feel good.

298715,L648456,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,What?
298716,L648452,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman."
298717,L648451,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,You were in an accident?
298718,L648450,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but..."
298719,L648449,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Have you been hurt?
298720,L648448,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
298721,L648447,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,What do you think?  Guess.
298722,L648446,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No.
298723,L648445,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Do you?
298724,L648444,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"She said, ""You know.""  That I know."
298725,L648442,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I don't know, I'm very confused right now."
298726,L648441,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,You're saying you willed these events to happen?
298727,L648440,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became."
298728,L648439,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,You think you influenced her?
298729,L648438,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Isn't there something called group hysteria?
298730,L648437,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Your friend saw them.
298731,L648436,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Yes, but..."
298732,L648435,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,"Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern."
298733,L648434,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,"Well, that's what we're here for."
298734,L648433,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What's happening to me?
298735,L648361,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
298736,L648360,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,How?
298737,L648359,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Nope.
298738,L648358,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Are you humoring me?
298739,L648357,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
298740,L648356,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You think that'll help?
298741,L648355,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Try to communicate with her somehow.
298742,L648354,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What?
298743,L648352,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What do you think I should do?
298744,L648351,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Fine.
298745,L648350,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
298746,L648349,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Do you have any idea who she is?
298747,L648348,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Pretty.  She's a blond.
298748,L648347,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,What does she look like?
298749,L648346,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
298750,L648345,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,How do you know it's a she?
298751,L648344,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
298752,L648342,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Mm-hmm.
298753,L648341,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,These are good.
298754,L648336,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You're joking.
298755,L648335,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Fireball?
298756,L648334,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?"
298757,L648333,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Why is he worried?
298758,L648332,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No.
298759,L648331,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Do you really think so?
298760,L648330,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
298761,L648329,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Your husband?
298762,L648328,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Because he was worried about me.
298763,L648327,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Then why did you?
298764,L648326,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I didn't want to come.
298765,L648325,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
298766,L648324,u8860,m601,DR. DRAYTON,Who's idea was it?
298767,L648582,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,The wives.
298768,L648581,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Who's that?
298769,L648580,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,"Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know."
298770,L648579,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine."
298771,L648578,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,Toward the end.  You remember?
298772,L648577,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,At the party.
298773,L648576,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
298774,L648575,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
298775,L648574,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
298776,L648573,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,"Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year."
298777,L648572,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Uh-huh.  What can be?
298778,L648571,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,I know how hard it can be sometimes.
298779,L648570,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'm sorry?
298780,L648569,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
298781,L648568,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Almost.
298782,L648567,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
298783,L648566,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
298784,L648565,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,How're you holding up?
298785,L648538,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
298786,L648537,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I am.
298787,L648536,u8866,m601,MRS. TEMPLETON,Of course.  You must be so proud.
298788,L648428,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,I didn't kill my wife.
298789,L648427,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Give me that shit.  Your wife.
298790,L648426,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,Who?
298791,L648194,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,I have to go.
298792,L648193,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Oh-kay...
298793,L648192,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,I don't know.
298794,L648191,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,When...when will she be back?
298795,L648190,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,She isn't here.
298796,L648189,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Well maybe your wife...
298797,L648188,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,This really isn't a good time.
298798,L648187,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door."
298799,L648186,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
298800,L648185,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Um...
298801,L648184,u8863,m601,MR. FEUR,Yes?
298802,L648484,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
298803,L648483,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"No.  No, I don't."
298804,L648482,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,You must think I'm pathetic.
298805,L648481,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,"I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home."
298806,L648480,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Um...sure.
298807,L648479,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
298808,L648478,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What?
298809,L648477,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,Love.
298810,L648475,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
298811,L648474,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
298812,L648473,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,No.
298813,L648470,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
298814,L648469,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Thank you.
298815,L648468,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,Your house is so beautiful.
298816,L648467,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,Very much.
298817,L648466,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Would you like some iced tea?
298818,L648465,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,Right.  I'm sorry.
298819,L648464,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,And then you weren't there.
298820,L648463,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
298821,L648462,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You do?
298822,L648461,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,I wanted to apologize.
298823,L648043,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Wait!  Don't go...
298824,L648042,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
298825,L648041,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
298826,L648040,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,This fence...it's so...
298827,L648039,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
298828,L648038,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,I've never even met you.
298829,L648037,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,That's not...It's not like that.
298830,L648036,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
298831,L648035,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Tell me.  I can help you.
298832,L648034,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
298833,L648033,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Tell me.  Please.
298834,L648032,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,"I can't, no, no, I can't..."
298835,L648031,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What?  What are you afraid of?
298836,L648030,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,"And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of..."
298837,L648029,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Who?  Your husband?
298838,L648028,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
298839,L648027,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,I'm not...
298840,L648026,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Hello?
298841,L648025,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Is everything alright?
298842,L648024,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,I've seen you.  From the window.
298843,L648023,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Um...yes.
298844,L648022,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,You're the flower lady.
298845,L648021,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
298846,L648020,u8864,m601,MRS. FEUR,Who are you?
298847,L648659,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
298848,L648658,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What was her major?
298849,L648657,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Of course.
298850,L648656,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
298851,L648655,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I should be going anyway.
298852,L648654,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,They're calling me in to work.
298853,L648651,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You must have been very proud.
298854,L648650,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
298855,L648648,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
298856,L648647,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I don't know.
298857,L648646,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Why are you here?
298858,L648644,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
298859,L648643,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She never mentioned her father.
298860,L648642,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
298861,L648641,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
298862,L648640,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,You look a little old for a student.
298863,L648639,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's fine.
298864,L648638,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
298865,L648635,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,She never mentioned you.
298866,L648634,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Claire.
298867,L648633,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,What's your name?
298868,L648630,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Please leave me alone.
298869,L648629,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"No, I don't."
298870,L648628,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,You know where she is?
298871,L648627,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
298872,L648626,u8865,m601,MRS. FRANK,Yeah.
298873,L648625,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Mrs. Frank?
298874,L648305,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
298875,L648304,u8861,m601,ELENA,She got it.  Turned it down.
298876,L648302,u8861,m601,ELENA,I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
298877,L648301,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She's making this up.
298878,L648300,u8861,m601,ELENA,And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
298879,L648299,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Do we have to?
298880,L648298,u8861,m601,ELENA,We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
298881,L648297,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Stop.
298882,L648296,u8861,m601,ELENA,You should have heard her play.
298883,L648293,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Oh God...
298884,L648292,u8861,m601,ELENA,And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
298885,L648291,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,We were suite mates.
298886,L648290,u8861,m601,ELENA,I came in from my room...
298887,L648289,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,He was so pissed.
298888,L648288,u8861,m601,ELENA,...just so she could cut them off.
298889,L648287,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I didn't sleep with him.
298890,L648286,u8861,m601,ELENA,"Anyway, Claire slept with him..."
298891,L648285,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,He looked like one of the Monkees.
298892,L648282,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,We know each other.
298893,L648281,u8861,m601,ELENA,This is...
298894,L648280,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Wow.
298895,L648805,u8862,m601,JODY,"Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go."
298896,L648804,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I don't know...
298897,L648803,u8862,m601,JODY,"You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters."
298898,L648802,u8862,m601,JODY,"He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too."
298899,L648801,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I guess not.
298900,L648800,u8862,m601,JODY,What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
298901,L648799,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Jody he was lying.
298902,L648798,u8862,m601,JODY,Did he say that?
298903,L648797,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
298904,L648770,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What is it?
298905,L648769,u8862,m601,JODY,"I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up..."
298906,L648768,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Like what?
298907,L648767,u8862,m601,JODY,"Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it."
298908,L648766,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
298909,L648765,u8862,m601,JODY,We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
298910,L648764,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I can't believe this is happening.
298911,L648763,u8862,m601,JODY,I know.
298912,L648762,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Jody, she tried to kill him."
298913,L648750,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
298914,L648749,u8862,m601,JODY,"You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection."
298915,L648748,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
298916,L648747,u8862,m601,JODY,If she was dangerous before--
298917,L648746,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I don't know.
298918,L648745,u8862,m601,JODY,What are you going to do?
298919,L648744,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
298920,L648743,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No.
298921,L648742,u8862,m601,JODY,I'm a terrible friend.
298922,L648741,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,All of us.
298923,L648740,u8862,m601,JODY,I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
298924,L648739,u8862,m601,JODY,Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
298925,L648738,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Too late?  Jody, it was an accident."
298926,L648737,u8862,m601,JODY,"By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late."
298927,L648736,u8862,m601,JODY,"I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed."
298928,L648735,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Relieved?
298929,L648734,u8862,m601,JODY,Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
298930,L648733,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Why?
298931,L648732,u8862,m601,JODY,I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
298932,L648731,u8862,m601,JODY,Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
298933,L648730,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Adamant?
298934,L648729,u8862,m601,JODY,I was down in Adamant...
298935,L648728,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Oh God...you knew.
298936,L648564,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
298937,L648563,u8862,m601,JODY,Okay.  Okay.
298938,L648562,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Please.
298939,L648561,u8862,m601,JODY,But Claire--
298940,L648560,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now."
298941,L648559,u8862,m601,JODY,"And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours."
298942,L648558,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Hartford?
298943,L648557,u8862,m601,JODY,"Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford..."
298944,L648556,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Did I?
298945,L648555,u8862,m601,JODY,Something was there.  You saw it.
298946,L648554,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--"
298947,L648553,u8862,m601,JODY,Then what was it?
298948,L648552,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
298949,L648551,u8862,m601,JODY,What?
298950,L648550,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Jody, she's alive."
298951,L648549,u8862,m601,JODY,Does Norman know?
298952,L648548,u8862,m601,JODY,"I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen."
298953,L648547,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's alright.
298954,L648546,u8862,m601,JODY,"I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire..."
298955,L648545,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I think so
298956,L648544,u8862,m601,JODY,Are you okay?
298957,L648389,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Jody, wait."
298958,L648388,u8862,m601,JODY,I have to go.
298959,L648383,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
298960,L648382,u8862,m601,JODY,Mef?  What's Mef?
298961,L648381,u8862,m601,JODY,M-E...
298962,L648380,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Oh...
298963,L648375,u8862,m601,JODY,Shhh.
298964,L648374,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Nothing's happening.
298965,L648371,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I don't know.
298966,L648370,u8862,m601,JODY,We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
298967,L648369,u8862,m601,JODY,This.
298968,L648368,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,The planchette?
298969,L648367,u8862,m601,JODY,Place your fingers on the planchette.
298970,L648364,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
298971,L648363,u8862,m601,JODY,Sit down here.
298972,L648218,u8862,m601,JODY,"No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly."
298973,L648217,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Wow.  I'm losing it.
298974,L648215,u8862,m601,JODY,I don't...
298975,L648214,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,In the window.  Norman's at work.
298976,L648213,u8862,m601,JODY,What?
298977,L648212,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Someone's there.
298978,L648209,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Please.  That's all I need.
298979,L648208,u8862,m601,JODY,Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
298980,L648207,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,...no...no...no...
298981,L648206,u8862,m601,JODY,Telling you...
298982,L648205,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Jody, no..."
298983,L648204,u8862,m601,JODY,Seance.
298984,L648203,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What?
298985,L648202,u8862,m601,JODY,Know what I think?
298986,L648199,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?"
298987,L648198,u8862,m601,JODY,You think he killed her?
298988,L648101,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You got it.
298989,L648100,u8862,m601,JODY,"Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?"
298990,L648099,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Absolutely.
298991,L648098,u8862,m601,JODY,"Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?"
298992,L648097,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's niiice.
298993,L648096,u8862,m601,JODY,Yep.
298994,L648095,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Oh my god.  You bought it.
298995,L648094,u8862,m601,JODY,So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
298996,L648093,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Thanks, but I'm fine."
298997,L648092,u8862,m601,JODY,She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
298998,L648091,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You're discussing me with your psychic?
298999,L648090,u8862,m601,JODY,It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
299000,L648089,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Jody--
299001,L648088,u8862,m601,JODY,Kambucha mushroom tea...
299002,L648087,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What is it?
299003,L648086,u8862,m601,JODY,Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
299004,L648085,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
299005,L648084,u8862,m601,JODY,Well good.  So you're human.
299006,L648083,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Okay, I'm a little tender."
299007,L648082,u8862,m601,JODY,Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
299008,L648081,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Why does everyone find that so surprising?
299009,L648080,u8862,m601,JODY,You are?
299010,L648079,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Good.  I'm good.
299011,L648078,u8862,m601,JODY,How you holding up?
299012,L648842,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,MADISON!
299013,L648841,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What?
299014,L648840,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Mauduh...
299015,L648839,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Shhhh.
299016,L648838,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Mmmuh...
299017,L648821,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!"
299018,L648820,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I don't believe you.
299019,L648819,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--"
299020,L648818,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!"
299021,L648817,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
299022,L648816,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
299023,L648811,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
299024,L648810,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I know.
299025,L648809,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You don't have to do that.
299026,L648808,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I'm cooking you dinner.
299027,L648807,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Nothing.
299028,L648806,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What's that for?
299029,L648795,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
299030,L648794,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Don't think so.
299031,L648793,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Do you know it?
299032,L648792,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Huh.
299033,L648791,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
299034,L648790,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What?
299035,L648789,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Adamant.
299036,L648788,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
299037,L648787,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Look for antiques...
299038,L648786,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
299039,L648785,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,The leaves...
299040,L648781,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Claire...
299041,L648780,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it."
299042,L648779,u8867,m601,NORMAN,How can you be sure?
299043,L648778,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She can't be here without me.
299044,L648777,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What?
299045,L648776,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She's gone.
299046,L648775,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Can't you see, she's trying to kill us."
299047,L648774,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's alright.
299048,L648773,u8867,m601,NORMAN,We have to get out of here.
299049,L648723,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?"
299050,L648722,u8867,m601,NORMAN,We don't know that for sure.
299051,L648721,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She did it.
299052,L648718,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,How did she know where it was?
299053,L648717,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house..."
299054,L648711,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Get out of my way.
299055,L648710,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Claire...
299056,L648709,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You should have tried harder.
299057,L648708,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I tried to break it off!
299058,L648707,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'm not going to listen to this.
299059,L648706,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped."
299060,L648705,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Stop...
299061,L648704,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive..."
299062,L648703,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Leave her out of this!
299063,L648702,u8867,m601,NORMAN,To Caitlin!!
299064,L648701,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Who?
299065,L648700,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her."
299066,L648699,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family..."
299067,L648698,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I never asked you to quit!
299068,L648697,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
299069,L648696,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Claire, please don't..."
299070,L648693,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
299071,L648692,u8867,m601,NORMAN,That's not what I'm sayi--
299072,L648691,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,So you fucked a student?!
299073,L648690,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It was last year.  We were having troubles.
299074,L648689,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now."
299075,L648688,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Oh God...
299076,L648687,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
299077,L648686,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Claire--
299078,L648685,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I was there.
299079,L648684,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What?
299080,L648683,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"""You know..."""
299081,L648681,u8867,m601,NORMAN,STOP IT!
299082,L648680,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Your wife...
299083,L648679,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Who?
299084,L648678,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I think she's starting to suspect something.
299085,L648677,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor."
299086,L648676,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"I don't like this, this..."
299087,L648675,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Since when?
299088,L648674,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's too rough.
299089,L648673,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What's the matter?
299090,L648672,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Ow!
299091,L648669,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Wouldn't go that far.
299092,L648668,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I take it your not mad at me.
299093,L648619,u8867,m601,NORMAN,STOP IT!
299094,L648618,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's Madison Fra--
299095,L648617,u8867,m601,NORMAN,...Please stop...
299096,L648616,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,...I'm positive this time...
299097,L648615,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Stop...
299098,L648614,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not..."
299099,L648613,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Yes.  The ghost.
299100,L648612,u8867,m601,NORMAN,The...
299101,L648611,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
299102,L648610,u8867,m601,NORMAN,No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
299103,L648609,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Not personally.
299104,L648608,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I may have seen her on campus.
299105,L648596,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What's wrong with me?
299106,L648595,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Sweetheart, it was over a year ago."
299107,L648594,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,But I don't remember.
299108,L648593,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
299109,L648592,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
299110,L648591,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
299111,L648590,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,In the living room...
299112,L648589,u8867,m601,NORMAN,A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
299113,L648588,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I...
299114,L648587,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You dropped a glass.
299115,L648586,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"When she said it, there was something familiar...but no."
299116,L648585,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You don't remember?
299117,L648500,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You told me that I was...
299118,L648499,u8867,m601,NORMAN,We walked all night...
299119,L648498,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I felt you...looking through me...
299120,L648497,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
299121,L648496,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
299122,L648495,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You know I am.
299123,L648494,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Are you glad?  I'm glad.
299124,L648493,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What?
299125,L648491,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Call ya later.
299126,L648490,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Yep.
299127,L648489,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Do I have everything?
299128,L648488,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Really big bed.
299129,L648487,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"No, it's fine.  I'm fine."
299130,L648486,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?"
299131,L648430,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Then where is she?
299132,L648429,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I'm sorry...
299133,L648420,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Claire, please..."
299134,L648419,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
299135,L648418,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I will NOT.
299136,L648417,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Keep your voice down.
299137,L648414,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you."
299138,L648413,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Sweetheart--
299139,L648412,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not..."
299140,L648411,u8867,m601,NORMAN,But then you've been so much better...
299141,L648410,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,The accident...?
299142,L648409,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or..."
299143,L648408,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Sabotage?
299144,L648407,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow."
299145,L648406,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What are you...?  No.
299146,L648405,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
299147,L648404,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What?
299148,L648402,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
299149,L648401,u8867,m601,NORMAN,How did you--
299150,L648400,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave."
299151,L648399,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Who did?
299152,L648398,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,We had a seance.
299153,L648397,u8867,m601,NORMAN,How do you know this?
299154,L648396,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
299155,L648395,u8867,m601,NORMAN,This is the Feur thing?
299156,L648394,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
299157,L648393,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What are you doing out here?
299158,L648323,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
299159,L648322,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Are you lonely?
299160,L648321,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up."
299161,L648320,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I never said...
299162,L648319,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some ""symptom"" of something..."
299163,L648318,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong."
299164,L648315,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What can it hurt to talk to someone?
299165,L648314,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Norman...
299166,L648313,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Harvey says he's amazing.
299167,L648312,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I don't need a shrink.
299168,L648272,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Well, that's a relief."
299169,L648271,u8867,m601,NORMAN,There we go.
299170,L648270,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,We're going to be fine.
299171,L648269,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
299172,L648268,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You're not at the center.
299173,L648267,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Five minutes?
299174,L648266,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
299175,L648265,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What are you doing?
299176,L648264,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just..."
299177,L648263,u8867,m601,NORMAN,...like it never even happened...
299178,L648262,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,...Don't get all...
299179,L648261,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"When you do this, I swear..."
299180,L648259,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--"
299181,L648258,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Tonight?
299182,L648257,u8867,m601,NORMAN,...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
299183,L648256,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Oh.
299184,L648255,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since..."
299185,L648254,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,When?
299186,L648253,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
299187,L648252,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Dressed?
299188,L648251,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?"
299189,L648250,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--"
299190,L648249,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?"
299191,L648248,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Maybe.  Point is...not me.
299192,L648247,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
299193,L648246,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I didn't do that.
299194,L648245,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What am I looking at?
299195,L648244,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,See?
299196,L648243,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
299197,L648242,u8867,m601,NORMAN,She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
299198,L648241,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Where is she then?
299199,L648236,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's a ghost.
299200,L648235,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
299201,L648234,u8867,m601,NORMAN,From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
299202,L648233,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,A flare?
299203,L648232,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's a flare.
299204,L648231,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No.  Look!  In the window.
299205,L648230,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Our house.
299206,L648229,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this."
299207,L648228,u8867,m601,NORMAN,And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
299208,L648227,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
299209,L648226,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What?
299210,L648225,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,He killed her.
299211,L648223,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Shhhh.
299212,L648222,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"What's going on, Claire?"
299213,L648221,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Get down!  He'll see.
299214,L648178,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Huh.
299215,L648177,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly."
299216,L648176,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Did you call about the Feurs?
299217,L648175,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Sorry.  You understand.
299218,L648172,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't."
299219,L648171,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You didn't?
299220,L648170,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What?  No.  No.
299221,L648169,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Did you tell her?
299222,L648168,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
299223,L648167,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe."
299224,L648166,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'm so sorry.
299225,L648165,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"""...for my father."""
299226,L648164,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,That's...
299227,L648163,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"""...of Perpetual Distances.""  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  ""I'm afraid you've mistaken me,""  I say..."
299228,L648162,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Oh, no..."
299229,L648161,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"""...especially Spencer's Theorem..."""
299230,L648160,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Well, that's nice."
299231,L648159,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, ""Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."""
299232,L648158,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Wow.
299233,L648157,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us..."
299234,L648156,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You're kidding.
299235,L648155,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
299236,L648154,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You know what that does to me.
299237,L648153,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer..."
299238,L648152,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Yep.
299239,L648151,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,You are so brilliant.
299240,L648150,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I think so.  Maybe.
299241,L648149,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Really?
299242,L648148,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Think I may have cracked it.
299243,L648147,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?"
299244,L648146,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
299245,L648141,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I don't know.  Just...whispering.
299246,L648140,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What kind of whispering?
299247,L648139,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
299248,L648138,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Of course.
299249,L648137,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
299250,L648136,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Did you call the police?
299251,L648135,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,In the house.  I was scared.
299252,L648134,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What do you mean?  Some noises where?
299253,L648133,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
299254,L648132,u8867,m601,NORMAN,What are you doing here?
299255,L648113,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
299256,L648112,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Claire?
299257,L648110,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"No, no.  It's fine."
299258,L648109,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Unless you need me to come home...
299259,L648108,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Oh.
299260,L648107,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
299261,L648106,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Hi.
299262,L648075,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Is it gone?
299263,L648074,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
299264,L648071,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Hurry...
299265,L648070,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Mmnph.
299266,L648069,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Norman, you have to look at this!"
299267,L648066,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Promise?
299268,L648065,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out."
299269,L648064,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I just wish you could have heard her.
299270,L648063,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's what I've been working for.
299271,L648062,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I know.
299272,L648061,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is..."
299273,L648060,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'd never be able to live with mysel--
299274,L648059,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Claire...
299275,L648058,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,But what if something happens?
299276,L648057,u8867,m601,NORMAN,...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
299277,L648056,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,That's not what I'm sug--
299278,L648055,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--"
299279,L648054,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,To make sure she's all right.
299280,L648053,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Why?
299281,L648052,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--"
299282,L648051,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Remember how we were?
299283,L648050,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
299284,L648049,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds."
299285,L648048,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,More or less.
299286,L648047,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Did she say that?
299287,L648046,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Of him I think.
299288,L648045,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Of what?
299289,L648014,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I'll be there.
299290,L648013,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,After that.
299291,L648012,u8867,m601,NORMAN,I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
299292,L648011,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Tomorrow.
299293,L648010,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Maybe we should just...
299294,L648009,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Mmm.
299295,L648008,u8867,m601,NORMAN,And we moved out here for the quiet.
299296,L648004,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Shhh.
299297,L648003,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Did you...
299298,L648002,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Yup.
299299,L648001,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Wanna fool around?
299300,L648000,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Nope.
299301,L647999,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Tired?
299302,L647998,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I know.
299303,L647997,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's just us now.
299304,L647996,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,We did.
299305,L647995,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
299306,L647994,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
299307,L647993,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You are...
299308,L647992,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
299309,L647991,u8867,m601,NORMAN,You know what I mean.
299310,L647990,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Not the focus.
299311,L647989,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's just she's been the focus for a while.
299312,L647988,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,"I am, really."
299313,L647987,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's okay if you're not.
299314,L647986,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Fine.
299315,L647985,u8867,m601,NORMAN,How are you?
299316,L647984,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"No, no.  I'm just about...  There."
299317,L647983,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,If you have to work...
299318,L647982,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Nice.  Almost done.
299319,L647981,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
299320,L647980,u8867,m601,NORMAN,How is it?
299321,L647979,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
299322,L647978,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Whatcha reading?
299323,L647957,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Three o'clock.
299324,L647956,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Claire?
299325,L647954,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Yep.
299326,L647953,u8867,m601,NORMAN,It's today?
299327,L647951,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,It's Saturday.
299328,L647950,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Claire, I have to show up for the--"
299329,L647949,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Don't.
299330,L647948,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
299331,L647947,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,Norman Spencer.
299332,L647946,u8867,m601,NORMAN,When's she out of here?
299333,L647944,u8867,m601,NORMAN,We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
299334,L647943,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,She's awake.
299335,L647942,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic."
299336,L647941,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,What's their name?
299337,L647940,u8867,m601,NORMAN,Three weeks.
299338,L647939,u8859,m601,CLAIRE,I think three...
299339,L647938,u8867,m601,NORMAN,"Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?"
299340,L649089,u8869,m602,NICK,":Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way."
299341,L649088,u8868,m602,MORGAN,":What do you mean ""They"" are? Are you officially a woman now?"
299342,L649087,u8869,m602,NICK,":Well, they are."
299343,L649086,u8868,m602,MORGAN,:Would you stop it!
299344,L649085,u8869,m602,NICK,":No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true."
299345,L649084,u8868,m602,MORGAN,":What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?"
299346,L650059,u8870,m603,AARON,"Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!"
299347,L650058,u8880,m603,ROWAN,But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
299348,L650057,u8870,m603,AARON,"You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!"
299349,L650055,u8880,m603,ROWAN,But why would they do that...?
299350,L650054,u8870,m603,AARON,With his hands!
299351,L649960,u8870,m603,AARON,Two heartbeats.
299352,L649959,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Two what...?
299353,L649958,u8870,m603,AARON,There are two.
299354,L649957,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
299355,L649956,u8870,m603,AARON,Are you alright...?  You look pale.
299356,L649818,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me."
299357,L649817,u8870,m603,AARON,"Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -"
299358,L649815,u8870,m603,AARON,But you've not told Michael.
299359,L649814,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I have seen him again.  Last night.
299360,L649794,u8870,m603,AARON,I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
299361,L649793,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
299362,L649792,u8870,m603,AARON,"Thank you for this honor, my dear."
299363,L649661,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
299364,L649660,u8870,m603,AARON,Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
299365,L649651,u8870,m603,AARON,A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
299366,L649650,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Then what is he...?
299367,L649649,u8870,m603,AARON,"Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith."
299368,L650156,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
299369,L650155,u8870,m603,AARON,Rowan...
299370,L650152,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
299371,L650151,u8870,m603,AARON,What are you talk---
299372,L650150,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
299373,L650141,u8870,m603,AARON,Every day  twice.
299374,L650140,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
299375,L650138,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
299376,L650137,u8870,m603,AARON,Nothing was ever more false.
299377,L650136,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
299378,L650053,u8870,m603,AARON,Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
299379,L650052,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"""Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."""
299380,L650051,u8870,m603,AARON,What have the witches always asked of you...?
299381,L650004,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?"
299382,L650003,u8870,m603,AARON,"Michael, Rowan should -"
299383,L650002,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Don't tell Rowan about this.
299384,L649752,u8870,m603,AARON,"Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael."
299385,L649751,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Rowan.
299386,L649750,u8870,m603,AARON,"There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?"
299387,L649749,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?"
299388,L649653,u8870,m603,AARON,A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
299389,L649652,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,A what...?
299390,L649520,u8870,m603,AARON,Come.  There is a lot to read
299391,L649519,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
299392,L649517,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
299393,L649516,u8870,m603,AARON,"I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours."
299394,L649511,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
299395,L649510,u8870,m603,AARON,With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
299396,L649509,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
299397,L649508,u8870,m603,AARON,"Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess."
299398,L649507,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
299399,L649952,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
299400,L649951,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere."
299401,L649787,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
299402,L649786,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Then you wear it.
299403,L649785,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
299404,L649784,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I don't want it.
299405,L649783,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,"Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -"
299406,L649719,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,"In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll."
299407,L649718,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
299408,L649717,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
299409,L649705,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Nothing worse than a common tool.
299410,L649704,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
299411,L649703,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
299412,L649702,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"He made that quite clear, yes."
299413,L649701,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,"I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life."
299414,L649480,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I want to see my mother.
299415,L649479,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
299416,L649802,u8875,m603,GIFFORD,"Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!"
299417,L649801,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
299418,L649800,u8875,m603,GIFFORD,"I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - ""make us rich"" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'"
299419,L649799,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
299420,L649497,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,"Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things"
299421,L649496,u8875,m603,GIFFORD,"In certain cases, hell is the operative word."
299422,L649495,u8871,m603,BEATRICE,"Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party."
299423,L649609,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
299424,L649608,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
299425,L649606,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?"
299426,L649605,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You - are - a - murderer.
299427,L649604,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
299428,L649603,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
299429,L649602,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
299430,L649599,u8880,m603,ROWAN,ENOUGH!!!
299431,L649598,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
299432,L649597,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Stop it!
299433,L649596,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
299434,L649595,u8880,m603,ROWAN,It wes a dream...!
299435,L649594,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,Lasher touched you and you loved it.
299436,L649591,u8880,m603,ROWAN,'He'...?
299437,L649590,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
299438,L649589,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?"
299439,L649588,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
299440,L649587,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon."
299441,L649586,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You're a monster.
299442,L649585,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,She didn't feel them
299443,L649584,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
299444,L649573,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-"
299445,L649572,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Better than most, I suppose."
299446,L649571,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"You can see well in the dark, Rowan."
299447,L649570,u8880,m603,ROWAN,The lamplight.  That's all.
299448,L649569,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,What is it...?
299449,L649546,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,And this - if you decide to take the rest.
299450,L649545,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Eighty million doll --- ?
299451,L649544,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now."
299452,L649543,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I don't want the -
299453,L649526,u8880,m603,ROWAN,There are things I have to know!
299454,L649525,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,I'm tired.  I need to rest.
299455,L649524,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
299456,L649523,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
299457,L649522,u8880,m603,ROWAN,She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
299458,L649486,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?"
299459,L649485,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
299460,L649484,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear."
299461,L649454,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!"
299462,L649453,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -"
299463,L649452,u8880,m603,ROWAN,When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
299464,L649451,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
299465,L649450,u8880,m603,ROWAN,What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
299466,L649449,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,"It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -"
299467,L649448,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Who the hel1 -

299475,L649440,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -"
299476,L649439,u8872,m603,CARLOTTA,This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.

299505,L650191,u8876,m603,LASHER,Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
299506,L650190,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Oh god...
299507,L650189,u8876,m603,LASHER,"They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter..."
299508,L650188,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!"
299509,L650187,u8876,m603,LASHER,"It was an accident.   Gifford, too."
299510,L650186,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?"
299511,L650111,u8876,m603,LASHER,"Tell me what I am, Rowan."
299512,L650110,u8880,m603,ROWAN,No!
299513,L650105,u8876,m603,LASHER,"That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am."
299514,L650104,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I don't know what you are!!!
299515,L650103,u8876,m603,LASHER,There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
299516,L650102,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
299517,L650101,u8876,m603,LASHER,I do not understand...
299518,L650100,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
299519,L650099,u8876,m603,LASHER,What is wrong...?
299520,L650098,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Leave me alone!
299521,L650097,u8876,m603,LASHER,Go on. Rowan.  Go on.

299524,L650076,u8876,m603,LASHER,"Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me..."
299525,L650075,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
299526,L650074,u8876,m603,LASHER,Then help me--- for his sake...
299527,L650073,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I love Michael...
299528,L650072,u8876,m603,LASHER,--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
299529,L650070,u8880,m603,ROWAN,But have I...?  Ever...?!
299530,L650069,u8876,m603,LASHER,I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
299531,L650066,u8876,m603,LASHER,"No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me."
299532,L650065,u8880,m603,ROWAN,And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
299533,L650064,u8876,m603,LASHER,I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
299534,L650063,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I know that you're evil.
299535,L649989,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
299536,L649988,u8876,m603,LASHER,Do not tell me that!
299537,L649987,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I LOVE him!
299538,L649986,u8876,m603,LASHER,But I could understand. I want to understand!
299539,L649985,u8880,m603,ROWAN,What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
299540,L649984,u8876,m603,LASHER,you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
299541,L649982,u8880,m603,ROWAN,It's too soon to know.
299542,L649981,u8876,m603,LASHER,A girl...?
299543,L649980,u8876,m603,LASHER,"From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child..."
299544,L649979,u8880,m603,ROWAN,It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
299545,L649978,u8876,m603,LASHER,"If that were true, I would not be here."
299546,L649977,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Go away!  I don't want you here.
299547,L649976,u8876,m603,LASHER,There is no one here but the dead.
299548,L649975,u8876,m603,LASHER,I bring her flowers too.
299549,L649974,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---"
299550,L649940,u8876,m603,LASHER,"I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?"
299551,L649939,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"You're very clever, aren't you...?"
299552,L649938,u8876,m603,LASHER,
299553,L649937,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?"
299554,L649936,u8876,m603,LASHER,"If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel..."
299555,L649935,u8876,m603,LASHER,If you knew how I yearn for that...
299556,L649934,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"To love, you must be able to feel."
299557,L649933,u8876,m603,LASHER,It is from love.

299628,L649894,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
299629,L649893,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Talking to me dear...?
299630,L649892,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"You did that, didn't you...?"
299631,L649887,u8880,m603,ROWAN,That's not funny.
299632,L649886,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
299633,L649885,u8880,m603,ROWAN,That's cause we're below sea level.
299634,L649884,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin."
299635,L649879,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I love you too.

299638,L649876,u8880,m603,ROWAN,No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
299639,L649856,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Michael!
299640,L649855,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Did you see the old man on the ---

299647,L649838,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,You look a little green.

299649,L649777,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Hey - you're bleeding.

299652,L649764,u8880,m603,ROWAN,So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
299653,L649763,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Their what...?
299654,L649762,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
299655,L649760,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?"
299656,L649759,u8880,m603,ROWAN,That's GREAT!
299657,L649758,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
299658,L649757,u8880,m603,ROWAN,And I thought I was the mindreader.
299659,L649756,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
299660,L649755,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor."
299661,L649754,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael."
299662,L649733,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know."
299663,L649732,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?"
299664,L649729,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes."
299665,L649728,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU."
299666,L649727,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I don't think of us that way - ever.
299667,L649726,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Ro, how long have we known each other."
299668,L649725,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"If we married, we'd shut him out forever."
299669,L649724,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Maybe he's just - waiting...
299670,L649723,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in."
299671,L649722,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
299672,L649709,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---"
299673,L649708,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Hello..
299674,L649707,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Everyone - this is Michael curry.
299675,L649693,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
299676,L649692,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You sure...?
299677,L649691,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Let's see.
299678,L649690,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
299679,L649665,u8880,m603,ROWAN,They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
299680,L649664,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,What about your work back home...?
299681,L649663,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
299682,L649662,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
299683,L649659,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you."
299684,L649658,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
299685,L649657,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Do you love me, Michael...?"
299686,L649656,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -"
299687,L649655,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
299688,L649654,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here."
299689,L649643,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?"
299690,L649642,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!"
299691,L649641,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!"
299692,L649640,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
299693,L649638,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?"
299694,L649637,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
299695,L649636,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
299696,L649635,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
299697,L649633,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,- a witch.
299698,L649632,u8880,m603,ROWAN,She - she said I - I was a ---
299699,L649631,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
299700,L649630,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You know...?
299701,L649465,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Goodbye, Michael.   I love you."
299702,L649464,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
299703,L649463,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
299704,L649462,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,What about you coming down here...?
299705,L649461,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
299706,L649460,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,What's wrong..?
299707,L649459,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael..."
299708,L649458,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Rowan...?
299709,L649457,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -

299712,L649418,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"We're quite a pair, you and I."
299713,L649417,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
299714,L649416,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,
299715,L649415,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?"
299716,L649414,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"God knows, I'm intriguing."
299717,L649413,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned."
299718,L649412,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
299719,L649411,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Seems more like a year than a month.
299720,L649407,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work."
299721,L649406,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Stop it.
299722,L649405,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -"
299723,L649404,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I'm serious.  You don't -
299724,L649403,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
299725,L649402,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -"
299726,L649401,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
299727,L649400,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,All I meant was -
299728,L649399,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there."
299729,L649397,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Captain's orders.
299730,L649396,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Doctor's orders- - -?
299731,L649395,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
299732,L649394,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Why don't you let at do that...?
299733,L649392,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah."
299734,L649391,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence."
299735,L649390,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!"
299736,L649389,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
299737,L649386,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?"
299738,L649385,u8880,m603,ROWAN,you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
299739,L649384,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,He fools around with his patients too.
299740,L649383,u8880,m603,ROWAN,He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
299741,L649380,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
299742,L649379,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Too much... too fast...?
299743,L649378,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
299744,L649377,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Really...?  Your family there...?
299745,L649376,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I was born, in New Orleans, too-"
299746,L649374,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You still feel that crazy...?
299747,L649373,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
299748,L649372,u8880,m603,ROWAN,And whose houses do you design...?
299749,L649371,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
299750,L649367,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
299751,L649366,u8880,m603,ROWAN,It's unbelievable that you can do that.
299752,L649365,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you..."
299753,L649364,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year."
299754,L649363,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
299755,L649362,u8880,m603,ROWAN,What else did you see- Michael...?
299756,L649361,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
299757,L649360,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,you're very --- different.
299758,L649359,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Yessssss...
299759,L649358,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
299760,L649357,u8880,m603,ROWAN,HARDER!
299761,L649356,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Rowan...
299762,L649355,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Harder...
299763,L649348,u8880,m603,ROWAN,No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
299764,L649347,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -"
299765,L649346,u8880,m603,ROWAN,You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
299766,L649345,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,The one time I want it to work...
299767,L649344,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Just one.  The bar's closed.
299768,L649343,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
299769,L649342,u8880,m603,ROWAN,What do you see...?
299770,L649339,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it."
299771,L649338,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
299772,L649336,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
299773,L649335,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"My jury's still out on that,"
299774,L649334,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I'm glad you're around to say it.
299775,L649333,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?"
299776,L649332,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
299777,L649331,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
299778,L649330,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office..."
299779,L649329,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,They like you ------- kids.
299780,L650085,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Just don't fall off any ladders.
299781,L650084,u8883,m603,STU,"A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance."
299782,L650019,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
299783,L650018,u8883,m603,STU,Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
299784,L650017,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I'm getting --- left behind.
299785,L649780,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?"
299786,L649779,u8883,m603,STU,You okay...?
299787,L649677,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,If you like that type.
299788,L649676,u8883,m603,STU,Wow...
299789,L649674,u8883,m603,STU,That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
299790,L649673,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
299791,L649672,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
299792,L649671,u8883,m603,STU,"Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?"
299793,L649315,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Go away, GODDAMNIT!"
299794,L649314,u8883,m603,STU,You can't just -
299795,L649313,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,On which planet...?
299796,L649312,u8883,m603,STU,Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
299797,L649311,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,"Go home, Stu  I'll call you."
299798,L649274,u8879,m603,MICHAEL,I just - hate it when they're - finished.
299799,L649273,u8883,m603,STU,sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
299800,L650087,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
299801,L650086,u8883,m603,STU,"Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?"
299802,L649910,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Is that what you were doing...?
299803,L649909,u8883,m603,STU,Is that a crack about our singing...?
299804,L649908,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
299805,L649684,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I like him.  He can stay.
299806,L649683,u8883,m603,STU,Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
299807,L649682,u8880,m603,ROWAN,He's got great hands.
299808,L649681,u8883,m603,STU,You really love this guy...?
299809,L649680,u8880,m603,ROWAN,"I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?"
299810,L649679,u8883,m603,STU,Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
299811,L649678,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Rowan Mayfair.
299812,L649743,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
299813,L649742,u8882,m603,RYAN,That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
299814,L649741,u8880,m603,ROWAN,No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
299815,L649740,u8882,m603,RYAN,"That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -"
299816,L649739,u8880,m603,ROWAN,I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
299817,L649738,u8882,m603,RYAN,"Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -"
299818,L649737,u8880,m603,ROWAN,Papers...?
299819,L649736,u8882,m603,RYAN,We'd better get to work on the papers.
299820,L650415,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,"Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?"
299821,L650414,u8885,m604,CARTER,Sounds good - thank you
299822,L650413,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
299823,L650412,u8885,m604,CARTER,"I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?"
299824,L650411,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,"Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?"
299825,L650410,u8885,m604,CARTER,I thought you were someone else
299826,L650409,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,A person could get killed round here just for working late
299827,L650408,u8885,m604,CARTER,I'm sorry - I didn't think
299828,L650407,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,OH MY GAWD!
299829,L650274,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,"Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for..."
299830,L650273,u8885,m604,CARTER,I heard something like that
299831,L650272,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
299832,L650271,u8885,m604,CARTER,That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
299833,L650269,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
299834,L650268,u8885,m604,CARTER,I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
299835,L650267,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,Don't give me shit - what do you want?
299836,L650266,u8885,m604,CARTER,The one on the left - definitely...
299837,L650265,u8886,m604,DEZERAE,Which do you think is her best shot...
299838,L650733,u8885,m604,CARTER,Yes - I have had it for years.
299839,L650732,u8887,m604,MANAGER,This must be one of the old keys -
299840,L650728,u8885,m604,CARTER,I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
299841,L650727,u8887,m604,MANAGER,I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
299842,L650726,u8885,m604,CARTER,Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
299843,L650725,u8887,m604,MANAGER,I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
299844,L650723,u8885,m604,CARTER,No - I've been abroad for a long time...
299845,L650722,u8887,m604,MANAGER,Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
299846,L650674,u8885,m604,CARTER,I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
299847,L650673,u8887,m604,MANAGER,No - not all the time - I mean
299848,L650672,u8885,m604,CARTER,All the time?
299849,L650671,u8887,m604,MANAGER,No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
299850,L650670,u8885,m604,CARTER,"Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job"
299851,L650668,u8887,m604,MANAGER,"I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then."
299852,L650667,u8885,m604,CARTER,And it can't be forged?
299853,L650666,u8887,m604,MANAGER,That's right...
299854,L650665,u8885,m604,CARTER,So there is only one key...
299855,L650664,u8887,m604,MANAGER,Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
299856,L650663,u8885,m604,CARTER,"Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?"
299857,L650662,u8887,m604,MANAGER,Yes it is...
299858,L650661,u8885,m604,CARTER,Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
299859,L650656,u8885,m604,CARTER,But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
299860,L650655,u8887,m604,MANAGER,BRIAN...
299861,L650654,u8885,m604,CARTER,That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
299862,L650653,u8887,m604,MANAGER,"Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points..."
299863,L650652,u8885,m604,CARTER,When could I look round?
299864,L650650,u8885,m604,CARTER,Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
299865,L650649,u8887,m604,MANAGER,CHIC MAGAZINE?
299866,L650648,u8885,m604,CARTER,"You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE"

299871,L650740,u8885,m604,CARTER,You killed my friend!

299882,L650692,u8889,m604,STECKLER,What was I supposed to do?
299883,L650691,u8885,m604,CARTER,Why did you let him in?
299884,L650687,u8885,m604,CARTER,He doesn't need to...
299885,L650686,u8889,m604,STECKLER,First finish your tea...

299902,L650624,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful..."
299903,L650623,u8885,m604,CARTER,What's wrong?
299904,L650567,u8885,m604,CARTER,Nothing could be better...
299905,L650566,u8889,m604,STECKLER,What's wrong?
299906,L650565,u8889,m604,STECKLER,Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
299907,L650564,u8885,m604,CARTER,Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
299908,L650563,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me..."
299909,L650562,u8885,m604,CARTER,What?
299910,L650560,u8885,m604,CARTER,Then make it stop...
299911,L650559,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I want it to stop - it all to stop...
299912,L650558,u8889,m604,STECKLER,It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
299913,L650557,u8885,m604,CARTER,What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
299914,L650556,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me..."
299915,L650555,u8885,m604,CARTER,Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
299916,L650554,u8889,m604,STECKLER,My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
299917,L650553,u8885,m604,CARTER,STEPHANIE?
299918,L650552,u8889,m604,STECKLER,No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
299919,L650550,u8885,m604,CARTER,Did you?
299920,L650549,u8889,m604,STECKLER,You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
299921,L650546,u8885,m604,CARTER,Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
299922,L650545,u8889,m604,STECKLER,My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
299923,L650537,u8885,m604,CARTER,Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
299924,L650536,u8889,m604,STECKLER,And how did it feel to be rid of him
299925,L650531,u8889,m604,STECKLER,Why not? Please - it would help me
299926,L650530,u8885,m604,CARTER,Why should I?
299927,L650529,u8889,m604,STECKLER,Tell me how it happened...
299928,L650527,u8885,m604,CARTER,"That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -"
299929,L650526,u8889,m604,STECKLER,You've killed but you're not a killer
299930,L650525,u8885,m604,CARTER,I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
299931,L650524,u8889,m604,STECKLER,You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
299932,L650520,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came"
299933,L650519,u8885,m604,CARTER,What didn't you like about her?
299934,L650518,u8889,m604,STECKLER,It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
299935,L650517,u8885,m604,CARTER,then why did you marry her -
299936,L650516,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me..."
299937,L650515,u8885,m604,CARTER,Tell me about your wife...
299938,L650514,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I have something I have to show you...
299939,L650513,u8885,m604,CARTER,How long have you been watching me?
299940,L650492,u8889,m604,STECKLER,Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
299941,L650491,u8885,m604,CARTER,Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
299942,L650490,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?"
299943,L650489,u8885,m604,CARTER,Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
299944,L650488,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I don't know...
299945,L650487,u8885,m604,CARTER,"Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?"
299946,L650486,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I don't know...
299947,L650485,u8885,m604,CARTER,"OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair..."
299948,L650484,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I don't want to talk about it -
299949,L650483,u8885,m604,CARTER,The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
299950,L650482,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them!"
299951,L650481,u8885,m604,CARTER,What did you do with her?
299952,L650480,u8889,m604,STECKLER,No she didn't...
299953,L650479,u8885,m604,CARTER,Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
299954,L650478,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -"
299955,L650477,u8885,m604,CARTER,I don't know
299956,L650476,u8889,m604,STECKLER,my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
299957,L650475,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of"
299958,L650474,u8885,m604,CARTER,Where do you kill them...
299959,L650473,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't"
299960,L650472,u8885,m604,CARTER,You don't know?
299961,L650471,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I don't know
299962,L650470,u8885,m604,CARTER,And how many people have you killed?
299963,L650469,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Oh, about six years since I graduated"
299964,L650468,u8885,m604,CARTER,And how long have you been a dentist?
299965,L650467,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I'm a dentist
299966,L650466,u8885,m604,CARTER,So what do you do?
299967,L650457,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Yes, one and a half please."
299968,L650456,u8885,m604,CARTER,Sugar?
299969,L650436,u8885,m604,CARTER,I think I will pass...
299970,L650435,u8889,m604,STECKLER,If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
299971,L650335,u8885,m604,CARTER,Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
299972,L650334,u8889,m604,STECKLER,Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
299973,L650333,u8885,m604,CARTER,My names isn't ANGELA...
299974,L650332,u8889,m604,STECKLER,It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
299975,L650331,u8885,m604,CARTER,What's with all the locks - and hammering
299976,L650330,u8889,m604,STECKLER,I'm sorry?
299977,L650329,u8885,m604,CARTER,What are you doing?
299978,L650326,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book"
299979,L650325,u8885,m604,CARTER,Do you take sugar?
299980,L650322,u8889,m604,STECKLER,The touch?
299981,L650321,u8885,m604,CARTER,I lost the touch
299982,L650317,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?"
299983,L650316,u8885,m604,CARTER,Sure...
299984,L650315,u8889,m604,STECKLER,"Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?"
299985,L650294,u8885,m604,CARTER,I really don't know what to say
299986,L650293,u8889,m604,STECKLER,It doesn't mention 'females only'
299987,L650757,u8888,m604,MIK,He saved my life you know - has he told you...
299988,L650756,u8885,m604,CARTER,No he had to - he's just - he's out...
299989,L650755,u8888,m604,MIK,Is LESLIE here?
299990,L650754,u8885,m604,CARTER,I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
299991,L650753,u8888,m604,MIK,What happened?
299992,L650450,u8885,m604,CARTER,I'm your landlady
299993,L650449,u8888,m604,MIK,Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
299994,L650448,u8885,m604,CARTER,I want you out now
299995,L650445,u8885,m604,CARTER,Yes I can...
299996,L650444,u8888,m604,MIK,You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
299997,L650443,u8885,m604,CARTER,You heard me - keep away from him
299998,L650442,u8888,m604,MIK,What?
299999,L650441,u8885,m604,CARTER,I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
300000,L650440,u8888,m604,MIK,What's wrong with you?
300001,L650303,u8888,m604,MIK,I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
300002,L650302,u8885,m604,CARTER,Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
300003,L650301,u8888,m604,MIK,I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
300004,L650300,u8885,m604,CARTER,"Well, what do you think?"

300006,L650285,u8888,m604,MIK,"I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?"
300007,L650685,u8885,m604,CARTER,I think you had better leave
300008,L650684,u8890,m604,TAYLOR,I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
300009,L650384,u8885,m604,CARTER,Get out...

300011,L650382,u8885,m604,CARTER,At home alone - where were you?
300012,L650381,u8890,m604,TAYLOR,It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
300013,L650380,u8885,m604,CARTER,You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
300014,L650379,u8890,m604,TAYLOR,I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
300015,L650378,u8885,m604,CARTER,What brings the rats out of the sewers?

300267,L651972,u8902,m605,TED,It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.

300318,L652044,u8903,m605,TOM,We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
300319,L652043,u8895,m605,HEATHER,But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
300320,L652042,u8903,m605,TOM,"If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?"

300353,L652593,u8898,m605,JIMMY,"But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids."
300354,L652592,u8898,m605,JIMMY,Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
300355,L652591,u8902,m605,TED,That's a crappy thing to say.

300364,L652582,u8898,m605,JIMMY,Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
300365,L652581,u8902,m605,TED,"That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff."

All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette."

300761,L655379,u8915,m606,RUBY,You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
300762,L655378,u8915,m606,RUBY,Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
300763,L655377,u8909,m606,GLORIA,What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
300764,L655376,u8915,m606,RUBY,Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.

300776,L654823,u8912,m606,KELLY,Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
300777,L654822,u8909,m606,GLORIA,Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
300778,L654821,u8912,m606,KELLY,"He said something like, ""Do you want it dirty7"" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor."

300784,L654812,u8912,m606,KELLY,I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.

300840,L655122,u8914,m606,RAY,"I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it."

300844,L655117,u8914,m606,RAY,The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
300845,L655116,u8909,m606,GLORIA,"Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing..."
300846,L655115,u8914,m606,RAY,"They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start."
300847,L655114,u8914,m606,RAY,Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.

300849,L655112,u8914,m606,RAY,"I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless..."
300850,L655111,u8909,m606,GLORIA,Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
300851,L655110,u8914,m606,RAY,"Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place."
300852,L655107,u8909,m606,GLORIA,Lombardo's settlement?

300855,L654953,u8909,m606,GLORIA,That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
300856,L654952,u8909,m606,GLORIA,You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
300857,L654951,u8914,m606,RAY,This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.

300861,L654946,u8909,m606,GLORIA,You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
300862,L654942,u8909,m606,GLORIA,"All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid."
300863,L654941,u8914,m606,RAY,You're telling me you believe the guy?

Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his."
300865,L654936,u8914,m606,RAY,Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
300866,L654935,u8909,m606,GLORIA,Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
300867,L654851,u8909,m606,GLORIA,Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
300868,L654850,u8914,m606,RAY,"It's our job, Gloria."
300869,L654845,u8909,m606,GLORIA,"All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here."
300870,L654844,u8914,m606,RAY,That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?

300876,L654999,u8918,m606,SUZIE,No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
300877,L654998,u8909,m606,GLORIA,At that point were you able to fight him off?

300894,L654846,u8910,m606,HUNTER,I want a full-scale investigation.
300895,L654843,u8909,m606,GLORIA,I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.

300897,L654841,u8909,m606,GLORIA,That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
300898,L654838,u8909,m606,GLORIA,I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
300899,L654837,u8910,m606,HUNTER,Why?
300900,L655362,u8910,m606,HUNTER,Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
300901,L655361,u8914,m606,RAY,"The teeth, were they..."
300902,L655359,u8914,m606,RAY,"She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest."
300903,L655358,u8910,m606,HUNTER,You didn't cuff her?
300904,L655357,u8914,m606,RAY,"I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together."
300905,L655356,u8914,m606,RAY,"Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom."
300906,L655355,u8910,m606,HUNTER,She bit you?
300907,L655353,u8914,m606,RAY,I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
300908,L655352,u8910,m606,HUNTER,Just tell us what happened.
300909,L655351,u8914,m606,RAY,"I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?"
300910,L655293,u8910,m606,HUNTER,"Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me."
300911,L655292,u8914,m606,RAY,"Kelly's next, Gloria."
300912,L655209,u8914,m606,RAY,"You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead..."
300913,L655208,u8910,m606,HUNTER,"Oh, Ray... no..."
300914,L655204,u8914,m606,RAY,"I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money."
300915,L655203,u8910,m606,HUNTER,"Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick..."
300916,L655202,u8914,m606,RAY,"You heard Kelly say ""Sam.""  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls..."
300917,L655201,u8910,m606,HUNTER,"Are you crazy, Ray?"
300918,L654934,u8910,m606,HUNTER,And what do they say?
300919,L654933,u8914,m606,RAY,"We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops."
300920,L654932,u8910,m606,HUNTER,What about witnesses?
300921,L654931,u8914,m606,RAY,"Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit."
300922,L654840,u8910,m606,HUNTER,"The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay."
300923,L654839,u8914,m606,RAY,Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
300924,L655037,u8910,m606,HUNTER,Your Honor... Please...
300925,L655036,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed."
300926,L655026,u8910,m606,HUNTER,I'm sorry?
300927,L655025,u8918,m606,SUZIE,This wasn't my idea.
300928,L655024,u8910,m606,HUNTER,"Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?"
300929,L655023,u8918,m606,SUZIE,I said he did.
300930,L655022,u8910,m606,HUNTER,Ms. Toller?
300931,L655020,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
300932,L655019,u8910,m606,HUNTER,I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
300933,L655018,u8918,m606,SUZIE,He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
300934,L654997,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?"
300935,L654996,u8910,m606,HUNTER,Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
300936,L654995,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway..."
300937,L654994,u8910,m606,HUNTER,What did you do then?
300938,L654991,u8918,m606,SUZIE,I wanna go home now.
300939,L654990,u8910,m606,HUNTER,And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
300940,L654989,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Yeah... okay... he did
300941,L654988,u8910,m606,HUNTER,You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
300942,L654711,u8911,m606,JIMMY,Yeah.  But I got my bike.
300943,L654710,u8916,m606,SAM,A ride.  You want one?
300944,L654709,u8911,m606,JIMMY,What?
300945,L654708,u8916,m606,SAM,"What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?"
300946,L654700,u8916,m606,SAM,"Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be."
300947,L654699,u8911,m606,JIMMY,"You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees..."
300948,L654674,u8911,m606,JIMMY,"Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate."
300949,L654673,u8916,m606,SAM,"Thank you, Jimmy."
300950,L654672,u8911,m606,JIMMY,No!
300951,L654671,u8916,m606,SAM,"Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?"
300952,L655277,u8911,m606,JIMMY,"Yeah, but..."
300953,L655276,u8914,m606,RAY,"Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys..."
300954,L655275,u8911,m606,JIMMY,No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
300955,L655274,u8914,m606,RAY,I say something funny?
300956,L655273,u8914,m606,RAY,Lombardo ever come out here?
300957,L655272,u8911,m606,JIMMY,"Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?"
300958,L655271,u8914,m606,RAY,You and Suzie used to come out here together?
300959,L655270,u8911,m606,JIMMY,"It's those rocks, up there."
300960,L655235,u8912,m606,KELLY,Shit.
300961,L655234,u8918,m606,SUZIE,I wanna live at the beach someday.
300962,L655233,u8912,m606,KELLY,I think we just need to get wasted.
300963,L655232,u8918,m606,SUZIE,I thought we were goin' to a movie.
300964,L655231,u8912,m606,KELLY,Nothing.
300965,L655230,u8918,m606,SUZIE,What are you looking at?
300966,L655229,u8918,m606,SUZIE,What brain?
300967,L655228,u8912,m606,KELLY,Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
300968,L655195,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp..."
300969,L655194,u8918,m606,SUZIE,You are.
300970,L655193,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Oh, for Christ's sake."
300971,L655192,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?"
300972,L655174,u8912,m606,KELLY,You can trust me.
300973,L655173,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust."
300974,L655172,u8912,m606,KELLY,I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
300975,L655145,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Man, I wanna smoke a joint."
300976,L655144,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit."
300977,L655143,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me..."
300978,L655142,u8912,m606,KELLY,Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
300979,L655253,u8914,m606,RAY,I'm not on your property!
300980,L655252,u8912,m606,KELLY,Get off my property.
300981,L655138,u8912,m606,KELLY,Police -- God -- get a life.
300982,L655137,u8914,m606,RAY,"Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly."
300983,L655136,u8914,m606,RAY,"I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?"
300984,L655135,u8912,m606,KELLY,You're out of your mind.
300985,L655134,u8914,m606,RAY,"The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out."
300986,L655133,u8914,m606,RAY,You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
300987,L655132,u8912,m606,KELLY,Excuse me?
300988,L655130,u8912,m606,KELLY,About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
300989,L655129,u8914,m606,RAY,"Curiosity, I guess."
300990,L655128,u8912,m606,KELLY,Is there some reason why you're here?
300991,L655269,u8912,m606,KELLY,A friend of mine bought a boat.
300992,L655268,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"Where, the mall?"
300993,L655267,u8912,m606,KELLY,Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
300994,L655266,u8917,m606,SANDRA,I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
300995,L655265,u8912,m606,KELLY,"You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me..."
300996,L654802,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Yes.  God, Mom..."
300997,L654801,u8917,m606,SANDRA,He... Sam Lombardo?
300998,L654800,u8912,m606,KELLY,I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
300999,L654799,u8917,m606,SANDRA,What?
301000,L654794,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married."
301001,L654793,u8912,m606,KELLY,No you don't.
301002,L654792,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes..."
301003,L654791,u8912,m606,KELLY,I miss Dad.
301004,L654790,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Kelly.  What is it?
301005,L654788,u8912,m606,KELLY,No thanks to you.
301006,L654787,u8917,m606,SANDRA,I would hardly say you look like trash.
301007,L654786,u8912,m606,KELLY,"My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash."
301008,L654785,u8912,m606,KELLY,You notice my new jumper?
301009,L654784,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"Okay, what's the matter?"
301010,L654783,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Whichever one I want.
301011,L654782,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Which one of your ""bodyguards"" is that?"
301012,L654720,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Sam!  Hi!
301013,L654719,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Hi, Mon."
301014,L654718,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Is that Sam Lombardo?
301015,L655455,u8912,m606,KELLY,Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
301016,L655454,u8916,m606,SAM,You think that's wise?
301017,L655453,u8912,m606,KELLY,I'm running away.
301018,L655441,u8912,m606,KELLY,No little girl can ever make me come.
301019,L655440,u8916,m606,SAM,I love you.  Now give me the line.
301020,L655439,u8912,m606,KELLY,Say you love me.
301021,L655438,u8916,m606,SAM,That's not your line.
301022,L655437,u8912,m606,KELLY,That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
301023,L655319,u8912,m606,KELLY,Okay.  I love you too.
301024,L655318,u8916,m606,SAM,"So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you."
301025,L655317,u8912,m606,KELLY,"But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber..."
301026,L655316,u8916,m606,SAM,Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
301027,L655315,u8912,m606,KELLY,I don't know.  I want to see you...
301028,L655314,u8916,m606,SAM,And you believe her?
301029,L655313,u8912,m606,KELLY,I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
301030,L655312,u8916,m606,SAM,"Yeah, he got her busted for possession..."
301031,L655311,u8912,m606,KELLY,I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
301032,L655310,u8916,m606,SAM,Duquette.  Forget him...
301033,L655309,u8912,m606,KELLY,"I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me."
301034,L655308,u8912,m606,KELLY,"God, I've been calling you."
301035,L655307,u8916,m606,SAM,Hello.
301036,L655306,u8912,m606,KELLY,Hello?
301037,L655248,u8912,m606,KELLY,There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
301038,L655247,u8916,m606,SAM,"I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it..."
301039,L655186,u8916,m606,SAM,"Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds."
301040,L655185,u8912,m606,KELLY,I'm here.
301041,L655181,u8916,m606,SAM,Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
301042,L655180,u8912,m606,KELLY,You know what it takes.
301043,L655179,u8916,m606,SAM,"No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes..."
301044,L655178,u8912,m606,KELLY,Why can't you come...
301045,L655177,u8916,m606,SAM,Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
301046,L655176,u8912,m606,KELLY,Yes.
301047,L655175,u8916,m606,SAM,Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
301048,L655105,u8912,m606,KELLY,Stick?
301049,L655104,u8916,m606,SAM,We have to stick with the plan.
301050,L655103,u8912,m606,KELLY,Do it to ourselves?
301051,L655102,u8916,m606,SAM,"The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves..."
301052,L655100,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party."
301053,L655099,u8916,m606,SAM,"From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood..."
301054,L655095,u8912,m606,KELLY,Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
301055,L655094,u8916,m606,SAM,"God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here."
301056,L655089,u8916,m606,SAM,About six and a half million dollars.
301057,L655088,u8912,m606,KELLY,How much?
301058,L655086,u8912,m606,KELLY,So you got my mom's money.
301059,L655085,u8916,m606,SAM,"Jesus Christ, what are you doing?"
301060,L655074,u8916,m606,SAM,"Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning."
301061,L655073,u8912,m606,KELLY,Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
301062,L655072,u8916,m606,SAM,Kelly...
301063,L654754,u8912,m606,KELLY,Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
301064,L654753,u8916,m606,SAM,All right.  I'll have to look for it.
301065,L654752,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo."
301066,L654751,u8916,m606,SAM,"Jeez, that thing... Can't you..."
301067,L654750,u8912,m606,KELLY,Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
301068,L654749,u8916,m606,SAM,"So, where you off to now?"
301069,L654743,u8916,m606,SAM,In back of the garage.
301070,L654742,u8912,m606,KELLY,Where's the hose?  We can set up.
301071,L654740,u8916,m606,SAM,No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
301072,L654739,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Look, he forgot.  I knew it."
301073,L654717,u8916,m606,SAM,I won't.
301074,L654716,u8912,m606,KELLY,Don't forget the car wash.
301075,L654706,u8912,m606,KELLY,"Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?"
301076,L654705,u8916,m606,SAM,"Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off."
301077,L655046,u8913,m606,KEN,"Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro."
301078,L655045,u8916,m606,SAM,Just like that?
301079,L655044,u8913,m606,KEN,"You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan."
301080,L655043,u8916,m606,SAM,I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
301081,L655042,u8913,m606,KEN,"Come on, let loose!"
301082,L654899,u8913,m606,KEN,Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
301083,L654898,u8916,m606,SAM,I just want my life back...
301084,L654897,u8913,m606,KEN,"Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution..."
301085,L654896,u8916,m606,SAM,There's nothing for them to get.
301086,L654895,u8913,m606,KEN,"Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right."
301087,L654894,u8916,m606,SAM,Nellie Gail Ranch...
301088,L654893,u8913,m606,KEN,"For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless."
301089,L654892,u8916,m606,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
301090,L654891,u8913,m606,KEN,"You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan."
301091,L654890,u8913,m606,KEN,Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
301092,L654889,u8916,m606,SAM,Can't you take that stupid thing off?
301093,L654888,u8916,m606,SAM,"I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?"
301094,L654887,u8913,m606,KEN,Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
301095,L654886,u8916,m606,SAM,Forget it.
301096,L654885,u8913,m606,KEN,You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
301097,L654884,u8916,m606,SAM,Good thinking.
301098,L654868,u8916,m606,SAM,Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
301099,L654867,u8913,m606,KEN,But check this...
301100,L655350,u8914,m606,RAY,"Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way."
301101,L655349,u8917,m606,SANDRA,You can't...
301102,L655348,u8914,m606,RAY,I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
301103,L655347,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
301104,L655346,u8914,m606,RAY,Where is she?
301105,L655345,u8914,m606,RAY,"Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now."
301106,L655344,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Who is it?
301107,L654805,u8917,m606,SANDRA,That's right.
301108,L654804,u8914,m606,RAY,You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
301109,L655406,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?"
301110,L655405,u8914,m606,RAY,"Sam, for godsake."
301111,L655402,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water."
301112,L655401,u8914,m606,RAY,You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
301113,L655168,u8914,m606,RAY,That's right.  That was his name.
301114,L655167,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Davy.
301115,L655164,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Shut up.
301116,L655163,u8914,m606,RAY,"Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?"
301117,L655162,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Get away from me.
301118,L655159,u8914,m606,RAY,"Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit..."
301119,L655158,u8918,m606,SUZIE,I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
301120,L655157,u8914,m606,RAY,Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
301121,L655156,u8918,m606,SUZIE,I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
301122,L655155,u8914,m606,RAY,"You, Kelly, Sam."
301123,L655154,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
301124,L655153,u8914,m606,RAY,Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
301125,L655152,u8918,m606,SUZIE,About what?
301126,L655151,u8914,m606,RAY,"Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me."
301127,L655150,u8918,m606,SUZIE,That's cop bullshit.
301128,L655149,u8914,m606,RAY,"Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you..."
301129,L655148,u8918,m606,SUZIE,You got something against cigarettes?
301130,L655147,u8914,m606,RAY,"You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser."
301131,L654971,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
301132,L654970,u8914,m606,RAY,It doesn't look like it.
301133,L654969,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Will they?
301134,L654968,u8914,m606,RAY,No.
301135,L654966,u8914,m606,RAY,"So Suzie, you called us, remember?"
301136,L654965,u8918,m606,SUZIE,It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
301137,L654963,u8918,m606,SUZIE,I did.  At Blue Balls.
301138,L654962,u8914,m606,RAY,"Meet my partner, Gloria Perez."
301139,L655397,u8916,m606,SAM,"Come off it, man... It was an accident."
301140,L655396,u8914,m606,RAY,"That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean..."
301141,L655395,u8916,m606,SAM,"Jesus, man... You okay?"
301142,L655394,u8914,m606,RAY,"Yeah, or get me drowned."
301143,L655393,u8916,m606,SAM,"Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet."
301144,L655392,u8914,m606,RAY,I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
301145,L655391,u8916,m606,SAM,"Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays."
301146,L655390,u8914,m606,RAY,You mean this thing?
301147,L655373,u8916,m606,SAM,"Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises."
301148,L655372,u8914,m606,RAY,"Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better."
301149,L655371,u8916,m606,SAM,"Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake."
301150,L655370,u8914,m606,RAY,"Hey, what did you want me to do, die?"
301151,L655369,u8914,m606,RAY,"The bitch shot me, is what happened."
301152,L655368,u8916,m606,SAM,"Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?"
301153,L654925,u8914,m606,RAY,"Sit down, Lombardo."
301154,L654924,u8916,m606,SAM,Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
301155,L654923,u8914,m606,RAY,With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
301156,L654922,u8916,m606,SAM,"It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying..."
301157,L654921,u8914,m606,RAY,"But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?"
301158,L654916,u8916,m606,SAM,That's right.
301159,L654915,u8914,m606,RAY,But she ran away.
301160,L654912,u8916,m606,SAM,"Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office."
301161,L654911,u8914,m606,RAY,And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
301162,L654910,u8916,m606,SAM,"I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place."
301163,L654909,u8914,m606,RAY,But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
301164,L654908,u8916,m606,SAM,Yes.
301165,L654907,u8914,m606,RAY,And she wanted to talk.
301166,L654906,u8916,m606,SAM,Yes.
301167,L654905,u8914,m606,RAY,"In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt."
301168,L654904,u8916,m606,SAM,"Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly."
301169,L654903,u8914,m606,RAY,The one you bought at school.
301170,L654902,u8916,m606,SAM,I had to go look for this coupon.
301171,L654901,u8916,m606,SAM,"Story's the same, Detective..."
301172,L654900,u8914,m606,RAY,"Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house."
301173,L655452,u8916,m606,SAM,"I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them."
301174,L655451,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?"
301175,L655450,u8916,m606,SAM,How...
301176,L655449,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already."
301177,L655448,u8916,m606,SAM,We?
301178,L655447,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?"
301179,L655444,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend."
301180,L655443,u8916,m606,SAM,"Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot."
301181,L655442,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
301182,L655420,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
301183,L655419,u8916,m606,SAM,What's wrong?
301184,L655415,u8916,m606,SAM,That was the same thing Ray said.
301185,L655414,u8918,m606,SUZIE,What?
301186,L655413,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends."
301187,L655412,u8916,m606,SAM,But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
301188,L655411,u8918,m606,SUZIE,The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
301189,L655410,u8916,m606,SAM,That was about as grim as it gets.
301190,L655242,u8916,m606,SAM,"No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight."
301191,L655241,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Are you mad at me?
301192,L655240,u8916,m606,SAM,"I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up."
301193,L655191,u8916,m606,SAM,"Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us."
301194,L655190,u8918,m606,SUZIE,"Yeah, right."
301195,L655188,u8916,m606,SAM,Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
301196,L655187,u8918,m606,SUZIE,But I..
301197,L655184,u8916,m606,SAM,Put Kelly on too.
301198,L655183,u8918,m606,SUZIE,Sam...
301199,L655097,u8916,m606,SAM,Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
301200,L655096,u8918,m606,SUZIE,How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
301201,L654778,u8916,m606,SAM,"Goodbye, Sandra."
301202,L654777,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts."
301203,L654775,u8916,m606,SAM,So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
301204,L654774,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
301205,L654772,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday."
301206,L654771,u8916,m606,SAM,Didn't you see her this morning?
301207,L654770,u8917,m606,SANDRA,Shit. Here we go again.
301208,L654769,u8916,m606,SAM,No.
301209,L654768,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?"
301210,L654767,u8916,m606,SAM,Sandy... What's up?
301211,L654730,u8916,m606,SAM,"Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time."
301212,L654729,u8917,m606,SANDRA,What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
301213,L654728,u8916,m606,SAM,"Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans."
301214,L654727,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out..."
301215,L654726,u8916,m606,SAM,"I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run."
301216,L654724,u8916,m606,SAM,Can't.  Got a passenger.
301217,L654723,u8917,m606,SANDRA,"Why don't you come in, have a drink?"
301218,L654722,u8916,m606,SAM,"Hi, Sandy."
301219,L654721,u8917,m606,SANDRA,What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
301220,L657170,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,I'm sure we will.
301221,L657169,u8923,m607,JIM,"Well, we'll stay in touch... you know."
301222,L657163,u8923,m607,JIM,"Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?"
301223,L657162,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,What is this?  A whole new train?
301224,L657161,u8923,m607,JIM,"Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling."
301225,L657151,u8923,m607,JIM,In the next two minutes?
301226,L657150,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam."
301227,L657149,u8923,m607,JIM,He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
301228,L657148,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
301229,L657121,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Oh, I see, an easy plan!"
301230,L657120,u8923,m607,JIM,Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
301231,L657115,u8923,m607,JIM,Where have you been?
301232,L657114,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,My God!  He's so excessive!
301233,L657078,u8923,m607,JIM,That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
301234,L657077,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"God in heaven, what is that?!"
301235,L657070,u8923,m607,JIM,Thank you.
301236,L657069,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"My hat is off to you, sir."
301237,L657066,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Of course not.
301238,L657065,u8923,m607,JIM,Are those just button buttons or...?
301239,L657064,u8923,m607,JIM,"Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance."
301240,L657063,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,It was in your book.
301241,L657058,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!"
301242,L657057,u8923,m607,JIM,There's only seventy-eight.
301243,L657056,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?"
301244,L657055,u8923,m607,JIM,"We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter."
301245,L657054,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
301246,L657053,u8923,m607,JIM,I know!  I know!
301247,L657052,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,What?  President Grant is...!
301248,L657051,u8923,m607,JIM,"Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque."
301249,L657002,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,My pleasure.
301250,L657001,u8923,m607,JIM,"Oh, thank you."
301251,L657000,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first."
301252,L656996,u8923,m607,JIM,"Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards..."
301253,L656995,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
301254,L656983,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty."
301255,L656982,u8923,m607,JIM,"When we find him, he is mine."
301256,L656980,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?"
301257,L656979,u8923,m607,JIM,"So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?"
301258,L656978,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,I adjusted it.
301259,L656977,u8923,m607,JIM,Not again.
301260,L656976,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear."
301261,L656975,u8923,m607,JIM,And people are actually fooled by that?
301262,L656974,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds."
301263,L656973,u8923,m607,JIM,What is that?
301264,L656971,u8923,m607,JIM,We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
301265,L656970,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Relax.  We're almost there.
301266,L656969,u8923,m607,JIM,"Damn, I wish this thing would go faster."
301267,L656968,u8923,m607,JIM,"That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?"
301268,L656967,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was ""damnably hot."""
301269,L656966,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,It's a town!
301270,L656965,u8923,m607,JIM,It's not a guy...
301271,L656964,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Willard...
301272,L656955,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
301273,L656954,u8923,m607,JIM,Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
301274,L656953,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,What's this?
301275,L656952,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
301276,L656951,u8923,m607,JIM,No record of him.
301277,L656950,u8923,m607,JIM,He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
301278,L656949,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,It is?
301279,L656948,u8923,m607,JIM,It's better than nothing.
301280,L656947,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Oh, damn!  That's it."
301281,L656945,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
301282,L656944,u8923,m607,JIM,This is good.
301283,L656938,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
301284,L656937,u8923,m607,JIM,Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
301285,L656936,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Know what this is?
301286,L656898,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
301287,L656897,u8923,m607,JIM,"Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton."
301288,L656896,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Thank you.
301289,L656895,u8923,m607,JIM,Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
301290,L656894,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Can you fill me in here?
301291,L656884,u8923,m607,JIM,"You really enjoy yourself, don't you?"
301292,L656883,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,They're so precious when they're asleep.
301293,L656881,u8923,m607,JIM,I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
301294,L656880,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
301295,L656879,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
301296,L656878,u8923,m607,JIM,You might have mentioned you had that.
301297,L656874,u8923,m607,JIM,"I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later."
301298,L656873,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Uh... how long ago was this?
301299,L656872,u8923,m607,JIM,"Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back."
301300,L656871,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,So... what happened?
301301,L656870,u8923,m607,JIM,Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
301302,L656869,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Well... that, too."
301303,L656868,u8923,m607,JIM,"""Spontaneous.""  I like that.  Most people say something like ""hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."""
301304,L656867,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
301305,L656866,u8923,m607,JIM,What way is that?
301306,L656865,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?"
301307,L656864,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works."
301308,L656863,u8923,m607,JIM,"No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want."
301309,L656862,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Jim, are you all right?"
301310,L656858,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,That's right... That's good.
301311,L656857,u8923,m607,JIM,"At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting."
301312,L656856,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Damn it, this is ridiculous."
301313,L656855,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Hey, I tried the board."
301314,L656854,u8923,m607,JIM,At least I tried something.
301315,L656850,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,It's a repeating steam cannon!
301316,L656849,u8923,m607,JIM,Never seen a gun fire so fast!
301317,L656848,u8923,m607,JIM,I'm going to hit you.
301318,L656847,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention."
301319,L656845,u8923,m607,JIM,And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
301320,L656844,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again."
301321,L656835,u8923,m607,JIM,"That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested."
301322,L656834,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,All that jumping and kicking.
301323,L656833,u8923,m607,JIM,All what?
301324,L656832,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,What was all that back there?
301325,L656811,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it."
301326,L656810,u8923,m607,JIM,"You're either having a seizure or you just said ""hello."""
301327,L656809,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Now, what was that?"
301328,L656808,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it."
301329,L656807,u8923,m607,JIM,You feeling all right?
301330,L656806,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Yes.  Now, observe...."
301331,L656805,u8923,m607,JIM,Almost?
301332,L656804,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
301333,L656800,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
301334,L656799,u8923,m607,JIM,"All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him..."
301335,L656798,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe."
301336,L656797,u8923,m607,JIM,"Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man."
301337,L656720,u8923,m607,JIM,Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
301338,L656719,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Quite.  Come, let's mingle."
301339,L656718,u8923,m607,JIM,That's a lot of butler.
301340,L656716,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet."
301341,L656715,u8923,m607,JIM,"Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong."
301342,L656714,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Come Llewellyn, don't tarry."
301343,L656712,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,My disguise.  And here...
301344,L656711,u8923,m607,JIM,Prepare what?
301345,L656710,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare."
301346,L656709,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
301347,L656708,u8923,m607,JIM,"Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party."
301348,L656707,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Limestone quarry?
301349,L656697,u8923,m607,JIM,What about the explosive?
301350,L656696,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but..."
301351,L656695,u8923,m607,JIM,Starting with a screw?
301352,L656694,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
301353,L656693,u8923,m607,JIM,Is this leading somewhere?
301354,L656692,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Yes, aha.  A brass screw."
301355,L656691,u8923,m607,JIM,Aha?
301356,L656690,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Aha!
301357,L656667,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,I'll work on it.
301358,L656666,u8923,m607,JIM,That should put us ahead of the criminals.
301359,L656663,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
301360,L656662,u8923,m607,JIM,Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
301361,L656661,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Try what?
301362,L656660,u8923,m607,JIM,"All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that."
301363,L656659,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!"
301364,L656658,u8923,m607,JIM,"No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this."
301365,L656657,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Always hoping.  Or this...
301366,L656656,u8923,m607,JIM,You need that real often?
301367,L656655,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas."
301368,L656653,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"""Gadget guy?""  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science."
301369,L656652,u8923,m607,JIM,Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
301370,L656651,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
301371,L656650,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"""Ay, there's the rub.""  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy."
301372,L656649,u8923,m607,JIM,Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
301373,L656648,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
301374,L656647,u8923,m607,JIM,Put them all together and what do we have?
301375,L656646,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics..."
301376,L656645,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Wouldn't dream of it.
301377,L656644,u8923,m607,JIM,But don't pull that again.
301378,L656632,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco."
301379,L656631,u8923,m607,JIM,"You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment."
301380,L656630,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors."
301381,L656629,u8923,m607,JIM,"Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?"
301382,L656628,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk..."
301383,L656627,u8923,m607,JIM,"Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime."
301384,L656626,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark."
301385,L656625,u8923,m607,JIM,Funny.  So am I.
301386,L656624,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
301387,L656623,u8923,m607,JIM,"I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?"
301388,L656622,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer."
301389,L656621,u8923,m607,JIM,Jim West.
301390,L656620,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,J. S. Bach.
301391,L657107,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
301392,L657106,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Time for you to get off, Ma'am."
301393,L657088,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid..."
301394,L657087,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,He's not giving up?
301395,L657080,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,But it only has six legs.
301396,L657079,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,He calls it the Tarantula.
301397,L657060,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,"My Lord, he was telling the truth!"
301398,L657059,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,You didn't tell us you had this on!
301399,L656824,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
301400,L656823,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,"Yes, me!"
301401,L656822,u8919,m607,ARTEMUS,"Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim..."
301402,L657095,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs."
301403,L657094,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,They don't even realize they should be frightened.
301404,L657093,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"I could get used to this, looking down on people."
301405,L656762,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
301406,L656761,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
301407,L656760,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Anyone?
301408,L656749,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,We'll see.
301409,L656748,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,A new friend?
301410,L657128,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"Fine, I'll stop."
301411,L657127,u8923,m607,JIM,"You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me."
301412,L656910,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case."
301413,L656909,u8923,m607,JIM,You bring the best out in a man.
301414,L656908,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,My.  It's gotten longer.
301415,L656905,u8923,m607,JIM,Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
301416,L656904,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,She's perfectly safe.
301417,L656789,u8923,m607,JIM,I've had some practice.
301418,L656788,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,You've... done... this... before.
301419,L656787,u8923,m607,JIM,"Oh, I would hope not."
301420,L656786,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,Would that include me?
301421,L656785,u8923,m607,JIM,Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
301422,L656782,u8923,m607,JIM,"I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too."
301423,L656781,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?"
301424,L656780,u8923,m607,JIM,"Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type."
301425,L656779,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
301426,L656778,u8923,m607,JIM,You tell me.
301427,L656777,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?"
301428,L656774,u8923,m607,JIM,"I don't like to lose, either."
301429,L656773,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
301430,L656743,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,You most certainly do.
301431,L656742,u8923,m607,JIM,"Well, I owe you one, don't I?"
301432,L656741,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list."
301433,L656740,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know."
301434,L656739,u8923,m607,JIM,"Your guests, ma'am?"
301435,L656738,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests."
301436,L656735,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,My... the wild west.
301437,L656734,u8923,m607,JIM,"Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas."
301438,L656733,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,Really?
301439,L656732,u8923,m607,JIM,Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
301440,L656731,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
301441,L656730,u8923,m607,JIM,"You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle."
301442,L656729,u8920,m607,CASSANDRA,"I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening."
301443,L656728,u8923,m607,JIM,"My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am."
301444,L657105,u8923,m607,JIM,"I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?"
301445,L657104,u8921,m607,DOYLE,"Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?"
301446,L656618,u8923,m607,JIM,My friend?
301447,L656617,u8921,m607,DOYLE,"Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard."
301448,L656616,u8921,m607,DOYLE,"That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well."
301449,L656615,u8923,m607,JIM,Private train?
301450,L656614,u8921,m607,DOYLE,"Your private train, sir."
301451,L656613,u8921,m607,DOYLE,"Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here."
301452,L656612,u8923,m607,JIM,"Look, I'm Captain James West..."
301453,L656594,u8922,m607,GRANT,A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
301454,L656593,u8926,m607,RICHARDS,"Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean..."
301455,L656584,u8922,m607,GRANT,"French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!"
301456,L656583,u8926,m607,RICHARDS,Yes sir.
301457,L656582,u8922,m607,GRANT,French?
301458,L656581,u8926,m607,RICHARDS,"Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French..."
301459,L656580,u8922,m607,GRANT,"Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence."
301460,L656579,u8926,m607,RICHARDS,"Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case..."
301461,L656578,u8922,m607,GRANT,"Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?"
301462,L656963,u8922,m607,GRANT,He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
301463,L656962,u8923,m607,JIM,Where'd he say he was going to do this?
301464,L656958,u8922,m607,GRANT,On my way to Denver...
301465,L656957,u8923,m607,JIM,"... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?"
301466,L656607,u8922,m607,GRANT,And now the job's yours.
301467,L656606,u8923,m607,JIM,And?
301468,L656605,u8922,m607,GRANT,"Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues..."
301469,L656604,u8922,m607,GRANT,Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
301470,L656603,u8923,m607,JIM,"Nicely said, sir."
301471,L656602,u8922,m607,GRANT,We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
301472,L656601,u8922,m607,GRANT,Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
301473,L656600,u8923,m607,JIM,But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
301474,L656592,u8923,m607,JIM,"Nice to finally meet you, sir."
301475,L656591,u8922,m607,GRANT,This is Colonel Richards.
301476,L656590,u8923,m607,JIM,Good work.  Really.
301477,L656589,u8922,m607,GRANT,"That'll be all, boys."
301478,L656588,u8923,m607,JIM,"Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that."
301479,L657140,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
301480,L657139,u8923,m607,JIM,Easy now.
301481,L657027,u8923,m607,JIM,"So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?"
301482,L657026,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!"
301483,L657025,u8923,m607,JIM,"Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?"
301484,L657024,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,The first.
301485,L657023,u8923,m607,JIM,"""Emperor Miguelito...?"""
301486,L657022,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,I've even printed my own currency.
301487,L657019,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!"
301488,L657018,u8923,m607,JIM,That would be... the Mexican War?
301489,L657017,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
301490,L657016,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
301491,L657015,u8923,m607,JIM,The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
301492,L657013,u8923,m607,JIM,Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
301493,L657012,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
301494,L657011,u8923,m607,JIM,You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
301495,L657010,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Philistine.
301496,L657009,u8923,m607,JIM,He had a pressing engagement.
301497,L657008,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
301498,L657006,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant."
301499,L657005,u8923,m607,JIM,You're not that big.
301500,L656940,u8923,m607,JIM,Dr. Loveless?
301501,L656939,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!"
301502,L656927,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
301503,L656926,u8923,m607,JIM,"Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk."
301504,L656769,u8923,m607,JIM,How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
301505,L656768,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
301506,L656766,u8923,m607,JIM,I deal with some tough customers.
301507,L656765,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
301508,L656764,u8923,m607,JIM,"No, sir... just a businessman."
301509,L656763,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade."
301510,L656757,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
301511,L656756,u8923,m607,JIM,I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
301512,L656754,u8924,m607,MIGUELITO,"When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?"
301513,L656753,u8923,m607,JIM,I admire a man with a sense of humor.
301514,L657076,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
301515,L657075,u8923,m607,JIM,I beg your pardon?
301516,L657042,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,It is?
301517,L657041,u8923,m607,JIM,Now it's a bomb.
301518,L657040,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,It's a smelting retort.
301519,L657039,u8923,m607,JIM,This is something.
301520,L657038,u8923,m607,JIM,He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
301521,L657037,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,"He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?"
301522,L657034,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
301523,L657033,u8923,m607,JIM,Are you all right?
301524,L656843,u8923,m607,JIM,"A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch."
301525,L656842,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,"A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye."
301526,L656841,u8923,m607,JIM,Who was this partner of his?
301527,L656840,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,"I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the ""rare and unparalleled opportunity"" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do."
301528,L656831,u8923,m607,JIM,We'll explain on the way.
301529,L656830,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,Who were they?  What do they want with me?
301530,L656829,u8923,m607,JIM,Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
301531,L656819,u8925,m607,PEMBERTON,Yes!
301532,L656818,u8923,m607,JIM,Dr. Pemberton?
301533,L656549,u8923,m607,JIM,Right.
301534,L656548,u8927,m607,WALTERS,"Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men..."
301535,L656547,u8923,m607,JIM,"You're not going to use it, are you?"
301536,L656546,u8927,m607,WALTERS,Hey...!
301537,L656545,u8923,m607,JIM,In an hour they're gone!
301538,L656544,u8927,m607,WALTERS,They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
301539,L656543,u8923,m607,JIM,When are they coming?
301540,L656542,u8927,m607,WALTERS,They're coming.
301541,L656541,u8923,m607,JIM,Well?
301542,L657837,u8928,m608,AIRK,Let's go.
301543,L657836,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Thank you, friend."
301544,L657835,u8928,m608,AIRK,"Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!"
301545,L657834,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?"
301546,L657782,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Just get me some horses.
301547,L657781,u8928,m608,AIRK,You're chasing a dream.
301548,L657779,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Then come with us.
301549,L657778,u8928,m608,AIRK,"You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?"
301550,L657769,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,They're not after me.  They want the baby.
301551,L657768,u8928,m608,AIRK,"It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?"
301552,L657763,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Is this what's left of your army?
301553,L657762,u8928,m608,AIRK,You managed alright.
301554,L657761,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"You left me to die, friend."
301555,L657369,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you."
301556,L657368,u8928,m608,AIRK,"Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!"
301557,L657367,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here."
301558,L657365,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
301559,L657364,u8928,m608,AIRK,I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
301560,L657363,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
301561,L657362,u8928,m608,AIRK,Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
301562,L657361,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"He thought you were a woman, Airk!"
301563,L657360,u8928,m608,AIRK,"We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it."
301564,L657457,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
301565,L657456,u8937,m608,WILLOW,They look like acorns.
301566,L657454,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
301567,L657453,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
301568,L657452,u8937,m608,WILLOW,No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
301569,L657451,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,"You are very important, Willow."
301570,L657450,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
301571,L657449,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,"The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel."
301572,L657446,u8937,m608,WILLOW,What is Tir Asleen?
301573,L657445,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,"You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen."
301574,L657444,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Me?
301575,L657443,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,"No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life."
301576,L657441,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
301577,L657440,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?"
301578,L657434,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,"I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom..."
301579,L657433,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Yes...?
301580,L657432,u8929,m608,CHERLINDREA,Willow Ufgood.
301581,L657291,u8930,m608,HIGH ALDWIN,"Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow..."
301582,L657290,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!"
301583,L657289,u8930,m608,HIGH ALDWIN,Go in the direction the bird is flying.
301584,L657288,u8930,m608,HIGH ALDWIN,"Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition."
301585,L657287,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!"
301586,L657286,u8930,m608,HIGH ALDWIN,"You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow."
301587,L657285,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?"
301588,L657284,u8930,m608,HIGH ALDWIN,"Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can."
301589,L657256,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin."
301590,L657255,u8930,m608,HIGH ALDWIN,"Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow."
301591,L657238,u8937,m608,WILLOW,It's a matter of great importance to me!
301592,L657237,u8930,m608,HIGH ALDWIN,"Not today, Willow."
301593,L657236,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Sir!  I have to talk to you.
301594,L657890,u8935,m608,SORSHA,I have no family.
301595,L657889,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"We'll probably die here, Sorsha."
301596,L657824,u8935,m608,SORSHA,Madmartigan.
301597,L657823,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Sorsha.
301598,L657743,u8935,m608,SORSHA,I don't believe you.
301599,L657742,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Because it's true.
301600,L657741,u8935,m608,SORSHA,I love you.
301601,L657740,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Say what?
301602,L657739,u8935,m608,SORSHA,Why did you say that?
301603,L657736,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I'm not going to let this baby die.
301604,L657735,u8935,m608,SORSHA,You're a fool.  Now put her back.
301605,L657704,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Too bad you're not more like your father.
301606,L657703,u8935,m608,SORSHA,I do what I'm told.
301607,L657633,u8935,m608,SORSHA,My step-father's going to tear you apart.
301608,L657632,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman."
301609,L657513,u8935,m608,SORSHA,You're not a woman.
301610,L657512,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Gawd...you're...beautiful...
301611,L657508,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Why not?
301612,L657507,u8935,m608,SORSHA,Why not?
301613,L657506,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I can't.
301614,L657504,u8935,m608,SORSHA,Let me see it.
301615,L657503,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I can't.
301616,L657501,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,No.  I mean yes.
301617,L657500,u8935,m608,SORSHA,You!  Are you the mother of that child?
301618,L657877,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?"
301619,L657876,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
301620,L657651,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"As above, so below."
301621,L657650,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,We're a tiny version of all that?
301622,L657636,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter."
301623,L657635,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Who is that girl, anyway?"
301624,L657621,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,I will!  But I need help!
301625,L657620,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Then you get us out of here.
301626,L657616,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,He turned that monster into stone!
301627,L657615,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,He's no magician.
301628,L657614,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?"
301629,L657887,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?"
301630,L657886,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"I don't know, Willow."
301631,L657882,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle..."
301632,L657881,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!"
301633,L657880,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
301634,L657796,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Ahhh!
301635,L657795,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Watch it!
301636,L657794,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--"
301637,L657793,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"She's a bird, Willow."
301638,L657792,u8937,m608,WILLOW,She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
301639,L657791,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
301640,L657789,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
301641,L657788,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Want me to carry Elora?
301642,L657787,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
301643,L657696,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?"
301644,L657695,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You?
301645,L657685,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
301646,L657684,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,She's in love.
301647,L657682,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Well what did she say?
301648,L657681,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"She asked about you, Madmartigan."
301649,L657680,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Willow!
301650,L657679,u8937,m608,WILLOW,She said lots of thing.s
301651,L657678,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?"
301652,L657677,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Who?
301653,L657676,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Did she ask about me?
301654,L657649,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan."
301655,L657648,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
301656,L657623,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I won't.
301657,L657622,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I'll help you...!
301658,L657550,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
301659,L657549,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You?
301660,L657548,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!"
301661,L657542,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
301662,L657541,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"Madmartigan, I need your help."
301663,L657539,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
301664,L657538,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
301665,L657537,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist."
301666,L657531,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I did?
301667,L657530,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
301668,L657529,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!"
301669,L657528,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Elora Danan!
301670,L657527,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!"
301671,L657525,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I thought you had her!
301672,L657524,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Where's the baby??
301673,L657510,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Because she's sick.
301674,L657509,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Because she's sick.
301675,L657499,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Time to leave.
301676,L657498,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Time to change her diaper.
301677,L657495,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Nursemaid?!
301678,L657494,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
301679,L657493,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Hey!  Give me that baby!
301680,L657486,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Where the hell did you come from?
301681,L657485,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You!!
301682,L657388,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake."
301683,L657387,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
301684,L657385,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Of course!  I promise!
301685,L657384,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed."
301686,L657383,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Absolutely!
301687,L657382,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Fresh goat's milk.
301688,L657381,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,I will.
301689,L657380,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You gotta promise to feed her.
301690,L657377,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You don't know anything about ba- bies.
301691,L657376,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
301692,L657375,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I hate this.
301693,L657374,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?"
301694,L657372,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Friend of yours?
301695,L657371,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!"
301696,L657354,u8937,m608,WILLOW,What is it?
301697,L657353,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,You hear trouble.
301698,L657352,u8937,m608,WILLOW,What's that?  I hear something!
301699,L657351,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
301700,L657350,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Are you a warrior?
301701,L657349,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Smells like a battle.
301702,L657343,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
301703,L657342,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You all right?
301704,L657335,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world."
301705,L657334,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Farmer.
301706,L657333,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,You a woodcutter?
301707,L657329,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I don't know.
301708,L657328,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!"
301709,L657327,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Are you okay?
301710,L657326,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Thanks for your help, Peck."
301711,L657320,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
301712,L657319,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Hey!  Somebody's coming!
301713,L657316,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I have to give this baby to some- body.
301714,L657315,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Why.
301715,L657314,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
301716,L657312,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Miserable Pecks.
301717,L657311,u8937,m608,WILLOW,You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
301718,L657310,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,"Don't make me angry, Peck."
301719,L657309,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Good.  How long will it take?
301720,L657308,u8931,m608,MADMARTIGAN,Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
301721,L657283,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep..."
301722,L657282,u8932,m608,RANON,I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
301723,L657281,u8932,m608,RANON,Are you scared?
301724,L657280,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
301725,L657279,u8932,m608,RANON,"Dada, what's a daikini?"
301726,L657207,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Absolutely not.
301727,L657206,u8932,m608,RANON,"Can't we keep it, Dada?"
301728,L657203,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini..."
301729,L657202,u8932,m608,RANON,It's not a Nelwyn baby.
301730,L657900,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"Courage, Willow."
301731,L657899,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"Patience, Willow."
301732,L657896,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Surrender!!
301733,L657895,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Time is running out.
301734,L657865,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"She's too powerful, Raziel"
301735,L657864,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
301736,L657863,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
301737,L657853,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Just do it!
301738,L657852,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Why?
301739,L657851,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
301740,L657816,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me."
301741,L657815,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
301742,L657812,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,More!  More!
301743,L657811,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
301744,L657809,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
301745,L657808,u8937,m608,WILLOW,How??
301746,L657805,u8937,m608,WILLOW,There's nobody here.
301747,L657804,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Tir Asleen.
301748,L657722,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow."
301749,L657721,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I just wanted to test it first.
301750,L657720,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Now use it.
301751,L657719,u8937,m608,WILLOW,His will.
301752,L657718,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
301753,L657716,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
301754,L657715,u8937,m608,WILLOW,What'd you bit me for!!
301755,L657714,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Shhhhh!
301756,L657713,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Ouch!!
301757,L657712,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
301758,L657711,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"Oooh, this smells terrible."
301759,L657694,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Me!
301760,L657693,u8937,m608,WILLOW,But what am I gonna transform??
301761,L657692,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,The art of transformation!
301762,L657691,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
301763,L657690,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
301764,L657689,u8937,m608,WILLOW,The limitless power of...
301765,L657688,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,What's the magician's weapon?
301766,L657687,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
301767,L657686,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
301768,L657655,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
301769,L657654,u8937,m608,WILLOW,How am I gonna do that?
301770,L657653,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Burn it to a fine ash.
301771,L657652,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I'm all finished.  Now what?
301772,L657647,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand."
301773,L657646,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?"
301774,L657645,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
301775,L657644,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
301776,L657640,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair."
301777,L657639,u8937,m608,WILLOW,What do I need for that?
301778,L657638,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,"Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!"
301779,L657626,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Then I will teach you.
301780,L657625,u8937,m608,WILLOW,That's all I ever wanted!
301781,L657624,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,You must learn magic.
301782,L657619,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
301783,L657618,u8937,m608,WILLOW,No.
301784,L657617,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Did *you* give that acorn its power?
301785,L657597,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Kill him!
301786,L657596,u8937,m608,WILLOW,No!
301787,L657595,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Kill him!
301788,L657586,u8937,m608,WILLOW,We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
301789,L657585,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,What do you want!
301790,L657581,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
301791,L657580,u8933,m608,RAZIEL,Who are you!  Who are you!
301792,L657612,u8934,m608,ROOL,Ouch!  Let go of me!
301793,L657611,u8936,m608,TEEMO,"Get back here, Rool!"
301794,L657610,u8934,m608,ROOL,"Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home."
301795,L657609,u8936,m608,TEEMO,We gotta follow them.
301796,L657556,u8934,m608,ROOL,Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
301797,L657555,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Are you sure?
301798,L657474,u8934,m608,ROOL,Me neither!
301799,L657473,u8936,m608,TEEMO,I'm not going in there.
301800,L657417,u8934,m608,ROOL,He never misses.
301801,L657416,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
301802,L657411,u8934,m608,ROOL,Somebody has to do it.
301803,L657410,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
301804,L657670,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Here.  Hold her.
301805,L657669,u8935,m608,SORSHA,I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
301806,L657668,u8937,m608,WILLOW,She's hungry.
301807,L657665,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I don't know much about him.
301808,L657664,u8935,m608,SORSHA,Who is he?
301809,L657663,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Madmartigan.
301810,L657662,u8935,m608,SORSHA,Who is that horrible friend of yours?
301811,L657661,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire."
301812,L657660,u8935,m608,SORSHA,I changed her already!
301813,L657659,u8937,m608,WILLOW,She needs to be changed.
301814,L657631,u8935,m608,SORSHA,Shut up.
301815,L657630,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying."
301816,L657584,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
301817,L657583,u8937,m608,WILLOW,This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
301818,L657576,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
301819,L657575,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Obviously.
301820,L657568,u8936,m608,TEEMO,The sorceress.
301821,L657567,u8937,m608,WILLOW,We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
301822,L657560,u8937,m608,WILLOW,How are we going to get out there?
301823,L657559,u8936,m608,TEEMO,"Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold."
301824,L657468,u8937,m608,WILLOW,How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
301825,L657467,u8936,m608,TEEMO,"Hey, careful there!"
301826,L657436,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I can't see anything--she's too bright!
301827,L657435,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Talk!  Say something!
301828,L657429,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
301829,L657428,u8937,m608,WILLOW,This is not going well.
301830,L657424,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Why not?
301831,L657423,u8936,m608,TEEMO,Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
301832,L657422,u8937,m608,WILLOW,"Ohhh, I hate this."
301833,L657415,u8936,m608,TEEMO,"No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!"
301834,L657414,u8937,m608,WILLOW,I'm getting her out of there!
301835,L657408,u8936,m608,TEEMO,"You're the guardian, aren't you?"
301836,L657407,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Who??
301837,L657406,u8936,m608,TEEMO,She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
301838,L657405,u8937,m608,WILLOW,Queen Cherlindrea?
301839,L657404,u8936,m608,TEEMO,"We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm."
301840,L659186,u8941,m609,ELI,Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
301841,L659185,u8938,m609,BOOK,Guess I'm not used to so much.
301842,L659184,u8941,m609,ELI,"Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?"
301843,L659160,u8938,m609,BOOK,Not one this big.
301844,L659159,u8941,m609,ELI,"Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?"
301845,L659156,u8941,m609,ELI,"Good, you start tomorrow."
301846,L659155,u8938,m609,BOOK,I've seen pictures.
301847,L659154,u8941,m609,ELI,"Cows. You know, cows?"
301848,L659153,u8938,m609,BOOK,Milking?
301849,L659152,u8941,m609,ELI,Maybe milking.
301850,L659151,u8938,m609,BOOK,"Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?"
301851,L658988,u8938,m609,BOOK,Just do it!
301852,L658987,u8940,m609,ELAINE,"John, why?..."
301853,L658986,u8938,m609,BOOK,You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
301854,L658985,u8940,m609,ELAINE,"John, I don't understand any of this."
301855,L658984,u8938,m609,BOOK,Put my car in the garage and close the door.
301856,L658882,u8938,m609,BOOK,They're Amish.

301863,L658875,u8938,m609,BOOK,Sorry. It's important.
301864,L658874,u8940,m609,ELAINE,How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
301865,L659279,u8938,m609,BOOK,Pick up the hat.

301870,L659236,u8942,m609,HOCHSTETLER,"Your hole is healed, then?"
301871,L659234,u8942,m609,HOCHSTETLER,No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
301872,L659233,u8938,m609,BOOK,It's been a while.
301873,L659232,u8942,m609,HOCHSTETLER,"Eli says you're a carpenter, Book."
301874,L659169,u8938,m609,BOOK,Try the house.

301897,L659087,u8938,m609,BOOK,Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.

301914,L659269,u8938,m609,BOOK,I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.

301919,L658963,u8938,m609,BOOK,A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
301920,L658962,u8947,m609,SCHAEFFER,What's your first move?
301921,L658961,u8947,m609,SCHAEFFER,"Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you."
301922,L658960,u8938,m609,BOOK,More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.

He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum."
301927,L658955,u8947,m609,SCHAEFFER,I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
301928,L658954,u8938,m609,BOOK,Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.

301933,L658845,u8938,m609,BOOK,"The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing."
301934,L658844,u8947,m609,SCHAEFFER,That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
301935,L658843,u8938,m609,BOOK,If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
301936,L658842,u8947,m609,SCHAEFFER,You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
301937,L658841,u8938,m609,BOOK,Maybe.
301938,L658840,u8947,m609,SCHAEFFER,You know who?
301939,L658839,u8938,m609,BOOK,Maybe.

302126,L658900,u8945,m609,RACHEL,I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
302127,L658899,u8940,m609,ELAINE,You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
302128,L658898,u8945,m609,RACHEL,Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
302129,L658897,u8940,m609,ELAINE,"Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John."

302131,L658895,u8940,m609,ELAINE,You didn't have to...
302132,L658894,u8945,m609,RACHEL,Good morning.

302135,L658885,u8940,m609,ELAINE,John said you're Amish.
302136,L658884,u8945,m609,RACHEL,"Yes, thank you very much."

302139,L659352,u8941,m609,ELI,"No, Rachel..."
302140,L659212,u8945,m609,RACHEL,You shame yourself.
302141,L659211,u8941,m609,ELI,No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
302142,L659210,u8945,m609,RACHEL,I will be the judge of that.
302143,L659209,u8941,m609,ELI,You are acting like one!
302144,L659208,u8945,m609,RACHEL,I am not a child.
302145,L659207,u8941,m609,ELI,"Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!"
302146,L659206,u8945,m609,RACHEL,That is idle talk.
302147,L659205,u8941,m609,ELI,"No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!"
302148,L659204,u8945,m609,RACHEL,I have committed no sin.
302149,L659203,u8941,m609,ELI,"Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?"
302150,L659202,u8945,m609,RACHEL,I have done nothing against the ordnung.
302151,L659201,u8941,m609,ELI,How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
302152,L659188,u8941,m609,ELI,"Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter."
302153,L659187,u8945,m609,RACHEL,"Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman."
302154,L659026,u8945,m609,RACHEL,"I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel."
302155,L659025,u8941,m609,ELI,"Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands."
302156,L659024,u8945,m609,RACHEL,"We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!"
302157,L659023,u8941,m609,ELI,Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws
302158,L659015,u8945,m609,RACHEL,I know.
302159,L659014,u8941,m609,ELI,That has no place in this house.

302164,L659001,u8941,m609,ELI,Who was that man?

302166,L659284,u8943,m609,LOCAL MAN,"You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?"
302167,L659283,u8945,m609,RACHEL,"John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant."
302168,L659282,u8943,m609,LOCAL MAN,"We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them."
302169,L659281,u8945,m609,RACHEL,He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
302170,L659280,u8943,m609,LOCAL MAN,Never seen anything like that in all my years.

302187,L659324,u8947,m609,SCHAEFFER,"Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?"

302220,L659375,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Aunt Em!
302221,L659465,u8948,m610,AUNT EM,"Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go."
302222,L659464,u8962,m610,UNCLE HENRY,Uhh -- yeah --

302265,L660427,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!"
302266,L660426,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Ohhh!
302267,L660425,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!"
302268,L660361,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh ....
302269,L660360,u8964,m610,WIZARD,Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
302270,L660357,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me."
302271,L660356,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I don't believe you!
302272,L660355,u8964,m610,WIZARD,Uhhhh -- yes...
302273,L659423,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --"
302274,L659422,u8952,m610,HICKORY,"Are you all right, Dorothy?"
302275,L659421,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!"
302276,L659415,u8952,m610,HICKORY,Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
302277,L659414,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Hickory!
302278,L659413,u8952,m610,HICKORY,Who did it? Now wait a minute.
302279,L659412,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh!
302280,L659411,u8952,m610,HICKORY,"Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!"
302281,L659410,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,This?
302282,L659409,u8952,m610,HICKORY,"Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented."
302283,L659408,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Well, gee, I try and have a heart."
302284,L659407,u8952,m610,HICKORY,"Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her."
302285,L660212,u8963,m610,WITCH,"Catch him, you fool!"
302286,L660211,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Run, Toto, run!"
302287,L660208,u8963,m610,WITCH,"No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as..."
302288,L660207,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
302289,L660206,u8963,m610,WITCH,Ahh!  Ah!
302290,L660205,u8963,m610,WITCH,That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
302291,L660204,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
302292,L660203,u8963,m610,WITCH,Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
302293,L660202,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
302294,L660201,u8963,m610,WITCH,Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
302295,L660200,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, please give me back my dog!"
302296,L660199,u8963,m610,WITCH,"All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time."
302297,L660198,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
302298,L659620,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
302299,L659619,u8963,m610,WITCH,...didn't you?
302300,L660472,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
302301,L660471,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."""
302302,L660470,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times."
302303,L660469,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Yes, I'm ready now."
302304,L660468,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto."
302305,L660467,u8951,m610,GLINDA,Are you ready now?
302306,L660462,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye."
302307,L660461,u8951,m610,GLINDA,Whenever you wish.
302308,L660460,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, now?"
302309,L660459,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Toto, too."
302310,L660458,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"...Toto, too?"
302311,L660448,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I have?
302312,L660447,u8951,m610,GLINDA,You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
302313,L660446,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?"
302314,L659644,u8951,m610,GLINDA,It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
302315,L659643,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"But, how do I start for Emerald City?"
302316,L659642,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West."
302317,L659641,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"No, I'm afraid I didn't."
302318,L659640,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?"
302319,L659639,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
302320,L659638,u8951,m610,GLINDA,No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
302321,L659637,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came."
302322,L659636,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear."
302323,L659615,u8951,m610,GLINDA,That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
302324,L659614,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I thought you said she was dead.
302325,L659565,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out."
302326,L659564,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?"
302327,L659563,u8951,m610,GLINDA,The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
302328,L659557,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all..."
302329,L659556,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Toto's my dog.
302330,L659554,u8951,m610,GLINDA,Oh!  Well....
302331,L659553,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas."
302332,L659552,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?"
302333,L660489,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"But you couldn't have been, could you?"
302334,L660488,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Oh --
302335,L659533,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right...."
302336,L659532,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
302337,L659531,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!"
302338,L659530,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, you...."
302339,L659529,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
302340,L659528,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, no -- no!"
302341,L659527,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,...bed.
302342,L659526,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the...."
302343,L659525,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,...paper?
302344,L659524,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Has it poppies on the wall....
302345,L659523,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,...room --
302346,L659521,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,What's she doing now?
302347,L659520,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Uh-huh.
302348,L659519,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
302349,L659517,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Me?
302350,L659516,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
302351,L659515,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302352,L659514,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying."
302353,L659513,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,That's right.  What's she doing?
302354,L659512,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Her -- her name is Emily.
302355,L659511,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Yes...That's Aunt Em.
302356,L659510,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,...her face is careworn.
302357,L659507,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Oh -- yes.
302358,L659506,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,That's our farm!
302359,L659499,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's...."
302360,L659498,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?"
302361,L659497,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Oh --
302362,L659496,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"No, they won't - honestly."
302363,L659495,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"Aw, come, come, come --"
302364,L659494,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
302365,L659493,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Oh --
302366,L659492,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you."
302367,L659491,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?"
302368,L659488,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?"
302369,L659487,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,Yes --
302370,L659486,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me."
302371,L659485,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --"
302372,L659484,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Why --
302373,L659483,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?"
302374,L659482,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,How did you guess?
302375,L659481,u8958,m610,PROFESSOR,"Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away."
302376,L659473,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Stop her!
302377,L659472,u8956,m610,MISS GULCH,Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
302378,L659469,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!"
302379,L659468,u8956,m610,MISS GULCH,Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
302380,L659467,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,No --
302381,L659466,u8956,m610,MISS GULCH,Now you're seeing reason.
302382,L659458,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?"
302383,L659457,u8956,m610,MISS GULCH,That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
302384,L660464,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage."
302385,L660463,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
302386,L660405,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Look -- it ticks!
302387,L660404,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,...yes.
302388,L660403,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Yes...!
302389,L660402,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!"
302390,L660337,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,You've had plenty of time already!
302391,L660336,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now."
302392,L660279,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I knew you would!
302393,L660278,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Dorothy!
302394,L660156,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Now come on - you're acting silly --
302395,L660155,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh! Something bit me, too!"
302396,L660147,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!"
302397,L660146,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,No.  Why only --  Oh --
302398,L660070,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
302399,L660069,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"Oh, he's just ascared again."
302400,L659992,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302401,L659991,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Can't that female take no for an answer?
302402,L659881,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I'm sure he could give you some courage.
302403,L659880,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,And him a brain.
302404,L659853,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
302405,L659852,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,What sort of an animal is that?
302406,L659851,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,And bears!
302407,L659835,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302408,L659834,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,We might.
302409,L659825,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?"
302410,L659824,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
302411,L659811,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh-oh-
302412,L659810,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!"
302413,L659809,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302414,L659808,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh! Oh!
302415,L659807,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Oh - I'll get it!
302416,L659806,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!"
302417,L659805,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers."
302418,L659804,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?"
302419,L659803,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Oh! They're - they're gone now.
302420,L659793,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
302421,L659792,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already."
302422,L659791,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?"
302423,L659788,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way."
302424,L659787,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart."
302425,L659786,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
302426,L659785,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?"
302427,L659778,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,All hollow.  Oh --
302428,L659777,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302429,L659772,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --!
302430,L659771,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
302431,L659770,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Well, you're perfect now."
302432,L659769,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since."
302433,L659768,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain...."
302434,L659767,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?"
302435,L659766,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
302436,L659765,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"...Oh, did that hurt?"
302437,L659764,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Oh --
302438,L659763,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh...
302439,L659762,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows."
302440,L659756,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,My mouth -- my mouth!
302441,L659755,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Where do you want to be oiled first?
302442,L659752,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Oil can....
302443,L659751,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Did you say something?
302444,L659750,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,Oil can.....Oil can....
302445,L659850,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, my!"
302446,L659849,u8961,m610,TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY,Lions and tigers and bears!
302447,L659848,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, my!"
302448,L659847,u8961,m610,TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY,Lions and tigers and bears!
302449,L659846,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, my!"
302450,L659845,u8961,m610,TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY,Lions and tigers and bears!
302451,L659844,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, my!"
302452,L659843,u8961,m610,TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY,Lions and tigers and bears!
302453,L659842,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, my!"
302454,L660466,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I think I'll miss you most of all.
302455,L660465,u8954,m610,LION,Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
302456,L660444,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?"
302457,L660443,u8954,m610,LION,"Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go."
302458,L660442,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, now I'll never get home!"
302459,L660409,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
302460,L660408,u8954,m610,LION,...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
302461,L660293,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Ohhh!
302462,L660292,u8954,m610,LION,They're coming back!
302463,L660277,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!"
302464,L660276,u8954,m610,LION,Did they hurtcha?
302465,L660275,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
302466,L660166,u8954,m610,LION,I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
302467,L660165,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
302468,L660164,u8954,m610,LION,As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
302469,L660160,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
302470,L660159,u8954,m610,LION,That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
302471,L660138,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302472,L660137,u8954,m610,LION,"No, but it's wonderful for threatening with."
302473,L660136,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Does it work?
302474,L660121,u8954,m610,LION,Huh?  What'd he say?
302475,L660120,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh -- Oh, come on."
302476,L660077,u8954,m610,LION,Ohh!
302477,L660076,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, come on."
302478,L660075,u8954,m610,LION,Because I'm still scared!
302479,L660074,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,But why?  Why?
302480,L660073,u8954,m610,LION,I'd sooner wait outside.
302481,L660072,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you."
302482,L660071,u8954,m610,LION,I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
302483,L660043,u8954,m610,LION,I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
302484,L660042,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Supposin' you met an elephant?
302485,L660041,u8954,m610,LION,"Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!"
302486,L660040,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,How about a hippopotamus?
302487,L660037,u8954,m610,LION,"Not nobody, not nohow!"
302488,L660036,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?"
302489,L660023,u8954,m610,LION,"In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If...."
302490,L660022,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I'll be home in time for supper!
302491,L660010,u8954,m610,LION,And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
302492,L660009,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, but -- but please. It's very important."
302493,L659990,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
302494,L659989,u8954,m610,LION,Who's her?  Who's her?
302495,L659986,u8954,m610,LION,Hah!
302496,L659985,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
302497,L659939,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!"
302498,L659938,u8954,m610,LION,"Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?"
302499,L659904,u8954,m610,LION,Yes.
302500,L659903,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Yes -- let's run!
302501,L659901,u8954,m610,LION,"Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?"
302502,L659900,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!"
302503,L659894,u8954,m610,LION,The nerve.
302504,L659893,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,A home --
302505,L659887,u8954,m610,LION,"Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --"
302506,L659886,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh.
302507,L659885,u8954,m610,LION,...has been simply unbearable.
302508,L659873,u8954,m610,LION,You're right -- I am a coward.
302509,L659872,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!"
302510,L659871,u8954,m610,LION,"Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?"
302511,L659870,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --"
302512,L659869,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"No, but you tried to."
302513,L659868,u8954,m610,LION,What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
302514,L659425,u8953,m610,HUNK,What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
302515,L659424,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!"
302516,L659406,u8953,m610,HUNK,"Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know."
302517,L659405,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all."
302518,L659404,u8953,m610,HUNK,"Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?"
302519,L659403,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I have so got brains.
302520,L659402,u8953,m610,HUNK,"Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all."
302521,L660304,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
302522,L660303,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
302523,L660302,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,No -- No -- No -- No!
302524,L660158,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Did you just hear what I just heard?
302525,L660157,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Oh, come on now - everybody --"
302526,L660149,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
302527,L660148,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh -- Oh --
302528,L660058,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
302529,L660057,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
302530,L660056,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302531,L659999,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!"
302532,L659998,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Dear, whatever shall we do?"
302533,L659943,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --"
302534,L659942,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
302535,L659941,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
302536,L659940,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Yes -- there --
302537,L659937,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302538,L659936,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!"
302539,L659914,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!"
302540,L659913,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,...along.
302541,L659879,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
302542,L659878,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?"
302543,L659833,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
302544,L659832,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter."
302545,L659831,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
302546,L659823,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?"
302547,L659822,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?"
302548,L659819,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?"
302549,L659818,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
302550,L659790,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
302551,L659789,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
302552,L659760,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Yes --- there.
302553,L659759,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,The other side....
302554,L659758,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Here -- here --
302555,L659757,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,He said his mouth.
302556,L659754,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!"
302557,L659753,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Oil can what?
302558,L659749,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Yes.  Oh -- look --
302559,L659748,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,What?
302560,L659747,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!"
302561,L659746,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh --
302562,L659745,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
302563,L659735,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!"
302564,L659734,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas."
302565,L659726,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,To Oz!
302566,L659725,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,To Oz?
302567,L659724,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will."
302568,L659723,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
302569,L659722,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
302570,L659720,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?"
302571,L659719,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,I don't blame you for that.
302572,L659718,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
302573,L659717,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble."
302574,L659716,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Yes -- that's true.
302575,L659715,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now."
302576,L659714,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
302577,L659713,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Um-hmm.
302578,L659712,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,You're going to see a Wizard?
302579,L659711,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
302580,L659710,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Where's Kansas?
302581,L659709,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Um-hmm.
302582,L659708,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,They would?
302583,L659707,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!"
302584,L659695,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself."
302585,L659694,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Did I scare you?
302586,L659693,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
302587,L659692,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,...free!
302588,L659691,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"My, it's good to be...."
302589,L659690,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Ohhh --
302590,L659689,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again."
302591,L659688,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Oh -- does it hurt you?
302592,L659687,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
302593,L659686,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,Ohh!
302594,L659685,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Ohhhh --
302595,L659684,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,...yes.
302596,L659680,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind."
302597,L659679,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,"Oh, well, here -- let me help you."
302598,L659678,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --"
302599,L659661,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"It's pleasant down that way, too."
302600,L659660,u8950,m610,DOROTHY,...don't talk.
302601,L659632,u8963,m610,WITCH,"Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way...."
302602,L659631,u8951,m610,GLINDA,"Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too."
302603,L659630,u8963,m610,WITCH,"You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!"
302604,L659626,u8951,m610,GLINDA,It's too late!  There they....
302605,L659625,u8963,m610,WITCH,"The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---"
302606,L659623,u8963,m610,WITCH,The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
302607,L659622,u8951,m610,GLINDA,...ting the ruby slippers?
302608,L659618,u8963,m610,WITCH,"You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,...."
302609,L659617,u8951,m610,GLINDA,Leave her alone!
302610,L659616,u8963,m610,WITCH,Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
302611,L660422,u8954,m610,LION,It did?
302612,L660421,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair."
302613,L660415,u8964,m610,WIZARD,Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
302614,L660414,u8954,m610,LION,Dorothy next!
302615,L660413,u8964,m610,WIZARD,Ah --
302616,L660412,u8954,m610,LION,Yeah.
302617,L660384,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me."
302618,L660383,u8954,m610,LION,Real courage. That's what we want.
302619,L660359,u8954,m610,LION,Yeah!
302620,L660358,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,You humbug!
302621,L660299,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,This way!  Come on!
302622,L660298,u8954,m610,LION,Where -- where do we go now?
302623,L660272,u8954,m610,LION,Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
302624,L660271,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Stop pushing!
302625,L660260,u8954,m610,LION,Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
302626,L660259,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Come on -- I've got another idea.
302627,L660248,u8954,m610,LION,Now...
302628,L660247,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Up!
302629,L660240,u8954,m610,LION,"All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do."
302630,L660239,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,That's right.
302631,L660238,u8954,m610,LION,I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
302632,L660237,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Yes, you."
302633,L660236,u8954,m610,LION,Yeah. Me?
302634,L660235,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,And you're going to lead us.
302635,L660234,u8954,m610,LION,Fine.  He's got a plan
302636,L660233,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,I've got a plan how to get in there.
302637,L660189,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
302638,L660188,u8954,m610,LION,"They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?"
302639,L660083,u8954,m610,LION,What was that?
302640,L660082,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Here --   Come on.
302641,L660081,u8954,m610,LION,I -- Oh --
302642,L660080,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,"Oh, you did it yourself!"
302643,L660079,u8954,m610,LION,Somebody pulled my tail.
302644,L660078,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,What happened?
302645,L660068,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,What's the matter?

302762,L659888,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,I'd be gentle as a lizard --
302763,L659837,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,"Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears."
302764,L659836,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,Animals that -- that eat straw?

302773,L659774,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

302775,L660392,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious...."
302776,L660391,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,How can I ever thank you enough?

302782,L660372,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
302783,L660371,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"Well, I --"
302784,L660370,u8959,m610,SCARECROW,What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?

302795,L660398,u8964,m610,WIZARD,Yes -- ....
302796,L660397,u8960,m610,TIN MAN,But I still want one.
302797,L660396,u8964,m610,WIZARD,"As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart."
302798,L663196,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
302799,L663195,u8965,m611,BOND,I love Christmas in Turkey.
302800,L663192,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,We cant.
302801,L663191,u8965,m611,BOND,Weve got to get out.
302802,L663180,u8965,m611,BOND,Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
302803,L663179,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,But what if...
302804,L663178,u8965,m611,BOND,Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
302805,L663171,u8965,m611,BOND,Just wanted to put him on edge...
302806,L663170,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What kind of bikes did you ride?
302807,L663169,u8965,m611,BOND,Like riding a bike.
302808,L663168,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Do you know what youre doing?
302809,L663167,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Hes going to insert the plutonium.
302810,L663166,u8965,m611,BOND,Hes sealed himself in.
302811,L663156,u8965,m611,BOND,We go down to the torpedo bay.
302812,L663155,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Is there another way?
302813,L663103,u8965,m611,BOND,"If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead."
302814,L663102,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Zukovsky...
302815,L663073,u8965,m611,BOND,Elektra would control it all.
302816,L663072,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,The King pipeline.
302817,L663071,u8965,m611,BOND,Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
302818,L663070,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,"But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe..."
302819,L663067,u8965,m611,BOND,Made to look just like an accident.
302820,L663066,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,"Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown."
302821,L663065,u8965,m611,BOND,Nuclear.
302822,L662988,u8965,m611,BOND,She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
302823,L662987,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What is it?
302824,L662979,u8965,m611,BOND,I was hoping you could tell me.
302825,L662978,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
302826,L662977,u8965,m611,BOND,Makes her look even more innocent.
302827,L662976,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
302828,L662975,u8965,m611,BOND,Elektra King.
302829,L662974,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Whos she?
302830,L662973,u8965,m611,BOND,Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
302831,L662972,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What the hell are you talking about?
302832,L662971,u8965,m611,BOND,I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
302833,L662970,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
302834,L662953,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
302835,L662952,u8965,m611,BOND,Then its no longer a bomb?
302836,L662951,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
302837,L662945,u8965,m611,BOND,"Alright then, brunch."
302838,L662944,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
302839,L662943,u8965,m611,BOND,When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
302840,L662880,u8965,m611,BOND,With this?
302841,L662879,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
302842,L662877,u8965,m611,BOND,Bond --
302843,L662876,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,So who are you?
302844,L662875,u8965,m611,BOND,Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
302845,L662865,u8965,m611,BOND,"Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them."
302846,L662864,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
302847,L662836,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,"The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun."
302848,L662835,u8965,m611,BOND,Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
302849,L662834,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What happened to Len Tashka?
302850,L662833,u8965,m611,BOND,Dont know any doctor jokes.
302851,L662832,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,"Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all."
302852,L662831,u8965,m611,BOND,"Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?"
302853,L662830,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,You new?
302854,L662605,u8965,m611,BOND,I could come for a second opinion?
302855,L662604,u8967,m611,DOCTOR GREATREX,...yes?...
302856,L662603,u8965,m611,BOND,Perhaps after this ... test?
302857,L662602,u8967,m611,DOCTOR GREATREX,Then maybe Id be... open to that.
302858,L662598,u8967,m611,DOCTOR GREATREX,James.  It wouldnt really be...
302859,L662597,u8965,m611,BOND,Its just a scratch.
302860,L662596,u8965,m611,BOND,"I need you to pass me fit now, Molly."
302861,L662595,u8967,m611,DOCTOR GREATREX,Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
302862,L662921,u8965,m611,BOND,Is maybe...the inside woman.
302863,L662920,u8970,m611,M,The inside man?
302864,L662919,u8965,m611,BOND,"Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin..."
302865,L662918,u8970,m611,M,Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
302866,L662917,u8965,m611,BOND,The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
302867,L662651,u8965,m611,BOND,The worm on the hook again.
302868,L662650,u8970,m611,M,"Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that."
302869,L662647,u8965,m611,BOND,Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
302870,L662646,u8970,m611,M,Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
302871,L662645,u8965,m611,BOND,That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
302872,L662644,u8970,m611,M,"The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man."
302873,L662643,u8970,m611,M,"The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man."
302874,L662642,u8965,m611,BOND,He survived?
302875,L662640,u8970,m611,M,"How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again."
302876,L662639,u8965,m611,BOND,Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
302877,L662638,u8970,m611,M,"Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him."
302878,L662637,u8965,m611,BOND,Renard.
302879,L662636,u8970,m611,M,Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
302880,L662635,u8965,m611,BOND,Who?
302881,L662634,u8970,m611,M,Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
302882,L662632,u8965,m611,BOND,The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
302883,L662631,u8970,m611,M,"Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it."
302884,L662630,u8965,m611,BOND,I was the one who brought that money in...
302885,L662629,u8970,m611,M,You havent been given an assignment in this case.
302886,L662628,u8965,m611,BOND,I took the initiative.
302887,L662627,u8970,m611,M,Who told you to look at Elektras files?
302888,L662613,u8970,m611,M,"And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought."
302889,L662612,u8965,m611,BOND,"Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it."
302890,L662611,u8970,m611,M,007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
302891,L662593,u8970,m611,M,"Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose."
302892,L662592,u8965,m611,BOND,Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
302893,L662591,u8970,m611,M,Ive scheduled a medical for you.
302894,L662590,u8965,m611,BOND,Shes not a girl anymore.
302895,L662589,u8970,m611,M,Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
302896,L662566,u8965,m611,BOND,Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
302897,L662565,u8970,m611,M,Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
302898,L662564,u8965,m611,BOND,Old friend?
302899,L662563,u8970,m611,M,"Quite the opposite, in fact."
302900,L662562,u8965,m611,BOND,Constructions not exactly my line.
302901,L662549,u8969,m611,LACHAISE,"I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!"
302902,L662548,u8965,m611,BOND,The name?
302903,L662546,u8969,m611,LACHAISE,"Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?"
302904,L662545,u8965,m611,BOND,Your last chance. Give me the name.
302905,L662544,u8969,m611,LACHAISE,Your last chance. Take the money.
302906,L662543,u8965,m611,BOND,And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
302907,L662542,u8969,m611,LACHAISE,I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
302908,L662541,u8965,m611,BOND,Who did you get it from?
302909,L662540,u8969,m611,LACHAISE,I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
302910,L662532,u8965,m611,BOND,"Which is neutral, no doubt."
302911,L662531,u8969,m611,LACHAISE,"Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position.."
302912,L663163,u8965,m611,BOND,Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
302913,L663162,u8971,m611,RENARD,In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
302914,L662859,u8971,m611,RENARD,You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
302915,L662858,u8965,m611,BOND,Shell get over it.
302916,L662857,u8971,m611,RENARD,Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
302917,L662856,u8965,m611,BOND,Consider me ungrateful.
302918,L662855,u8971,m611,RENARD,Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
302919,L662854,u8965,m611,BOND,You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
302920,L662853,u8971,m611,RENARD,"You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed..."
302921,L662852,u8965,m611,BOND,Who is it?
302922,L662851,u8971,m611,RENARD,Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
302923,L662850,u8965,m611,BOND,Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
302924,L662844,u8965,m611,BOND,Indeed.
302925,L662843,u8971,m611,RENARD,I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
302926,L662586,u8973,m611,WOMAN,He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
302927,L662585,u8965,m611,BOND,Im sorry.
302928,L662584,u8973,m611,WOMAN,He was my father.
302929,L662583,u8965,m611,BOND,You knew him well?
302930,L662582,u8973,m611,WOMAN,A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
302931,L662581,u8965,m611,BOND,Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
302932,L662580,u8973,m611,WOMAN,"Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine."
302933,L662579,u8965,m611,BOND,Yes.
302934,L662578,u8973,m611,WOMAN,"Beautiful, isnt it?"
302935,L663134,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Oh James.
302936,L663133,u8965,m611,BOND,One... last... screw?
302937,L663130,u8965,m611,BOND,"Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die."
302938,L663129,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Know what happens when a man is strangled?
302939,L663126,u8965,m611,BOND,No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
302940,L663125,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people."
302941,L663124,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
302942,L663123,u8965,m611,BOND,Was this all about the oil?
302943,L663122,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
302944,L663121,u8965,m611,BOND,So you killed your father.
302945,L663119,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Just like you...only you were even easier.
302946,L663118,u8965,m611,BOND,You turned Renard.
302947,L663117,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance."
302948,L663116,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Five more turns and your neck will break.
302949,L663115,u8965,m611,BOND,"All this, because you fell for Renard?"
302950,L663114,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Soon shell be everywhere.
302951,L663113,u8965,m611,BOND,Wheres M?
302952,L663111,u8965,m611,BOND,Not interested.
302953,L663110,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I could have given you the world.
302954,L662912,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now."
302955,L662911,u8965,m611,BOND,Im coming with you.
302956,L662909,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?"
302957,L662908,u8965,m611,BOND,He used your exact words.
302958,L662907,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out."
302959,L662905,u8965,m611,BOND,I think you do.
302960,L662904,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I dont know what youre talking about!
302961,L662903,u8965,m611,BOND,"You can drop the act, its over."
302962,L662902,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
302963,L662901,u8965,m611,BOND,"We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me..."
302964,L662900,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,...what?
302965,L662899,u8965,m611,BOND,Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
302966,L662898,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,What are you talking about?
302967,L662897,u8965,m611,BOND,"A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?"
302968,L662896,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
302969,L662816,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
302970,L662815,u8965,m611,BOND,How did you survive?
302971,L662809,u8965,m611,BOND,Shush.
302972,L662808,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
302973,L662799,u8965,m611,BOND,Not at that price. Time to surrender.
302974,L662798,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Surely you believe in living dangerously.
302975,L662783,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Really?
302976,L662782,u8965,m611,BOND,I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
302977,L662777,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill."
302978,L662776,u8965,m611,BOND,"If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now."
302979,L662775,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?"
302980,L662774,u8965,m611,BOND,What the hell are you doing here?
302981,L662773,u8965,m611,BOND,Two. Shaken not stirred.
302982,L662772,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Vodka martini.
302983,L662744,u8965,m611,BOND,I have to go to work.
302984,L662743,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I dont want to be safe!
302985,L662742,u8965,m611,BOND,No. Youll be safe here.
302986,L662741,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Then take me with you.
302987,L662740,u8965,m611,BOND,I have to go.
302988,L662739,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,James...
302989,L662738,u8965,m611,BOND,...you should rest.
302990,L662737,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,What is it?
302991,L662736,u8965,m611,BOND,I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
302992,L662735,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward."
302993,L662729,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I know.
302994,L662728,u8965,m611,BOND,I cant stay.
302995,L662723,u8965,m611,BOND,Its the only way out...
302996,L662722,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,No!  It will cave in!
302997,L662721,u8965,m611,BOND,Youre not going to.
302998,L662720,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I cant stay here.
302999,L662719,u8965,m611,BOND,Were alright.
303000,L662718,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Oh my God...were buried alive...
303001,L662708,u8965,m611,BOND,No.
303002,L662707,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"You dont take no for an answer, do you?"
303003,L662706,u8965,m611,BOND,Always wanted to see the upper lines.
303004,L662705,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
303005,L662698,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it."
303006,L662697,u8965,m611,BOND,I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
303007,L662696,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed."
303008,L662695,u8965,m611,BOND,"The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over..."
303009,L662694,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third..."
303010,L662693,u8965,m611,BOND,"Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company."
303011,L662692,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
303012,L662691,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
303013,L662690,u8965,m611,BOND,Does this look familiar to you?
303014,L662689,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
303015,L662688,u8965,m611,BOND,How long has he been with you?
303016,L662687,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette."
303017,L662686,u8965,m611,BOND,Who is he?
303018,L662683,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"Partially, yes."
303019,L662682,u8965,m611,BOND,Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
303020,L662681,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
303021,L662680,u8965,m611,BOND,Funerals arent exactly memorable.
303022,L662679,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
303023,L662678,u8965,m611,BOND,Yes.
303024,L662677,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,I met you at my fathers funeral.
303025,L663101,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
303026,L663100,u8965,m611,BOND,How appropriate.
303027,L663099,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,The Maidens Tower.
303028,L663069,u8965,m611,BOND,"The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea."
303029,L663068,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,Mother of God.
303030,L663043,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,Istanbul.
303031,L663042,u8965,m611,BOND,Where?
303032,L663041,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people."
303033,L663036,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!"
303034,L663035,u8965,m611,BOND,This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
303035,L663034,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,No!  Get me out!
303036,L663033,u8965,m611,BOND,Wheres the sub going?!
303037,L663030,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
303038,L663029,u8965,m611,BOND,And the payoff on the tables?
303039,L663028,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff."
303040,L663024,u8965,m611,BOND,No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
303041,L663023,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,A rope!
303042,L663022,u8965,m611,BOND,Now...where were we?
303043,L663018,u8965,m611,BOND,You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
303044,L663017,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!"
303045,L663016,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
303046,L663015,u8965,m611,BOND,She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
303047,L663014,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,I thought you were the one in her business.
303048,L663013,u8965,m611,BOND,Whats your business with Elektra King?
303049,L663012,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?"
303050,L663011,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship."
303051,L663010,u8965,m611,BOND,Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
303052,L663009,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?"
303053,L662766,u8965,m611,BOND,But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
303054,L662765,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you."
303055,L662764,u8965,m611,BOND,How high up does this...arms dealing go?
303056,L662763,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
303057,L662761,u8965,m611,BOND,Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
303058,L662760,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,Where did you get this?
303059,L662759,u8965,m611,BOND,If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
303060,L662758,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,What?  This is not possible.
303061,L662757,u8965,m611,BOND,How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
303062,L662756,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
303063,L662751,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House."
303064,L662750,u8965,m611,BOND,"Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest."
303065,L662749,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble..."
303066,L662748,u8965,m611,BOND,"You, of course. I need some information."
303067,L662747,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
303068,L662746,u8965,m611,BOND,Valentin Zukovsky.
303069,L663064,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,C-class.
303070,L663063,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What class sub does your nephew run?
303071,L663062,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo."
303072,L663059,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
303073,L663058,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What is this place?
303074,L663038,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,Bond!
303075,L663037,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,No! Bond!
303076,L663032,u8974,m611,ZUKOVSKY,"To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet."
303077,L663031,u8966,m611,CHRISTMAS,What?
303078,L663087,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
303079,L663086,u8970,m611,M,Someone will come.
303080,L663085,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,"Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you."
303081,L663001,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
303082,L663000,u8970,m611,M,Your father...
303083,L662999,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
303084,L662965,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Please.
303085,L662964,u8970,m611,M,Perhaps this isnt the time...
303086,L662890,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Could...could you come?
303087,L662889,u8970,m611,M,Ill send someone out.
303088,L663141,u8971,m611,RENARD,Yes.  Au revoir...
303089,L663140,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
303090,L663093,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
303091,L663092,u8971,m611,RENARD,This is the end.
303092,L663049,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,What do you think?
303093,L663048,u8971,m611,RENARD,He was a...good lover?
303094,L663047,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Of course...
303095,L663046,u8971,m611,RENARD,Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
303096,L663045,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,How would you know?
303097,L663044,u8971,m611,RENARD,"So beautiful. So smooth, so warm."
303098,L662994,u8971,m611,RENARD,Is it?
303099,L662993,u8968,m611,ELEKTRA,Warm.
303100,L663194,u8972,m611,TANNER,Still no contact yet.
303101,L663193,u8970,m611,M,Any word from him?
303102,L662931,u8970,m611,M,Where it can do the most damage.
303103,L662930,u8972,m611,TANNER,Its heading for the oil terminal.
303104,L662929,u8970,m611,M,The parcels in the post.
303105,L662883,u8970,m611,M,Marvellous.
303106,L662882,u8972,m611,TANNER,"Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan..."
303107,L662881,u8970,m611,M,Do we have the range of Renards plane?
303108,L662609,u8972,m611,TANNER,And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
303109,L662608,u8970,m611,M,Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
303110,L663447,u8975,m612,ADAMSON,Please.
303111,L663446,u8985,m612,LAURIE,What?!
303112,L663445,u8975,m612,ADAMSON,The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
303113,L663444,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I would like to use the bathroom --
303114,L663443,u8975,m612,ADAMSON,I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
303115,L663442,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Why?  What's the problem?
303116,L663441,u8975,m612,ADAMSON,"Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me."
303117,L663440,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door."
303118,L663643,u8987,m612,PRESIDENT,The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
303119,L663642,u8976,m612,ANALYST,"We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather."
303120,L663641,u8987,m612,PRESIDENT,"What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter"" theory?"
303121,L663640,u8976,m612,ANALYST,"As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt."
303122,L663638,u8976,m612,ANALYST,"Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order."
303123,L663637,u8987,m612,PRESIDENT,What kind of time frame are we talking about?
303124,L663636,u8976,m612,ANALYST,"Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through."
303125,L663635,u8987,m612,PRESIDENT,What about our end?
303126,L663303,u8977,m612,BURNS,They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
303127,L663302,u8981,m612,HYDE,Washington?
303128,L663301,u8977,m612,BURNS,He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
303129,L663300,u8981,m612,HYDE,"Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight."
303130,L663299,u8977,m612,BURNS,No idea who's behind this?
303131,L663298,u8981,m612,HYDE,You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
303132,L663297,u8977,m612,BURNS,Had a lot of blood in him.
303133,L663846,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,"Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?"
303134,L663845,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,"That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --"
303135,L663829,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,We don't know that.
303136,L663828,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,God isn't there to do it.
303137,L663827,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
303138,L663826,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,"Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog."
303139,L663825,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
303140,L663824,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,Who is she?  Do you know her?
303141,L663823,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,A whore fucking.
303142,L663779,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
303143,L663778,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,"There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you."
303144,L663777,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Wrong answers?
303145,L663776,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
303146,L663775,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Don't call me that.
303147,L663774,u8978,m612,DR. LONG,Walter --
303148,L664176,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
303149,L664175,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?"
303150,L663366,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
303151,L663365,u8990,m612,VEIDT,I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
303152,L663363,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
303153,L663362,u8990,m612,VEIDT,What's your theory?
303154,L663361,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
303155,L663360,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen."
303156,L663357,u8990,m612,VEIDT,We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
303157,L663356,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,The bearer of bad news.
303158,L663352,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Hello, Adrian."
303159,L663351,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Hi, Jon."
303160,L664185,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
303161,L664184,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?"
303162,L664183,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now."
303163,L664182,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Jon --
303164,L664169,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Veidts complex.
303165,L664168,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Jon, where are we?"
303166,L664155,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,The south pole.  Times flowing backwards.
303167,L664154,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Jon -- what??
303168,L664153,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . .
303169,L664141,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Cured, yes."
303170,L664140,u8985,m612,LAURIE,What -- am I --
303171,L664139,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
303172,L664138,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
303173,L664137,u8985,m612,LAURIE,You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
303174,L664136,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,I won't do that.
303175,L664135,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me."
303176,L664134,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,You're the only human being I care for.
303177,L664133,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
303178,L664132,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
303179,L664131,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Jon, I do not want to hear it."
303180,L664082,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see."
303181,L664081,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
303182,L664080,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
303183,L664079,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?"
303184,L664078,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Because --
303185,L664077,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
303186,L664076,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Always.  Ever since the day I died.
303187,L664075,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
303188,L664074,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that."
303189,L664073,u8985,m612,LAURIE,But you knew that I'd -- die.
303190,L664072,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did."
303191,L664071,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
303192,L664070,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you."
303193,L664069,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
303194,L664067,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds."
303195,L664066,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised."
303196,L664065,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
303197,L664064,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms."
303198,L664062,u8985,m612,LAURIE,You -- you know about me and Dan?
303199,L664061,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg."
303200,L664060,u8985,m612,LAURIE,This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
303201,L664047,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --"
303202,L664046,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
303203,L664041,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it."
303204,L664040,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Jon, no -- I can't --"
303205,L664039,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
303206,L664038,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Collect me?
303207,L664037,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
303208,L663397,u8985,m612,LAURIE,. . . And just how would you manage that?
303209,L663396,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,I could stay and go.
303210,L663395,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Mm hmm.
303211,L663394,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Would you like me to stay?
303212,L663392,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"Not yet, there's plenty of time."
303213,L663391,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
303214,L663390,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,"I'm here, Laurie."
303215,L663359,u8979,m612,DR. MANHATTAN,Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
303216,L663358,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Blake?  Dead?
303217,L664172,u8990,m612,VEIDT,We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
303218,L664171,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
303219,L664170,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered."
303220,L664165,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
303221,L664164,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What if youre wrong??
303222,L664163,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Im not.
303223,L664162,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,And what if youre wrong?
303224,L664161,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?"
303225,L664150,u8990,m612,VEIDT,I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
303226,L664149,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Adrian -- you've lost it.
303227,L664148,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --"
303228,L664147,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What is it?  How does it work?
303229,L664146,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits."
303230,L664128,u8990,m612,VEIDT,It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
303231,L664127,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
303232,L664126,u8990,m612,VEIDT,It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
303233,L664117,u8990,m612,VEIDT,I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
303234,L664116,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What??
303235,L664111,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
303236,L664110,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,The missing scientists.
303237,L664109,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . ."
303238,L663803,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know."
303239,L663802,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me."
303240,L663801,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,She's with me.
303241,L663800,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?"
303242,L663799,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Who?
303243,L663343,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Good night.
303244,L663342,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night."
303245,L663341,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,No.  I just wanted you to --
303246,L663340,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?"
303247,L663339,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
303248,L663338,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over."
303249,L663337,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood."
303250,L663336,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
303251,L663335,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us."
303252,L663334,u8990,m612,VEIDT,My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
303253,L663333,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
303254,L664215,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?"
303255,L664214,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --"
303256,L664213,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Dan -- what do we do now?
303257,L664201,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Everything's changed --
303258,L664200,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Those cars.  What year is this??
303259,L664199,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Dan, is this -- is this New York??"
303260,L664196,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Where did he go?
303261,L664195,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,He saved himself.  He changed the past.
303262,L664179,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
303263,L664178,u8985,m612,LAURIE,What was he doing?
303264,L664018,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
303265,L664017,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Welcome back, Night Owl."
303266,L664001,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
303267,L664000,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
303268,L663985,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --"
303269,L663984,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I think he's going to the john.
303270,L663983,u8985,m612,LAURIE,What's he doing?
303271,L663949,u8985,m612,LAURIE,. . . What??
303272,L663948,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
303273,L663947,u8985,m612,LAURIE,You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
303274,L663946,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
303275,L663945,u8985,m612,LAURIE,That's because --
303276,L663944,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years."
303277,L663943,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Yes you are.
303278,L663942,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
303279,L663941,u8985,m612,LAURIE,The costumes.  Am I right?
303280,L663940,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What?
303281,L663923,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
303282,L663922,u8985,m612,LAURIE,They're practically on us . . .
303283,L663921,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
303284,L663920,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
303285,L663915,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,All right.  Mission accomplished.
303286,L663914,u8985,m612,LAURIE,They're following us.
303287,L663891,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No."
303288,L663890,u8985,m612,LAURIE,It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
303289,L663889,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What the hell -- ?
303290,L663869,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Okay!
303291,L663868,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,This'd better not be what I think it is.
303292,L663867,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Don't look.  Turn around.
303293,L663866,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What are you up to?
303294,L663865,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around."
303295,L663864,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract."
303296,L663863,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
303297,L663861,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,You and me.
303298,L663860,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
303299,L663859,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
303300,L663858,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Antarctica??
303301,L663857,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
303302,L663854,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
303303,L663853,u8985,m612,LAURIE,The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
303304,L663849,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Memory lane.
303305,L663848,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?"
303306,L663810,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours."
303307,L663809,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --"
303308,L663808,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Laurie --
303309,L663807,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
303310,L663806,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,-- What is it.
303311,L663805,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
303312,L663804,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
303313,L663758,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
303314,L663757,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
303315,L663754,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
303316,L663753,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that."
303317,L663725,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
303318,L663724,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,. . . What?
303319,L663723,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one."
303320,L663722,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Old?
303321,L663721,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . ."
303322,L663720,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
303323,L663719,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!"
303324,L663718,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
303325,L663706,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Play one.  Educate yourself.
303326,L663705,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
303327,L663704,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
303328,L663697,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
303329,L663696,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,His . . . whatever.
303330,L663695,u8985,m612,LAURIE,His what?
303331,L663663,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?"
303332,L663662,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --"
303333,L663658,u8985,m612,LAURIE,You're sure?
303334,L663657,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay."
303335,L663656,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --"
303336,L663654,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --"
303337,L663653,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Maybe not, but why take chances?"
303338,L663652,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen."
303339,L663651,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . ."
303340,L663650,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live."
303341,L663649,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?"
303342,L663432,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
303343,L663431,u8985,m612,LAURIE,That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
303344,L663430,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
303345,L663429,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
303346,L663428,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . ."
303347,L663427,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits."
303348,L663426,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Damn straight!  We were heroes.
303349,L663425,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Damn straight.
303350,L663421,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,
303351,L663420,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices."
303352,L663419,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --"
303353,L663418,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
303354,L663417,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
303355,L663416,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa."
303356,L663415,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?"
303357,L664160,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
303358,L664159,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
303359,L664108,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --"
303360,L664107,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
303361,L664106,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
303362,L664088,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
303363,L664087,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,What caused it?
303364,L664086,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
303365,L664085,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,What happened?
303366,L664057,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Okay, let's just . . . thank you."
303367,L664056,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,"Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie."
303368,L664055,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"SHUT UP, Rorschach."
303369,L664054,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Coward.  Giving up.
303370,L664053,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter."
303371,L664052,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
303372,L664051,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's."
303373,L664044,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I don't think she's coming with us.
303374,L664043,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Where's Laurie?
303375,L664024,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --"
303376,L664023,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
303377,L664022,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
303378,L664021,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
303379,L664020,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"What do you mean, frame-up?"
303380,L664019,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
303381,L663999,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . .
303382,L663998,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,What new information?
303383,L663997,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
303384,L663996,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
303385,L663987,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
303386,L663986,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,. . . That was quick.
303387,L663327,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?"
303388,L663326,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
303389,L663325,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,"Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia."
303390,L663324,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,So do I.  So do you.
303391,L663322,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
303392,L663321,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
303393,L663319,u8980,m612,DREIBERG,Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
303394,L663318,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,"Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see."
303395,L663545,u8983,m612,JON,My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
303396,L663544,u8982,m612,JANEY,-- What?
303397,L663543,u8983,m612,JON,I can fix it.
303398,L663539,u8983,m612,JON,"Janey, will you marry me?"
303399,L663538,u8982,m612,JANEY,Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
303400,L663536,u8982,m612,JANEY,"We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?"
303401,L663535,u8983,m612,JON,Nothing.  What were you going to say?
303402,L663534,u8982,m612,JANEY,We should get back --  What?
303403,L663533,u8983,m612,JON,"Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --"
303404,L663532,u8982,m612,JANEY,"Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?"
303405,L663531,u8983,m612,JON,Nothing wrong with ketchup.
303406,L663530,u8982,m612,JANEY,With lots of ketchup?
303407,L663529,u8983,m612,JON,"I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak."
303408,L663787,u8984,m612,JUSTINE,Isn't it true that you --
303409,L663786,u8990,m612,VEIDT,I did not.  Now get out of my way!
303410,L663785,u8984,m612,JUSTINE,Did you know he was back on the streets?
303411,L663784,u8990,m612,VEIDT,No comment.
303412,L663682,u8990,m612,VEIDT,No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
303413,L663681,u8984,m612,JUSTINE,"Oh sweetheart, just a quick one."
303414,L663680,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen."
303415,L663679,u8984,m612,JUSTINE,"Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --"
303416,L663678,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?"
303417,L663599,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
303418,L663598,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Jon??  You mean he's --
303419,L663597,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,"Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out."
303420,L663596,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --"
303421,L663595,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
303422,L663594,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Am I free to go?
303423,L663593,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,"All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things."
303424,L663468,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --"
303425,L663467,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
303426,L663466,u8985,m612,LAURIE,What does this mean?  What does it --
303427,L663465,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,I'm terribly sorry.
303428,L663464,u8985,m612,LAURIE,What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
303429,L663463,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,"Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer."
303430,L663462,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Then why don't you ask him?!?
303431,L663461,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,"You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --"
303432,L663460,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I don't know their real names!
303433,L663459,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,"You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk."
303434,L663458,u8985,m612,LAURIE,I don't know their real names.
303435,L663457,u8989,m612,SCHMIDT,"Their real names, please."
303436,L663379,u8990,m612,VEIDT,I'm sorry about Blake.
303437,L663378,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Maybe I'll do that.
303438,L663377,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you."
303439,L663376,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards."
303440,L663375,u8990,m612,VEIDT,What about you?
303441,L663374,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --"
303442,L663373,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
303443,L663372,u8985,m612,LAURIE,"Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams."
303444,L663371,u8990,m612,VEIDT,He's a little farther gone every time.
303445,L663370,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Please.
303446,L663369,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"I'll take a raincheck, Laurie."
303447,L663368,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
303448,L663350,u8985,m612,LAURIE,He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
303449,L663349,u8990,m612,VEIDT,And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
303450,L663348,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Don't rub it in.  I live here.
303451,L663347,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Laurie!  Good to see you.
303452,L663346,u8985,m612,LAURIE,Adrian.
303453,L663671,u8986,m612,MOLOCH,"No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you."
303454,L663670,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
303455,L663629,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
303456,L663628,u8986,m612,MOLOCH,CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
303457,L663627,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
303458,L663626,u8986,m612,MOLOCH,"Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --"
303459,L663622,u8986,m612,MOLOCH,ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
303460,L663621,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
303461,L663620,u8986,m612,MOLOCH,You're making a big --
303462,L663619,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,"Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch."
303463,L663618,u8986,m612,MOLOCH,"I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy."
303464,L664123,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at."
303465,L664122,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,"Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt."
303466,L664119,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer."
303467,L664118,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
303468,L664113,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world."
303469,L664112,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
303470,L663691,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,"Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press."
303471,L663690,u8990,m612,VEIDT,"Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad."
303472,L663689,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
303473,L663688,u8990,m612,VEIDT,What is that ungodly smell?
303474,L663687,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
303475,L663686,u8990,m612,VEIDT,Ever see one of these before?
303476,L663685,u8988,m612,RORSCHACH,New information.
303477,L665331,u9000,m613,XANDER,"You're a jerk-off, you know that?"
303478,L665330,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
303479,L665329,u9000,m613,XANDER,"No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?"
303480,L665328,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?"
303481,L665327,u9000,m613,XANDER,Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
303482,L665326,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside."
303483,L665325,u9000,m613,XANDER,Who says you're the good guys?
303484,L665324,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys."
303485,L665323,u9000,m613,XANDER,"But I hate cops, remember? Except for her."
303486,L665322,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent."
303487,L665321,u9000,m613,XANDER,I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
303488,L665320,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you."
303489,L665247,u9000,m613,XANDER,"We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill."
303490,L665246,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now."
303491,L665245,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules."
303492,L665244,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back."
303493,L665243,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?"
303494,L665242,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity."
303495,L665241,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that."
303496,L665240,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,Yes it does.
303497,L665239,u9000,m613,XANDER,"They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that ""classified"" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song ""Silent Night"" mean anything to you?"
303498,L665238,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
303499,L665237,u9000,m613,XANDER,Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
303500,L665162,u9000,m613,XANDER,You ain't seen nothing yet.
303501,L665161,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work."
303502,L665160,u9000,m613,XANDER,Thanks.
303503,L665159,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
303504,L665158,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?"
303505,L665157,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this ""Ahab""."
303506,L665156,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac."
303507,L665155,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You did say ""Ahab""? You're sure about that?"
303508,L664955,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out."
303509,L664954,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"My friend, if you're planning on crossing me..."
303510,L664953,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?"
303511,L664952,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period."
303512,L664951,u9000,m613,XANDER,What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
303513,L664950,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,We're not after car thieves here.
303514,L664949,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?"
303515,L664948,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
303516,L664947,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money."
303517,L664946,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X."
303518,L664945,u9000,m613,XANDER,I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
303519,L664869,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Just remember, I'll be watching."
303520,L664868,u9000,m613,XANDER,Is that all?
303521,L664867,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene."
303522,L664866,u9000,m613,XANDER,Up yours.
303523,L664863,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5."
303524,L664862,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
303525,L664859,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Yeah, I spy or I die."
303526,L664858,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?"
303527,L664857,u9000,m613,XANDER,How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
303528,L664849,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"What's with that ""X"" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're ""extreme""? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head."
303529,L664848,u9000,m613,XANDER,Not bad for a gimp.
303530,L664847,u9000,m613,XANDER,"You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along."
303531,L664846,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath."
303532,L664845,u9000,m613,XANDER,What do I get out of it?
303533,L664844,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people."
303534,L664843,u9000,m613,XANDER,Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
303535,L664839,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
303536,L664838,u9000,m613,XANDER,I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
303537,L664837,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
303538,L664836,u9000,m613,XANDER,I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
303539,L664835,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help."
303540,L664834,u9000,m613,XANDER,"You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy."
303541,L664833,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution."
303542,L664832,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
303543,L664831,u9000,m613,XANDER,You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
303544,L664830,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class."
303545,L664772,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
303546,L664771,u9000,m613,XANDER,You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
303547,L664770,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea."
303548,L664769,u9000,m613,XANDER,Is that a fact?
303549,L664768,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me."
303550,L664767,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking."
303551,L664766,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years."
303552,L664765,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble."
303553,L664764,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,Why is that?
303554,L664763,u9000,m613,XANDER,"..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy."
303555,L664762,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. ""Many are called, few are chosen"", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?"
303556,L664761,u9000,m613,XANDER,"A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch."
303557,L664760,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
303558,L664759,u9000,m613,XANDER,Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
303559,L664758,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character."
303560,L664757,u9000,m613,XANDER,"That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?"
303561,L664756,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
303562,L664753,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a ""salesman"" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a ""trucker"", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I ""walked"" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?"
303563,L664752,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,Looks like a diner.
303564,L664751,u9000,m613,XANDER,What is this place?
303565,L664750,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
303566,L664749,u9000,m613,XANDER,Who the hell are you?
303567,L664964,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
303568,L664963,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,"Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad."
303569,L664962,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,"Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?"
303570,L664961,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen."
303571,L664960,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
303572,L664959,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely."
303573,L664958,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,You what? A wire transfer of this size?
303574,L664957,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,I think we should send him whatever he wants.
303575,L664956,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,"Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time."
303576,L664695,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,That's exactly why we need them.
303577,L664694,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
303578,L664693,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,I've seen enough. Turn it off.
303579,L664692,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,But programmable. And expendable.
303580,L664691,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,The scum of the Earth.
303581,L664690,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde..."
303582,L664689,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop."
303583,L664688,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
303584,L664687,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own."
303585,L664686,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,How will you fix it?
303586,L664685,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it."
303587,L664684,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
303588,L664683,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
303589,L664682,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
303590,L664681,u8991,m613,GIBBONS,"Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called ""Ahab"". Whatever it is, it cost him his life."
303591,L664680,u8995,m613,SAM TANNICK,What do you have?
303592,L664809,u8992,m613,JEFE,"Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?"
303593,L664808,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest."
303594,L664807,u8992,m613,JEFE,You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
303595,L664806,u9000,m613,XANDER,"We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'."
303596,L664800,u9000,m613,XANDER,We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
303597,L664799,u8992,m613,JEFE,"We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?"
303598,L664798,u8992,m613,JEFE,"That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard."
303599,L664797,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Oh, I don't know. It was an accident."
303600,L664796,u8992,m613,JEFE,Whatchu doing here?
303601,L664891,u8993,m613,KID,He gets to be the hero.
303602,L664890,u9000,m613,XANDER,Like what?
303603,L664889,u8993,m613,KID,Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
303604,L664888,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive."
303605,L664887,u8993,m613,KID,What do you get if you finish?
303606,L664886,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through."
303607,L664885,u8993,m613,KID,What weapons do you have?
303608,L664884,u9000,m613,XANDER,What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
303609,L664883,u8993,m613,KID,"""Anarchy"" 99""?"
303610,L664882,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it ""blood week"". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99."
303611,L664879,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the ""Finger of God"". Assassination and weapons."
303612,L664878,u8993,m613,KID,This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
303613,L664877,u8993,m613,KID,Naturally.
303614,L664876,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade."
303615,L664874,u9000,m613,XANDER,You wanna check it out? Come here.
303616,L664873,u8993,m613,KID,Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
303617,L664872,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called ""Anarchy 99"", they're the bad guy bosses."
303618,L664871,u8993,m613,KID,What game is that?
303619,L665336,u9000,m613,XANDER,It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
303620,L665335,u8994,m613,PETRA,What are you doing?
303621,L665334,u9000,m613,XANDER,You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
303622,L665333,u8994,m613,PETRA,I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
303623,L665314,u9000,m613,XANDER,Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
303624,L665313,u8994,m613,PETRA,By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
303625,L665312,u9000,m613,XANDER,"It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?"
303626,L665311,u8994,m613,PETRA,It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
303627,L665309,u9000,m613,XANDER,A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
303628,L665308,u8994,m613,PETRA,"No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls."
303629,L665307,u9000,m613,XANDER,You can't talk to it?
303630,L665306,u8994,m613,PETRA,He's shut out the communication circuit!
303631,L665303,u9000,m613,XANDER,I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
303632,L665302,u8994,m613,PETRA,A piece of shrapnel hit me.
303633,L665301,u9000,m613,XANDER,You okay?
303634,L665298,u8994,m613,PETRA,Let me.
303635,L665297,u9000,m613,XANDER,Toadies right behind.
303636,L665296,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Go to the water, it's that way!"
303637,L665295,u9000,m613,XANDER,Where'd the damn truck go?!
303638,L665289,u8994,m613,PETRA,He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
303639,L665288,u9000,m613,XANDER,Where's he headed?
303640,L665287,u9000,m613,XANDER,Let's do this.
303641,L665286,u8994,m613,PETRA,"If they launch it, I know how to bring it back."
303642,L665285,u9000,m613,XANDER,Did you do your homework?
303643,L665282,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them."
303644,L665281,u8994,m613,PETRA,Yorgi and Kirill.
303645,L665270,u9000,m613,XANDER,He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
303646,L665269,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three."
303647,L665230,u8994,m613,PETRA,"What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet."
303648,L665229,u9000,m613,XANDER,"When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation."
303649,L665228,u8994,m613,PETRA,"I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt."
303650,L665227,u9000,m613,XANDER,Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
303651,L665226,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside."
303652,L665225,u9000,m613,XANDER,You don't have to do that.
303653,L665224,u8994,m613,PETRA,"I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi."
303654,L665223,u9000,m613,XANDER,"A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine."
303655,L665222,u8994,m613,PETRA,Aren't you afraid?
303656,L665221,u9000,m613,XANDER,We'll have to go after them.
303657,L665220,u8994,m613,PETRA,They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
303658,L665218,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said."
303659,L665217,u9000,m613,XANDER,We can't leave now. We have to do something.
303660,L665216,u8994,m613,PETRA,"No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?"
303661,L665215,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that."
303662,L665214,u8994,m613,PETRA,"What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me."
303663,L665213,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!"
303664,L665212,u8994,m613,PETRA,"It doesn't matter anymore, forget it."
303665,L665211,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?"
303666,L665210,u8994,m613,PETRA,We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
303667,L665209,u9000,m613,XANDER,Where are we going?
303668,L665208,u8994,m613,PETRA,"I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now."
303669,L665207,u9000,m613,XANDER,What are you doing with the Ivans?
303670,L665206,u9000,m613,XANDER,I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
303671,L665205,u8994,m613,PETRA,I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
303672,L665204,u9000,m613,XANDER,What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
303673,L665203,u8994,m613,PETRA,Are you alright?
303674,L665179,u8994,m613,PETRA,"You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?"
303675,L665178,u9000,m613,XANDER,When can I see you again?
303676,L665177,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice."
303677,L665176,u9000,m613,XANDER,Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
303678,L665175,u8994,m613,PETRA,"No, I guess I've been no help at all to you."
303679,L665174,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger."
303680,L665173,u8994,m613,PETRA,"I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal."
303681,L665172,u9000,m613,XANDER,You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
303682,L665171,u8994,m613,PETRA,I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
303683,L665170,u9000,m613,XANDER,What's that?
303684,L665169,u8994,m613,PETRA,There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
303685,L665168,u9000,m613,XANDER,We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
303686,L665167,u8994,m613,PETRA,"No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece."
303687,L665166,u9000,m613,XANDER,So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
303688,L665132,u9000,m613,XANDER,"They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now."
303689,L665131,u8994,m613,PETRA,I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
303690,L665129,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down."
303691,L665128,u8994,m613,PETRA,"That's alright, I'll figure something out."
303692,L665127,u9000,m613,XANDER,"If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me."
303693,L665126,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people."
303694,L665125,u9000,m613,XANDER,"It's a long story, but yeah, more or less."
303695,L665124,u8994,m613,PETRA,There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
303696,L665123,u9000,m613,XANDER,What are you talking about?
303697,L665122,u8994,m613,PETRA,They tell me you're an American agent.
303698,L665116,u9000,m613,XANDER,"So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?"
303699,L665115,u8994,m613,PETRA,A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
303700,L665114,u9000,m613,XANDER,We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
303701,L665113,u8994,m613,PETRA,All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
303702,L665112,u9000,m613,XANDER,"The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business."
303703,L665111,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?"
303704,L665110,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound."
303705,L665109,u8994,m613,PETRA,"You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you."
303706,L665108,u9000,m613,XANDER,Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
303707,L665107,u8994,m613,PETRA,Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
303708,L665106,u9000,m613,XANDER,Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
303709,L665105,u8994,m613,PETRA,So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
303710,L665104,u9000,m613,XANDER,I'm from L.A.
303711,L665103,u8994,m613,PETRA,That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
303712,L665098,u9000,m613,XANDER,I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
303713,L665097,u8994,m613,PETRA,What are you?
303714,L665095,u9000,m613,XANDER,Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
303715,L665094,u8994,m613,PETRA,Go to hell!
303716,L665093,u9000,m613,XANDER,"The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra."
303717,L665092,u8994,m613,PETRA,I don't know what you're talking about.
303718,L665084,u9000,m613,XANDER,"That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?"
303719,L665083,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are."
303720,L665082,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Hey, you're good."
303721,L665081,u9000,m613,XANDER,"You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid."
303722,L665080,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets."
303723,L665079,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck."
303724,L665078,u8994,m613,PETRA,"I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?"
303725,L665077,u9000,m613,XANDER,"We hung out last night, remember?"
303726,L665076,u8994,m613,PETRA,Who are you?
303727,L665049,u9000,m613,XANDER,That right? Why's that?
303728,L665048,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type."
303729,L665047,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you."
303730,L665046,u8994,m613,PETRA,"I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions."
303731,L665045,u9000,m613,XANDER,I was invited. What's your story?
303732,L665044,u8994,m613,PETRA,"Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home."
303733,L665043,u9000,m613,XANDER,Where are you going?
303734,L665042,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you."
303735,L665041,u8994,m613,PETRA,Mind your business.
303736,L665040,u9000,m613,XANDER,"It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?"
303737,L665039,u8994,m613,PETRA,Go to hell.
303738,L665038,u9000,m613,XANDER,You do everything Yorgi says?
303739,L665037,u8994,m613,PETRA,Yorgi asked me to.
303740,L665036,u9000,m613,XANDER,"If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?"
303741,L664938,u8994,m613,PETRA,So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
303742,L664937,u9000,m613,XANDER,Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
303743,L664936,u8994,m613,PETRA,"My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot."
303744,L664935,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation."
303745,L664934,u8994,m613,PETRA,Do you know what a wire transfer is?
303746,L664933,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max."
303747,L664932,u8994,m613,PETRA,Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
303748,L665260,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Nice place to start, don't you think?"
303749,L665259,u8994,m613,PETRA,The Peace conference...
303750,L665148,u9001,m613,YORGI,Viktor! Stay the course.
303751,L665147,u8994,m613,PETRA,Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
303752,L665146,u9001,m613,YORGI,"You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared."
303753,L665145,u8994,m613,PETRA,I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
303754,L665144,u9001,m613,YORGI,What was that for?
303755,L665139,u9001,m613,YORGI,It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
303756,L665138,u8994,m613,PETRA,What are you doing?
303757,L664998,u9001,m613,YORGI,Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
303758,L664997,u8994,m613,PETRA,Nothing. He had two days.
303759,L664994,u9000,m613,XANDER,I thought that was in detail.
303760,L664993,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,"Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail."
303761,L664992,u9000,m613,XANDER,"You're joking, right?"
303762,L664991,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,"It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute."
303763,L664990,u9000,m613,XANDER,From the Beastie Boys collection?
303764,L664989,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,"Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list."
303765,L664988,u9000,m613,XANDER,I think I'll hang on to these.
303766,L664984,u9000,m613,XANDER,That one I'm real familiar with.
303767,L664983,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,This is your standard dart gun.
303768,L664982,u9000,m613,XANDER,They come in any other styles or colors?
303769,L664981,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,"Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface."
303770,L664975,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,"Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir."
303771,L664974,u9000,m613,XANDER,Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
303772,L664973,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,"Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest."
303773,L664972,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people."
303774,L664971,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,"Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up."
303775,L664967,u9000,m613,XANDER,That's would be me.
303776,L664966,u8996,m613,SHAVERS,Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
303777,L664722,u8997,m613,SKY,You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
303778,L664721,u9000,m613,XANDER,"You're not exactly ""going anywhere"" yourself."
303779,L664720,u8997,m613,SKY,"You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere."
303780,L664719,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is."
303781,L664718,u8997,m613,SKY,This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
303782,L664717,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?"
303783,L664716,u8997,m613,SKY,You're serious?
303784,L664715,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I was gonna wait till the islands, but..."
303785,L664714,u8997,m613,SKY,What...?
303786,L664713,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now."
303787,L664712,u8997,m613,SKY,"It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability."
303788,L664711,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Alright, so I'll get more."
303789,L664710,u8997,m613,SKY,French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
303790,L664708,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money..."
303791,L664707,u8997,m613,SKY,"You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much ""integrity"" for that."
303792,L664706,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I'm having fun, what's the problem?"
303793,L664705,u8997,m613,SKY,"You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore."
303794,L664704,u9000,m613,XANDER,I can see that. Why?
303795,L664703,u8997,m613,SKY,"I'm through, Xander."
303796,L664702,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation..."
303797,L665201,u8998,m613,SLOVO,They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
303798,L665200,u9000,m613,XANDER,Why you dogging me up?
303799,L665199,u8998,m613,SLOVO,"Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?"
303800,L665198,u9000,m613,XANDER,What's the deal?
303801,L665197,u8998,m613,SLOVO,"Sorry, ""dude""."
303802,L665195,u8998,m613,SLOVO,Is this what you're looking for?
303803,L665194,u9000,m613,XANDER,I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
303804,L665193,u8998,m613,SLOVO,"You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?"
303805,L665192,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Dude, what are you doing here?"
303806,L664970,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Yeah, thanks a lot."
303807,L664969,u8998,m613,SLOVO,I'll leave you two alone to talk.
303808,L664903,u8998,m613,SLOVO,The corner. Anarchy 99.
303809,L664902,u9000,m613,XANDER,Nice hops.
303810,L664900,u9000,m613,XANDER,"First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest."
303811,L664899,u8998,m613,SLOVO,"You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our."
303812,L664898,u9000,m613,XANDER,Here we go again.
303813,L664897,u8998,m613,SLOVO,"My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you."
303814,L664896,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand."
303815,L664895,u8998,m613,SLOVO,Sit down.
303816,L664824,u9000,m613,XANDER,Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
303817,L664823,u8999,m613,VIRG,They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
303818,L664818,u8999,m613,VIRG,"It's like you said, every man for himself."
303819,L664817,u9000,m613,XANDER,Help me with this guy.
303820,L664803,u8999,m613,VIRG,"He's a pretty good actor, though."
303821,L664802,u9000,m613,XANDER,Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
303822,L664780,u9000,m613,XANDER,A parachute. This does not argue well.
303823,L664779,u8999,m613,VIRG,"Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?"
303824,L664775,u9000,m613,XANDER,Been to any good diners lately?
303825,L664774,u8999,m613,VIRG,What's so damn funny?
303826,L665272,u9000,m613,XANDER,Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
303827,L665271,u9001,m613,YORGI,"You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --"
303828,L665268,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it."
303829,L665267,u9000,m613,XANDER,"And here I thought ""anarchy"" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt."
303830,L665266,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it."
303831,L665265,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Including rape, pillage, murder."
303832,L665264,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want."
303833,L665263,u9000,m613,XANDER,"So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world."
303834,L665262,u9001,m613,YORGI,"You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves."
303835,L665261,u9000,m613,XANDER,"What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche."
303836,L665258,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is."
303837,L665257,u9000,m613,XANDER,I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
303838,L665256,u9001,m613,YORGI,"And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?"
303839,L665250,u9000,m613,XANDER,Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
303840,L665249,u9001,m613,YORGI,That was for Anders.
303841,L665067,u9001,m613,YORGI,You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
303842,L665066,u9000,m613,XANDER,"That's alright, I'm kinda tired."
303843,L665065,u9001,m613,YORGI,"I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl."
303844,L665059,u9000,m613,XANDER,"My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch."
303845,L665058,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere."
303846,L665057,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen."
303847,L665056,u9001,m613,YORGI,"You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?"
303848,L665055,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg."
303849,L665054,u9001,m613,YORGI,"It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me."
303850,L665053,u9000,m613,XANDER,You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
303851,L665033,u9001,m613,YORGI,Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
303852,L665032,u9000,m613,XANDER,How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
303853,L665031,u9001,m613,YORGI,"You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man."
303854,L665030,u9000,m613,XANDER,"""...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese"". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals."
303855,L665029,u9001,m613,YORGI,"To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: ""America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."""
303856,L665028,u9001,m613,YORGI,"That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born."
303857,L665027,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money."
303858,L665026,u9000,m613,XANDER,You wanna see my politics?
303859,L665025,u9001,m613,YORGI,"It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours."
303860,L665024,u9000,m613,XANDER,"What's ""Anarchy 99""?"
303861,L665023,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!"
303862,L665020,u9000,m613,XANDER,Had to do what I had to do.
303863,L665019,u9001,m613,YORGI,I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
303864,L665014,u9000,m613,XANDER,Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
303865,L665013,u9001,m613,YORGI,"He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you."
303866,L665012,u9000,m613,XANDER,You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
303867,L665011,u9001,m613,YORGI,"What's going on, my friend?"
303868,L665004,u9001,m613,YORGI,This is a gift. From me to you.
303869,L665003,u9000,m613,XANDER,What's this?
303870,L665002,u9001,m613,YORGI,Of course.
303871,L665001,u9000,m613,XANDER,I had to inspect the merchandise first.
303872,L665000,u9001,m613,YORGI,I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
303873,L664999,u9000,m613,XANDER,Very nice. I'm impressed.
303874,L664940,u9000,m613,XANDER,It'll work faster if I have an account number.
303875,L664939,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details."
303876,L664930,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start."
303877,L664929,u9001,m613,YORGI,We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
303878,L664926,u9000,m613,XANDER,When else are you gonna do it?
303879,L664925,u9001,m613,YORGI,I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
303880,L664919,u9000,m613,XANDER,"I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?"
303881,L664918,u9001,m613,YORGI,"Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about."
303882,L664917,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them."
303883,L664916,u9001,m613,YORGI,"I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house."
303884,L664915,u9000,m613,XANDER,He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
303885,L664914,u9001,m613,YORGI,Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
303886,L664910,u9000,m613,XANDER,"Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?"
303887,L664909,u9001,m613,YORGI,This pizda? Never seen him before.
303888,L664908,u9000,m613,XANDER,That's the guy.
303889,L664564,u9009,m614,STORM,Beast.
303890,L664563,u9002,m614,BEAST,"Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--"
303891,L664562,u9009,m614,STORM,We all do.
303892,L664561,u9002,m614,BEAST,I wish I could go.
303893,L664555,u9009,m614,STORM,... until he found tungsten.
303894,L664554,u9002,m614,BEAST,Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
303895,L664509,u9002,m614,BEAST,"The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions."
303896,L664508,u9009,m614,STORM,What does that mean?
303897,L664559,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
303898,L664558,u9002,m614,BEAST,Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
303899,L664557,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,For what purpose?
303900,L664556,u9002,m614,BEAST,"Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration."
303901,L664553,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,Its core?
303902,L664552,u9002,m614,BEAST,It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
303903,L664511,u9002,m614,BEAST,"I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro."
303904,L664510,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,Can the Professor repair his own mind?
303905,L664610,u9004,m614,JEAN,I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
303906,L664609,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,Jean... can you?
303907,L664595,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,"Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here."
303908,L664594,u9004,m614,JEAN,It's too far.
303909,L664593,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,"I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?"
303910,L664575,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,Uh-huh.
303911,L664574,u9004,m614,JEAN,Into the Hudson?
303912,L664573,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,"Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down."
303913,L664570,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,"He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him."
303914,L664569,u9004,m614,JEAN,What's that?
303915,L664568,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,I'll tell you one thing though.
303916,L664567,u9004,m614,JEAN,"Well, I think that's perfectly understandable."
303917,L664566,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
303918,L664515,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
303919,L664514,u9004,m614,JEAN,Are you all right?
303920,L664513,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,We have to find Magneto.
303921,L664512,u9004,m614,JEAN,"He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid."
303922,L664503,u9004,m614,JEAN,His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
303923,L664502,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,What's wrong with him?
303924,L664396,u9004,m614,JEAN,If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
303925,L664395,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,"You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake."
303926,L664394,u9004,m614,JEAN,What are you talking about?
303927,L664393,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,I don't like him being here.
303928,L664392,u9004,m614,JEAN,Scott.. I -
303929,L664642,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,"Sure you are, sport."
303930,L664641,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
303931,L664427,u9006,m614,LOGAN,"Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men."
303932,L664426,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,"You know, you --"
303933,L664425,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
303934,L664423,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
303935,L664422,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,How long have you been in Alaska?
303936,L664419,u9003,m614,CYCLOPS,I wanted to talk to you.
303937,L664418,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
303938,L664482,u9004,m614,JEAN,"Yeah, I'll bet you have."
303939,L664481,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I've seen a lot of rings.
303940,L664480,u9004,m614,JEAN,"Logan, do you see this ring?"
303941,L664478,u9004,m614,JEAN,What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
303942,L664477,u9006,m614,LOGAN,He takes himself seriously.
303943,L664476,u9004,m614,JEAN,He takes his work seriously.
303944,L664475,u9006,m614,LOGAN,He's uptight.
303945,L664474,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Suit yourself.
303946,L664473,u9004,m614,JEAN,Let go.
303947,L664472,u9004,m614,JEAN,Not interested.
303948,L664471,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What do you say?
303949,L664470,u9004,m614,JEAN,Were you now?
303950,L664469,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
303951,L664468,u9004,m614,JEAN,He's busy right now.
303952,L664467,u9006,m614,LOGAN,You should always work with a spotter.
303953,L664390,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What if they're naughty?
303954,L664389,u9004,m614,JEAN,If necessary.
303955,L664388,u9006,m614,LOGAN,By reading my thoughts?
303956,L664387,u9004,m614,JEAN,"Maybe, the Professor could help you with that."
303957,L664386,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
303958,L664385,u9004,m614,JEAN,"The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary."
303959,L664384,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What if I like the pain?
303960,L664383,u9004,m614,JEAN,"I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while."
303961,L664382,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I won't light the cigars - how about that?
303962,L664381,u9004,m614,JEAN,There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
303963,L664380,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Some cigars.  Case of beer.
303964,L664379,u9004,m614,JEAN,Anything else I can get you?
303965,L664537,u9005,m614,KELLY,"I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes."
303966,L664536,u9004,m614,JEAN,The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
303967,L664526,u9005,m614,KELLY,Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
303968,L664525,u9004,m614,JEAN,Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
303969,L664524,u9005,m614,KELLY,"I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would..."
303970,L664519,u9004,m614,JEAN,Senator?
303971,L664518,u9005,m614,KELLY,Dr. Grey.
303972,L664268,u9005,m614,KELLY,"I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes."
303973,L664267,u9004,m614,JEAN,"I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator."
303974,L664266,u9005,m614,KELLY,"This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -"
303975,L664265,u9004,m614,JEAN,"Control, Senator...  we teach them control."
303976,L664264,u9005,m614,KELLY,You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
303977,L664263,u9004,m614,JEAN,Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
303978,L664262,u9005,m614,KELLY,"Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?"
303979,L664259,u9004,m614,JEAN,"I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous."
303980,L664258,u9005,m614,KELLY,"You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?"
303981,L664319,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"Let's just say, God works too slowly."
303982,L664318,u9005,m614,KELLY,What is it you intend to do to me?
303983,L664317,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth."
303984,L664316,u9005,m614,KELLY,The intention of registration act -
303985,L664312,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"Gosh, I hope so."
303986,L664311,u9005,m614,KELLY,Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
303987,L664310,u9005,m614,KELLY,You mutant bastards...
303988,L664309,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
303989,L664308,u9005,m614,KELLY,You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
303990,L664580,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?"
303991,L664579,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What are you going to do?
303992,L664578,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,You're backstage at the encore of creation.
303993,L664577,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Where am I?
303994,L664497,u9006,m614,LOGAN,You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
303995,L664496,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,Come with me and I'll let her live.
303996,L664495,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What do you want?
303997,L664494,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,I do love a good check mate.
303998,L664654,u9006,m614,LOGAN,"What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here."
303999,L664653,u9010,m614,XAVIER,"Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will..."
304000,L664652,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
304001,L664651,u9010,m614,XAVIER,They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
304002,L664650,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Don't you knock?
304003,L664450,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I'll go.
304004,L664449,u9010,m614,XAVIER,"I've found her, Westchester Mall."
304005,L664447,u9010,m614,XAVIER,We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
304006,L664446,u9006,m614,LOGAN,He helped you?
304007,L664445,u9010,m614,XAVIER,"Actually, Magneto helped me put it together."
304008,L664444,u9006,m614,LOGAN,You designed this yourself?
304009,L664443,u9010,m614,XAVIER,The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
304010,L664442,u9006,m614,LOGAN,How?
304011,L664441,u9010,m614,XAVIER,To find Rogue.
304012,L664440,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Where are we going?
304013,L664436,u9010,m614,XAVIER,I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
304014,L664435,u9006,m614,LOGAN,No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
304015,L664434,u9010,m614,XAVIER,Now that's Magneto talking.
304016,L664433,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
304017,L664432,u9010,m614,XAVIER,The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
304018,L664431,u9006,m614,LOGAN,"This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of ""team"" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?"
304019,L664430,u9010,m614,XAVIER,The point of what?
304020,L664371,u9010,m614,XAVIER,Deal.
304021,L664370,u9006,m614,LOGAN,"Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you."
304022,L664303,u9010,m614,XAVIER,"A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay."
304023,L664302,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Who?
304024,L664301,u9010,m614,XAVIER,I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
304025,L664300,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What am I doing here?
304026,L664416,u9006,m614,LOGAN,And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
304027,L664415,u9009,m614,STORM,If she held on any longer she could have.
304028,L664414,u9006,m614,LOGAN,I felt like she almost killed me.
304029,L664413,u9009,m614,STORM,"She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered."
304030,L664412,u9006,m614,LOGAN,What did she do to me?
304031,L664411,u9009,m614,STORM,"The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours."
304032,L664410,u9006,m614,LOGAN,Why is everybody up at sunrise?
304033,L664378,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,ALIVE.
304034,L664377,u9008,m614,SABRETOOTH,I'll find him.
304035,L664286,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,Enough for a test.
304036,L664285,u9008,m614,SABRETOOTH,Is it enough?
304037,L664284,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,A piece.  Only a piece.
304038,L664283,u9008,m614,SABRETOOTH,Is that what you're looking for?
304039,L664278,u9008,m614,SABRETOOTH,It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
304040,L664277,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,How?
304041,L664276,u9008,m614,SABRETOOTH,I lost him.
304042,L664665,u9010,m614,XAVIER,I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
304043,L664664,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,And what do you do when you wake up to that?
304044,L664663,u9010,m614,XAVIER,"It does indeed, Max."
304045,L664662,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?"
304046,L664661,u9010,m614,XAVIER,I know.
304047,L664660,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed..."
304048,L664365,u9010,m614,XAVIER,WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
304049,L664364,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
304050,L664363,u9010,m614,XAVIER,What do you mean to do?
304051,L664362,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat."
304052,L664361,u9010,m614,XAVIER,The way what is going to be?
304053,L664360,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
304054,L664355,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me."
304055,L664354,u9010,m614,XAVIER,"You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?"
304056,L664353,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
304057,L664352,u9010,m614,XAVIER,Is that so?
304058,L664350,u9010,m614,XAVIER,What do you want with him?
304059,L664349,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
304060,L664346,u9010,m614,XAVIER,"Not at the cost of lives, Max."
304061,L664345,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same."
304062,L664344,u9010,m614,XAVIER,And I'll never understand terrorists.
304063,L664343,u9007,m614,MAGNETO,"I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles."
304064,L665374,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
304065,L665373,u9011,m615,ANASTASIA,"Oh, shit."
304066,L665372,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
304067,L665371,u9011,m615,ANASTASIA,And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
304068,L665370,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,"Yes, my dear, he is."
304069,L665369,u9011,m615,ANASTASIA,"Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?"
304070,L666093,u9012,m615,BURGOMEISTER,Now wait a minute!
304071,L666092,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
304072,L666088,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Poppycock!
304073,L666087,u9012,m615,BURGOMEISTER,"They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?"
304074,L666086,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Ugly, vicious rumous."
304075,L666085,u9012,m615,BURGOMEISTER,"Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?"
304076,L666084,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Victor Frankenstein.
304077,L666083,u9012,m615,BURGOMEISTER,What was your grandfather's name?
304078,L666082,u9017,m615,FREDDY,No!
304079,L666081,u9012,m615,BURGOMEISTER,The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
304080,L666080,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
304081,L666079,u9012,m615,BURGOMEISTER,And who might you be?
304082,L666078,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You have the wrong house.
304083,L666077,u9012,m615,BURGOMEISTER,Frederick Frankenstein?
304084,L665456,u9017,m615,FREDDY,... No!
304085,L665455,u9013,m615,CARLSON,"Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?"
304086,L665454,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant."
304087,L665453,u9013,m615,CARLSON,"Yes, sir?"
304088,L665452,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Carlson!
304089,L665435,u9017,m615,FREDDY,He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
304090,L665434,u9013,m615,CARLSON,"Yes, sir."
304091,L665424,u9013,m615,CARLSON,"Yes, sir."
304092,L665423,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Give him an extra dollar.
304093,L665406,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
304094,L665405,u9013,m615,CARLSON,"No, sir.  It will never happen again."
304095,L665404,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
304096,L665403,u9013,m615,CARLSON,"Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up."
304097,L665402,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
304098,L665401,u9013,m615,CARLSON,"From your office, sir."
304099,L665400,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Where did you get this cauliflower?
304100,L665379,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,"I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!"
304101,L665378,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"Yes, sir."
304102,L665377,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
304103,L665368,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
304104,L665367,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
304105,L665366,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University."
304106,L665365,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
304107,L665364,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come."
304108,L665363,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"I did, sir."
304109,L665362,u9014,m615,CORNELIUS WALDMAN,Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
304110,L666203,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMmmm.
304111,L666202,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
304112,L666201,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMmmm.
304113,L666200,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Love me oodles and oodles?
304114,L666199,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMmmm.
304115,L666198,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Still happy you married me?
304116,L666197,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMmmm.
304117,L666196,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
304118,L666130,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
304119,L666129,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMMMM!  MMMMM!
304120,L666128,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Is it that music?
304121,L666127,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMMmm!
304122,L666125,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
304123,L666124,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMMmmmm.
304124,L666123,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
304125,L666119,u9023,m615,MONSTER,Baack!
304126,L666118,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,What?
304127,L666117,u9023,m615,MONSTER,Baack!
304128,L666116,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,What in God's name are you doing?
304129,L665976,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,I...
304130,L665975,u9019,m615,IGOR,Miss me?
304131,L665974,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Well... yes.
304132,L665973,u9019,m615,IGOR,Surprised?
304133,L665972,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Hello...?
304134,L665971,u9019,m615,IGOR,Darling!
304135,L666017,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,That's my good boy.
304136,L666016,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Good night.
304137,L666015,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
304138,L666014,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I suppose you're right.
304139,L666013,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Is it worth taking a chance?
304140,L666012,u9017,m615,FREDDY,That's a tough choice.
304141,L666011,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??"
304142,L666010,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
304143,L666009,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything."
304144,L666008,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you."
304145,L666007,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
304146,L666005,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
304147,L666004,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I suppose you're right.
304148,L666003,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest."
304149,L666002,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?"
304150,L666001,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling."
304151,L666000,u9017,m615,FREDDY,But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
304152,L665999,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"Darling, you mustn't worry so."
304153,L665998,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
304154,L665986,u9017,m615,FREDDY,All right then!
304155,L665985,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"No, of course not.  I just meant..."
304156,L665984,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Are you suggesting I call him master???
304157,L665983,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Why does he call you 'master'?
304158,L665982,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though."
304159,L665981,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,What a strange fellow.
304160,L665979,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?"
304161,L665978,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all."
304162,L665977,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Ready, darling?"
304163,L665968,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor."
304164,L665967,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Darling!?!
304165,L665966,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?"
304166,L665965,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Love me?
304167,L665964,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Surprised!
304168,L665963,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Surprised?
304169,L665962,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Darling!
304170,L665961,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Darling!
304171,L665523,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Goodbye, darling!"
304172,L665522,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"Goodbye, darling."
304173,L665521,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"Goodbye, darling."
304174,L665520,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"I will!  Goodbye, darling!"
304175,L665515,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You bet your boots it does.
304176,L665514,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Does that mean you love me?
304177,L665513,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You're incorrigible!
304178,L665512,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
304179,L665511,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Whatever makes you happy.
304180,L665510,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,I hope you like large weddings.
304181,L665509,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Oh, nice."
304182,L665508,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
304183,L665507,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Very....very!
304184,L665506,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Will you miss me?
304185,L665503,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Oh, darling -- so will I."
304186,L665502,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,"Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away."
304187,L665501,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I promise.
304188,L665500,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Promise??
304189,L665499,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Yes.
304190,L665498,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Call me from New York before you leave??
304191,L665497,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Yes, don't worry."
304192,L665496,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,And your passport?
304193,L665495,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Yes.
304194,L665494,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,You have your tickets?
304195,L665493,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Of course.
304196,L665492,u9015,m615,ELIZABETH,Darling!...you will be careful!?
304197,L665956,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight."
304198,L665955,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
304199,L665954,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?"
304200,L665614,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Good.
304201,L665613,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,"I put her in the guest room, just down the hall."
304202,L665612,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
304203,L665611,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,Will there be anything else?
304204,L665610,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Well... we'll see.
304205,L665609,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,"I think you must be mistaken, sir."
304206,L665608,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
304207,L665607,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,This is the only library I know of.
304208,L665606,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study."
304209,L665605,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,"I don't know what you mean, sir."
304210,L665604,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
304211,L665603,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,"Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library."
304212,L665602,u9017,m615,FREDDY,There seem to be quite a few books.
304213,L665600,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"May I have it, please?"
304214,L665599,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
304215,L665598,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Yes!... the laboratory.
304216,L665597,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,You mean... the laboratory??
304217,L665596,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Does that include the key to the laboratory?
304218,L665595,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
304219,L665594,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It seems fine.
304220,L665593,u9016,m615,FRAU BLUCHER,I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
304221,L665491,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!"
304222,L665490,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
304223,L665489,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor."
304224,L665488,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Well, thank you very much for all your trouble."
304225,L665487,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"One week -- I'll see to it, sir."
304226,L665486,u9017,m615,FREDDY,One week at the most!?
304227,L665485,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"Yes, sir."
304228,L665484,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?"
304229,L665482,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
304230,L665481,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I didn't do that.
304231,L665480,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,Break that old man's violin.
304232,L665479,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What?
304233,L665478,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,Why did you do that?
304234,L665477,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
304235,L665466,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
304236,L665465,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,A week.  Ten days at most.
304237,L665464,u9017,m615,FREDDY,How long will this whole thing take?
304238,L665463,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?"
304239,L665462,u9017,m615,FREDDY,But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
304240,L665461,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,"Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune."
304241,L665459,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
304242,L665458,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Fron kon steen!
304243,L665457,u9018,m615,HERR FALKSTEIN,Dr. Frankenstein?
304244,L665450,u9017,m615,FREDDY,My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
304245,L665449,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,"But your grandfather's work, sir..."
304246,L665448,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,"
304247,L665447,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
304248,L665446,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,"But, sir..."
304249,L665445,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
304250,L665444,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
304251,L665443,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead."
304252,L665442,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,"Nineteen, sir."
304253,L665441,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"How old are you, young man?"
304254,L665440,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,"Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?"
304255,L665439,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
304256,L665438,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,"But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?"
304257,L665437,u9017,m615,FREDDY,My father was a sick man.
304258,L665436,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,"But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?"
304259,L665431,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti."
304260,L665430,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,Vermicelli.
304261,L665429,u9017,m615,FREDDY,A piece of what?
304262,L665428,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,"Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?"
304263,L665427,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Yes?
304264,L665426,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,Dr. Fronkonsteen!
304265,L665425,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?"
304266,L665394,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
304267,L665393,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
304268,L665392,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions."
304269,L665391,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!"
304270,L665390,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
304271,L665389,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!"
304272,L665388,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
304273,L665387,u9017,m615,FREDDY,My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
304274,L665386,u9022,m615,MEDICAL STUDENT,I beg your pardon?
304275,L665385,u9017,m615,FREDDY,That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
304276,L666138,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing."
304277,L666137,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It's the only way.
304278,L666136,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?"
304279,L666135,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Is everything ready?
304280,L666134,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Come on, big fellow!"
304281,L666104,u9019,m615,IGOR,I'll bet it's a doozy.
304282,L666103,u9017,m615,FREDDY,There's only one way.
304283,L666102,u9019,m615,IGOR,"I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?"
304284,L666101,u9017,m615,FREDDY,... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
304285,L666100,u9019,m615,IGOR,"That sound good, boss."
304286,L666099,u9017,m615,FREDDY,No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
304287,L666096,u9019,m615,IGOR,He's carrying her off now through the woods.
304288,L666095,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What???
304289,L666094,u9019,m615,IGOR,"You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee."
304290,L666091,u9019,m615,IGOR,"What d'ya mean ""What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement."
304291,L666090,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What monster?
304292,L665948,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Come on, Froderick -- none of that."
304293,L665947,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I'm a failure.
304294,L665907,u9019,m615,IGOR,That's what we're paid for.
304295,L665906,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Thanks...for all your help.
304296,L665884,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Maybe...if you get here on time.
304297,L665883,u9019,m615,IGOR,Can you play it?
304298,L665882,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
304299,L665881,u9019,m615,IGOR,How do you know it was a 'she'?
304300,L665880,u9017,m615,FREDDY,All right -- where is she?
304301,L665879,u9019,m615,IGOR,How do you know it was a 'he'?
304302,L665878,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Where is he?
304303,L665877,u9019,m615,IGOR,Someone was playing this in the music room.
304304,L665876,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What did you find out?
304305,L665875,u9019,m615,IGOR,How's it going?
304306,L665855,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Act casual!
304307,L665854,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Yes, Master!"
304308,L665853,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
304309,L665852,u9019,m615,IGOR,It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
304310,L665835,u9017,m615,FREDDY,... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
304311,L665834,u9019,m615,IGOR,"No, no!  That whole thing!"
304312,L665833,u9017,m615,FREDDY,... I'm glad that's...
304313,L665832,u9019,m615,IGOR,Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
304314,L665831,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I'm not trying to be funny.
304315,L665830,u9019,m615,IGOR,What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
304316,L665829,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Why?
304317,L665828,u9019,m615,IGOR,You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
304318,L665827,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Yes.
304319,L665826,u9019,m615,IGOR,You can say that again.
304320,L665825,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
304321,L665824,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Give -- me -- your -- hand!
304322,L665823,u9019,m615,IGOR,Original.
304323,L665810,u9019,m615,IGOR,"careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps."
304324,L665809,u9017,m615,FREDDY,But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
304325,L665808,u9019,m615,IGOR,Don't fall for that one.
304326,L665807,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
304327,L665806,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case."
304328,L665805,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you."
304329,L665797,u9019,m615,IGOR,It wasn't me.
304330,L665796,u9017,m615,FREDDY,But you did -- I just heard it.
304331,L665795,u9019,m615,IGOR,I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
304332,L665794,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert."
304333,L665793,u9019,m615,IGOR,Who are you talking to?
304334,L665792,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent."
304335,L665789,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
304336,L665788,u9019,m615,IGOR,"I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way."
304337,L665787,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down."
304338,L665786,u9019,m615,IGOR,You'll be getting me sad next.
304339,L665785,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Well, I don't like to see you mope."
304340,L665784,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Don't try to cheer me up that way.
304341,L665783,u9019,m615,IGOR,You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
304342,L665782,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Cold!  Cold and dead!
304343,L665779,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"But there must be a reason. This is science, not art."
304344,L665778,u9019,m615,IGOR,You can't win 'em all.
304345,L665772,u9019,m615,IGOR,Wait till he sees the bill.
304346,L665771,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Throw the third switch!
304347,L665770,u9019,m615,IGOR,What?
304348,L665769,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"More, do you hear me?"
304349,L665768,u9019,m615,IGOR,What?
304350,L665767,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?"
304351,L665766,u9019,m615,IGOR,This guy means business.
304352,L665765,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Throw the second switch!
304353,L665761,u9019,m615,IGOR,"You've got it, master."
304354,L665760,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
304355,L665759,u9019,m615,IGOR,Tonight?
304356,L665758,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows."
304357,L665754,u9017,m615,FREDDY,All right... elevate me!
304358,L665753,u9019,m615,IGOR,You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
304359,L665747,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios."
304360,L665746,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
304361,L665745,u9019,m615,IGOR,You're sure you know what you're doing?
304362,L665736,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Thank you, Master."
304363,L665735,u9017,m615,FREDDY,If you like -- just hurry!
304364,L665734,u9019,m615,IGOR,It's always been one of my favorite names.
304365,L665733,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Why?
304366,L665732,u9019,m615,IGOR,Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
304367,L665731,u9017,m615,FREDDY,He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
304368,L665730,u9019,m615,IGOR,I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
304369,L665729,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Can you imagine that brain in this body?
304370,L665728,u9019,m615,IGOR,That's not bad.
304371,L665727,u9017,m615,FREDDY,And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
304372,L665726,u9019,m615,IGOR,Hmm!
304373,L665725,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century."
304374,L665724,u9019,m615,IGOR,Was he any good?
304375,L665723,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I want that brain.
304376,L665722,u9019,m615,IGOR,Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
304377,L665721,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Do you have the name I wrote down?
304378,L665720,u9019,m615,IGOR,I have a pretty good idea.
304379,L665719,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!"
304380,L665714,u9019,m615,IGOR,Could be raining!
304381,L665713,u9017,m615,FREDDY,How?
304382,L665712,u9019,m615,IGOR,Could be worse!
304383,L665711,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What a filthy job!
304384,L665679,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh."
304385,L665678,u9019,m615,IGOR,Taking the book along?
304386,L665674,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
304387,L665673,u9019,m615,IGOR,'How I Did It.'  Good title!
304388,L665672,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
304389,L665669,u9019,m615,IGOR,Must be the music room.
304390,L665668,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What is this place?
304391,L665662,u9019,m615,IGOR,"No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door."
304392,L665661,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Did you see anyone else down here?
304393,L665656,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first."
304394,L665655,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
304395,L665654,u9019,m615,IGOR,What?
304396,L665653,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
304397,L665650,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Did you hear that strange music?
304398,L665649,u9019,m615,IGOR,What?
304399,L665648,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Did you hear that strange music??
304400,L665647,u9019,m615,IGOR,What?
304401,L665646,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Did you hear that strange music?
304402,L665645,u9019,m615,IGOR,Just putting up some tea.
304403,L665644,u9017,m615,FREDDY,But what you were doing?
304404,L665643,u9019,m615,IGOR,"I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here."
304405,L665642,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What are you doing here?
304406,L665641,u9019,m615,IGOR,Fro-derick!
304407,L665640,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Aye-gor!
304408,L665585,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I wonder what's got into them?
304409,L665584,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Down!  Get down, you beasts!"
304410,L665580,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Home.
304411,L665579,u9019,m615,IGOR,Home!
304412,L665577,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers."
304413,L665576,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Wockers with the knockers???
304414,L665575,u9019,m615,IGOR,The wockers with the knockers.
304415,L665574,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What wockers?
304416,L665573,u9019,m615,IGOR,Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
304417,L665572,u9017,m615,FREDDY,No.
304418,L665571,u9019,m615,IGOR,I thought you wanted to.
304419,L665570,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Why are you talking like that?
304420,L665569,u9019,m615,IGOR,There wolf!  There castle!
304421,L665568,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I beg your pardon?
304422,L665567,u9019,m615,IGOR,There.
304423,L665562,u9019,m615,IGOR,What hump?
304424,L665561,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump."
304425,L665551,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Yes, just the two."
304426,L665550,u9019,m615,IGOR,Are these your bags?
304427,L665547,u9017,m615,FREDDY,How do you do?
304428,L665546,u9019,m615,IGOR,This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
304429,L665545,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I'm sure we will.
304430,L665544,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs."
304431,L665543,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?"
304432,L665542,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?"
304433,L665541,u9017,m615,FREDDY,But they told me it was Ee gor.
304434,L665540,u9019,m615,IGOR,"No, it's pronounced Aye gor."
304435,L665539,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You must be Igor.
304436,L665538,u9019,m615,IGOR,I see.
304437,L665537,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
304438,L665536,u9019,m615,IGOR,Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
304439,L665535,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"No, Fred ereck."
304440,L665534,u9019,m615,IGOR,And do you also say Fro dereck?
304441,L665533,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen."
304442,L665532,u9019,m615,IGOR,Are you putting me on?
304443,L665531,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Fron kon steen!
304444,L665530,u9019,m615,IGOR,Frederick Frankenstein?
304445,L665945,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
304446,L665944,u9023,m615,MONSTER,MMMmmmmmm.
304447,L665943,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??"

304474,L665472,u9024,m615,OLD VIOLINIST,"It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?"
304475,L665471,u9017,m615,FREDDY,May I see your violin?
304476,L665470,u9017,m615,FREDDY,How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
304477,L665469,u9024,m615,OLD VIOLINIST,Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
304478,L665468,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What's that tune that you're playing

304490,L666076,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!"
304491,L666075,u9020,m615,INGA,"Yes, I will."
304492,L666074,u9017,m615,FREDDY,You've got to help me to remain faithful.

304506,L666034,u9020,m615,INGA,Nor to Elizabeth.
304507,L666033,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me."
304508,L666032,u9020,m615,INGA,What?
304509,L666030,u9020,m615,INGA,Of course not.
304510,L666029,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
304511,L666028,u9020,m615,INGA,I know Frederick.
304512,L666027,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear."
304513,L666026,u9020,m615,INGA,I see what you mean.
304514,L666025,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?"
304515,L666024,u9020,m615,INGA,Not fooling around.
304516,L666023,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
304517,L666022,u9020,m615,INGA,"I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor."
304518,L666021,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you."
304519,L666020,u9020,m615,INGA,"What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely."
304520,L666019,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Just passing through the night.
304521,L665958,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!"
304522,L665957,u9020,m615,INGA,"Why, doctor...how wonderful for you."
304523,L665905,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Good night!
304524,L665904,u9020,m615,INGA,"Good night, Doctor."
304525,L665898,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
304526,L665897,u9020,m615,INGA,I think so.
304527,L665896,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Did you do it?
304528,L665894,u9020,m615,INGA,"Oh!  Yes, Doctor."
304529,L665893,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Give him the sedative!
304530,L665892,u9020,m615,INGA,Are you serious??
304531,L665891,u9017,m615,FREDDY,All right -- give it to him!
304532,L665874,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Stop -- singing!!!
304533,L665873,u9020,m615,INGA,"It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'"
304534,L665870,u9020,m615,INGA,"It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'"
304535,L665869,u9017,m615,FREDDY,This is not the finals -- just sing!
304536,L665868,u9020,m615,INGA,I'd be so nervous.
304537,L665867,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Yes -- quickly, dear!"
304538,L665866,u9020,m615,INGA,Me?  Sing?
304539,L665865,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Do you think you can sing it?
304540,L665862,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I think I'll...carry him.
304541,L665861,u9020,m615,INGA,What are you going to do?
304542,L665841,u9020,m615,INGA,What do you think we should do?
304543,L665840,u9017,m615,FREDDY,It looks that way.
304544,L665804,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
304545,L665803,u9020,m615,INGA,"I think you've done it, master."
304546,L665802,u9020,m615,INGA,"Oh, Doctor!"
304547,L665799,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me..."
304548,L665798,u9020,m615,INGA,It wasn't me.
304549,L665777,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
304550,L665776,u9020,m615,INGA,I thought it was wonderful.
304551,L665775,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Reputation.  Reputation!
304552,L665757,u9020,m615,INGA,"Oh!  Yes, Doctor."
304553,L665756,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Raise the platform, hurry!"
304554,L665755,u9020,m615,INGA,Right here?
304555,L665752,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I know.
304556,L665751,u9020,m615,INGA,Yes!
304557,L665750,u9017,m615,FREDDY,A god?
304558,L665749,u9020,m615,INGA,"Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a..."
304559,L665748,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine."
304560,L665693,u9017,m615,FREDDY,'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
304561,L665692,u9020,m615,INGA,"And look at this, Doctor!"
304562,L665691,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything."
304563,L665677,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Perhaps we'd better leave.
304564,L665676,u9020,m615,INGA,"Oh, doctor!"
304565,L665665,u9020,m615,INGA,But who was playing it?
304566,L665664,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Well, this explains the music."
304567,L665663,u9020,m615,INGA,"Look, Doctor!"
304568,L665659,u9017,m615,FREDDY,What a filthy mess.
304569,L665658,u9020,m615,INGA,Ooh!
304570,L665639,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!"
304571,L665638,u9020,m615,INGA,"Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone."
304572,L665637,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see."
304573,L665636,u9020,m615,INGA,Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
304574,L665633,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I don't know.  It just woke me up.
304575,L665632,u9020,m615,INGA,Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
304576,L665631,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
304577,L665630,u9020,m615,INGA,"What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?"
304578,L665629,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Inga, wake up!"
304579,L665628,u9020,m615,INGA,"Yes, you may... but don't make any noise."
304580,L665627,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Inga!
304581,L665625,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
304582,L665624,u9020,m615,INGA,"No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep."
304583,L665623,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Would you like a sandwich?
304584,L665622,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while."
304585,L665621,u9020,m615,INGA,Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
304586,L665620,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Well...
304587,L665619,u9020,m615,INGA,"I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room."
304588,L665618,u9017,m615,FREDDY,We only arrived a few minutes ago.
304589,L665617,u9020,m615,INGA,Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
304590,L665616,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?"
304591,L665615,u9020,m615,INGA,Are you busy?
304592,L665565,u9017,m615,FREDDY,Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
304593,L665564,u9020,m615,INGA,Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
304594,L665559,u9017,m615,FREDDY,I'm not sure I...get your drift.
304595,L665558,u9020,m615,INGA,Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
304596,L665553,u9017,m615,FREDDY,"Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad."
304597,L665552,u9020,m615,INGA,Did you have a pleasant trip?
304598,L665549,u9017,m615,FREDDY,How nice.
304599,L665548,u9020,m615,INGA,Extremely well.
304600,L666169,u9020,m615,INGA,Do Something!  Stall them!
304601,L666168,u9019,m615,IGOR,Another fifteen seconds to go.
304602,L666167,u9020,m615,INGA,Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
304603,L666166,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty."
304604,L666161,u9019,m615,IGOR,Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
304605,L666160,u9020,m615,INGA,
304606,L666159,u9019,m615,IGOR,Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
304607,L666158,u9020,m615,INGA,Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
304608,L666156,u9020,m615,INGA,"Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well."
304609,L666155,u9019,m615,IGOR,What d'ya want to do to kill time?
304610,L666154,u9020,m615,INGA,Yes.
304611,L666153,u9019,m615,IGOR,Three minutes to go!
304612,L666152,u9020,m615,INGA,Four
304613,L666151,u9019,m615,IGOR,How long is it so far?
304614,L666150,u9020,m615,INGA,The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
304615,L666149,u9019,m615,IGOR,How do you know they're done?
304616,L665952,u9019,m615,IGOR,"Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?"
304617,L665951,u9020,m615,INGA,"I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?"
304618,L665950,u9019,m615,IGOR,You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
304619,L665949,u9020,m615,INGA,Look how far we've come.
304620,L665901,u9019,m615,IGOR,Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
304621,L665900,u9020,m615,INGA,I'm getting tired.
304622,L665886,u9019,m615,IGOR,Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
304623,L665885,u9020,m615,INGA,"It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully."
304624,L665696,u9019,m615,IGOR,Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
304625,L665695,u9020,m615,INGA,His schwanzstucker.
304626,L665694,u9019,m615,IGOR,His what??
304627,L665652,u9020,m615,INGA,There must have been someone else down here then.
304628,L665651,u9019,m615,IGOR,"No, not sound."

304641,L666462,u9026,m616,BOY-PULLEN,Why don 't the Zulus attack?
304642,L666368,u9025,m616,BLOOMFIELD,"One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!"

304652,L666503,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,"What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?"
304653,L666398,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
304654,L666397,u9032,m616,NORRIS-NEWMAN,So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
304655,L666396,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
304656,L666395,u9032,m616,NORRIS-NEWMAN,"If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but ""why?"" is the question my readers will ask. ""why?"""
304657,L666394,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,"Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right"
304658,L666393,u9032,m616,NORRIS-NEWMAN,"They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord."
304659,L666392,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
304660,L666391,u9032,m616,NORRIS-NEWMAN,"Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross."
304661,L666390,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir

304666,L666484,u9030,m616,DURNFORD,I'm explaining my reasons.
304667,L666483,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,"Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?"
304668,L666482,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
304669,L666481,u9030,m616,DURNFORD,"I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left."
304670,L666480,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
304671,L666358,u9030,m616,DURNFORD,My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
304672,L666357,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,"Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?"
304673,L666250,u9030,m616,DURNFORD,I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
304674,L666249,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,"Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth."
304675,L666248,u9027,m616,CHELMSFORD,They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD

304683,L666460,u9029,m616,CREALOCK,"The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi."
