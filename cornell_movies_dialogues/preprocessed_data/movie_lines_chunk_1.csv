36222,L237854,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
36223,L237839,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn."
36224,L237838,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Have you got it?
36225,L237828,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
36226,L237827,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,That's very considerate.
36227,L237826,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you."
36228,L237814,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Somehow I guessed.
36229,L237813,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.
36230,L237812,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Actually, no."
36231,L237811,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?"
36232,L237810,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,We need to talk.
36233,L237809,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
36234,L237808,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Got me out of trouble.
36235,L237807,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,What did I do?
36236,L237806,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I didn't have a chance to thank you.
36237,L237941,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-"
36238,L237940,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Afraid of lions.
36239,L237939,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Underneath.  Somewhere.
36240,L237938,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Where is it?
36241,L237932,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Once...
36242,L237931,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,He has children?
36243,L237926,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it."
36244,L237925,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
36245,L237852,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
36246,L237851,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
36247,L237834,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Since his beard was red.
36248,L237833,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,You've known him long?
36249,L237832,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Oh yes. But it takes time.
36250,L237831,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"You like him, don't you?"
36251,L237825,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I have to ask- why do you need me?
36252,L237824,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Soon.
36253,L237724,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,"You give me hope, John."
36254,L237723,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"I do, actually; very much."
36255,L237722,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Do you love her?
36256,L237721,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I expect so- it's from my wife.
36257,L237720,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Good news?
36258,L237719,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Thank you, Samuel."
36259,L237718,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,For you.
36260,L237713,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Look out, Samuel, here it comes."
36261,L237712,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,"Oh yes, I think so."
36262,L237705,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge."
36263,L237704,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
36264,L237688,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,"You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means ""slaughter""..."
36265,L237687,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Nonsense.
36266,L237686,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,You- they cannot believe you're still here.
36267,L237685,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,What are they looking at?
36268,L237638,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
36269,L237637,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,I am also liaison between these two.
36270,L237629,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,This is more difficult-
36271,L237628,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Did it look like this in your mind?
36272,L237625,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,"Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them."
36273,L237624,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,The workers don't get on?
36274,L237623,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
36275,L237622,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job."
36276,L237621,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,"Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge."
36277,L237620,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Why do the workers look unhappy?
36278,L237930,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Hold your son high.
36279,L237929,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Some mysteries should not have solutions.
36280,L237928,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
36281,L237923,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Help finish the railroad.
36282,L237922,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
36283,L237921,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Where do you go next?
36284,L237871,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible."
36285,L237870,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,And where will you sleep beautifully?
36286,L237869,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there."
36287,L237862,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Not even close.  What happened?
36288,L237861,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Did you ever see a lion that size?
36289,L237841,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men."
36290,L237840,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,Why so many?
36291,L237837,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,They will want a lot of money.
36292,L237836,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Four should do it.
36293,L237835,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,How many cattle?
36294,L237830,u1118,m73,SAMUEL,I don't believe you had a mother.
36295,L237829,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
36296,L239472,u1120,m74,DANA,I'd rather not.
36297,L239471,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it."
36298,L239470,u1120,m74,DANA,I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
36299,L239469,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking."
36300,L239468,u1120,m74,DANA,We don't have a relationship.
36301,L239467,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship."
36302,L239370,u1120,m74,DANA,I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
36303,L239369,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!"
36304,L239368,u1120,m74,DANA,Everybody has a choice.
36305,L239367,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
36306,L239366,u1120,m74,DANA,"If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it."
36307,L239365,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?"
36308,L239364,u1120,m74,DANA,What do you want with my baby?
36309,L239083,u1120,m74,DANA,"Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha."
36310,L239082,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?"
36311,L238961,u1120,m74,DANA,"Good night, Janosz."
36312,L238960,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you."
36313,L238959,u1120,m74,DANA,"No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway."
36314,L238958,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
36315,L238956,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?"
36316,L238955,u1120,m74,DANA,Janosz?
36317,L238809,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that."
36318,L238808,u1120,m74,DANA,I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
36319,L238807,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?"
36320,L238806,u1120,m74,DANA,"Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go."
36321,L238805,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
36322,L238804,u1120,m74,DANA,"Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra."
36323,L238803,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations."
36324,L238802,u1120,m74,DANA,"Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz."
36325,L238836,u1120,m74,DANA,Thank you.
36326,L238835,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I won't.
36327,L238834,u1120,m74,DANA,"Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind."
36328,L238833,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Certainly.
36329,L238832,u1120,m74,DANA,This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
36330,L238827,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,No.  Not that I can recall.
36331,L238826,u1120,m74,DANA,Does he ever mention me?
36332,L238825,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
36333,L238824,u1120,m74,DANA,How is he these days?
36334,L238823,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Occasionally
36335,L238822,u1120,m74,DANA,Do you ever see him?
36336,L238821,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Oh no.
36337,L238820,u1120,m74,DANA,"Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman."
36338,L238819,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you."
36339,L238817,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
36340,L238816,u1120,m74,DANA,"What are you working on, Egon?"
36341,L238813,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
36342,L238812,u1120,m74,DANA,"Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this."
36343,L238747,u1120,m74,DANA,That's exactly what you said last week.
36344,L238746,u1122,m74,FRANK,"Okay, that's no problem."
36345,L238745,u1120,m74,DANA,"No, you didn't, Frank."
36346,L238744,u1122,m74,FRANK,Didn't I do it?
36347,L238743,u1120,m74,DANA,"Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week."
36348,L238742,u1122,m74,FRANK,"That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett."
36349,L238741,u1122,m74,FRANK,"Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?"
36350,L238740,u1120,m74,DANA,"Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually."
36351,L238739,u1122,m74,FRANK,"Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her."
36352,L238738,u1120,m74,DANA,"You're also a human being, Frank."
36353,L238737,u1122,m74,FRANK,"I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent."
36354,L238736,u1120,m74,DANA,"Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?"
36355,L239537,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib."
36356,L239536,u1120,m74,DANA,That's a terrible thing to say.
36357,L239533,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Same difference.
36358,L239532,u1120,m74,DANA,That's not true.  It was 1620.
36359,L239500,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Finally came to your senses, huh?"
36360,L239499,u1120,m74,DANA,I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
36361,L239272,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
36362,L239271,u1120,m74,DANA,Maybe I should call Janine.
36363,L239270,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Let me jingle you right now.
36364,L239269,u1120,m74,DANA,So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
36365,L239268,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century."
36366,L239267,u1120,m74,DANA,Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
36367,L239266,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'm not even good for me.
36368,L239265,u1120,m74,DANA,"Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know."
36369,L239264,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?"
36370,L239263,u1120,m74,DANA,"For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?"
36371,L239262,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?"
36372,L239261,u1120,m74,DANA,I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
36373,L239260,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
36374,L239224,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty."
36375,L239223,u1120,m74,DANA,I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
36376,L239222,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
36377,L239221,u1120,m74,DANA,"Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner."
36378,L239220,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities."
36379,L239219,u1120,m74,DANA,Does she know anything about babies?
36380,L239218,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees."
36381,L239217,u1120,m74,DANA,I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
36382,L239216,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it."
36383,L239215,u1120,m74,DANA,"They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?"
36384,L239213,u1120,m74,DANA,"Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?"
36385,L239212,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Are you all squeaky clean now?
36386,L239153,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
36387,L239152,u1120,m74,DANA,Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
36388,L239151,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Or we could do that.
36389,L239150,u1120,m74,DANA,How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
36390,L239149,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
36391,L239148,u1120,m74,DANA,Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
36392,L239147,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here."
36393,L239145,u1120,m74,DANA,"Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know."
36394,L239144,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
36395,L239141,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know."
36396,L239140,u1120,m74,DANA,It was full of this awful pink ooze.
36397,L239139,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid."
36398,L239138,u1120,m74,DANA,"Peter, what about the bathtub?"
36399,L239137,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it."
36400,L239135,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
36401,L239134,u1120,m74,DANA,I don't know what to do anymore.
36402,L239133,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
36403,L239132,u1120,m74,DANA,I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
36404,L239131,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised."
36405,L239130,u1120,m74,DANA,"Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar."
36406,L239129,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?"
36407,L239128,u1120,m74,DANA,I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
36408,L239097,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!"
36409,L239096,u1120,m74,DANA,"Good-bye, Peter."
36410,L239095,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy."
36411,L239090,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner."
36412,L239089,u1120,m74,DANA,He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
36413,L239081,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case."
36414,L239080,u1120,m74,DANA,I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
36415,L239078,u1120,m74,DANA,I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
36416,L239077,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"You're really good, you know."
36417,L239076,u1120,m74,DANA,"Oh, hello, Peter."
36418,L239075,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"So this is what you do, huh?"
36419,L238974,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Thanks.
36420,L238973,u1120,m74,DANA,Good luck.
36421,L238972,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
36422,L238971,u1120,m74,DANA,You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
36423,L238970,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
36424,L238969,u1120,m74,DANA,Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
36425,L238968,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?"
36426,L238967,u1120,m74,DANA,I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
36427,L238903,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Okay, let's take a look."
36428,L238902,u1120,m74,DANA,That's where the buggy stopped.
36429,L238901,u1120,m74,DANA,We definitely had a moment or two.
36430,L238900,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?"
36431,L238894,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'll supervise.
36432,L238893,u1120,m74,DANA,I'll do it.
36433,L238892,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
36434,L238891,u1120,m74,DANA,"Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him."
36435,L238890,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Oscar!  You poor kid!
36436,L238889,u1120,m74,DANA,His name is Oscar.
36437,L238888,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
36438,L238887,u1120,m74,DANA,What do you think?
36439,L238881,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
36440,L238880,u1120,m74,DANA,"Well, when you started introducing me as ""the old ball and chain,"" that's when I left."
36441,L238879,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too."
36442,L238878,u1120,m74,DANA,"You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep."
36443,L238877,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know."
36444,L238876,u1120,m74,DANA,"He didn't ""ditch"" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it."
36445,L238875,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
36446,L238874,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys."
36447,L238873,u1120,m74,DANA,I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
36448,L238872,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?"
36449,L238871,u1120,m74,DANA,"Hello, Peter."
36450,L239299,u1120,m74,DANA,Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
36451,L239298,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Sorry!
36452,L238913,u1120,m74,DANA,"Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things."
36453,L238912,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street."
36454,L238905,u1120,m74,DANA,A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
36455,L238904,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Is this the spot?
36456,L238868,u1120,m74,DANA,"Hi, Egon."
36457,L238867,u1132,m74,STANTZ,No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
36458,L238866,u1120,m74,DANA,"Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming."
36459,L238784,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night."
36460,L238783,u1121,m74,ELAINE,"It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter."
36461,L238782,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
36462,L238781,u1121,m74,ELAINE,"I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world."
36463,L238780,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?"
36464,L238779,u1121,m74,ELAINE,"According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016."
36465,L239435,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one."
36466,L239434,u1123,m74,HARDEMEYER,"Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control."
36467,L239345,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Now you're talking.
36468,L239344,u1123,m74,HARDEMEYER,"Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?"
36469,L239343,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too."
36470,L239342,u1123,m74,HARDEMEYER,That's quite a story.
36471,L238799,u1123,m74,HARDEMEYER,"Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?"
36472,L238798,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you."
36473,L238797,u1123,m74,HARDEMEYER,"I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?"
36474,L238796,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
36475,L238795,u1123,m74,HARDEMEYER,I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
36476,L238794,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest."
36477,L238793,u1123,m74,HARDEMEYER,Can I help you?
36478,L239454,u1124,m74,JANINE,"You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck."
36479,L239453,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum."
36480,L239452,u1124,m74,JANINE,I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
36481,L239327,u1127,m74,LOUIS,You're right.  We should stay.
36482,L239326,u1124,m74,JANINE,I don't think we should leave her alone.
36483,L239325,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Should we go?
36484,L239280,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Tonight?
36485,L239279,u1124,m74,JANINE,Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
36486,L239278,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Okay.
36487,L239277,u1124,m74,JANINE,"You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?"
36488,L239276,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired."
36489,L239275,u1124,m74,JANINE,It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
36490,L239274,u1127,m74,LOUIS,So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
36491,L239273,u1124,m74,JANINE,I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
36492,L239240,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Oh, sure, that sounds great."
36493,L239239,u1124,m74,JANINE,"I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?"
36494,L239238,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?"
36495,L239237,u1124,m74,JANINE,"Well, good night, Louis."
36496,L239236,u1124,m74,JANINE,"That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too."
36497,L239235,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds."
36498,L239234,u1124,m74,JANINE,Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
36499,L239233,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt."
36500,L239232,u1124,m74,JANINE,Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
36501,L239231,u1127,m74,LOUIS,I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
36502,L239230,u1124,m74,JANINE,What are you doing up here?
36503,L239229,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
36504,L239048,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Ghostbusters.
36505,L239047,u1124,m74,JANINE,Who are you going to call?
36506,L239046,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
36507,L239045,u1124,m74,JANINE,It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
36508,L239044,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"What is it, honey?"
36509,L239486,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse."
36510,L239485,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him."
36511,L239194,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
36512,L239193,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"So you see, everything is in order, is it not?"
36513,L239184,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you."
36514,L239183,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
36515,L239182,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,This is the one that looked at Dana.
36516,L239178,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,The Upper West Side.
36517,L239177,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?"
36518,L239175,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
36519,L239174,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,Then why have you come?
36520,L239173,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I know.
36521,L239172,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
36522,L239094,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,My pleasure.
36523,L239093,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
36524,L239092,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you."
36525,L239091,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman."
36526,L239088,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,
36527,L239087,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Too bad for the Moldavians.
36528,L239086,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century."
36529,L239085,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?"
36530,L239084,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
36531,L239336,u1134,m74,VIGO,"So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me."
36532,L239335,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?"
36533,L239334,u1134,m74,VIGO,The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
36534,L239333,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,I await the word of Vigo.
36535,L239332,u1134,m74,VIGO,I command you.
36536,L239331,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,-- the sorrow --
36537,L239330,u1134,m74,VIGO,-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
36538,L239329,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Yes, the scourge --"
36539,L239328,u1134,m74,VIGO,"I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --"
36540,L238917,u1134,m74,VIGO,"On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again."
36541,L238916,u1125,m74,JANOSZ,"Command me, lord."
36542,L238915,u1134,m74,VIGO,"I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you."
36543,L239029,u1126,m74,JUDGE,You've got to stop them.  Please!
36544,L239028,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,These boys aren't playing around.
36545,L239027,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Maybe they just want to appeal.
36546,L239026,u1126,m74,JUDGE,They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
36547,L239025,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Who are they?
36548,L239024,u1126,m74,JUDGE,You've got to do something!
36549,L239005,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist."
36550,L239004,u1126,m74,JUDGE,"Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt."
36551,L239018,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Did I forget something?
36552,L239017,u1126,m74,JUDGE,That's it?  That's all you have to say?
36553,L239015,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you."
36554,L239014,u1126,m74,JUDGE,"Get on with it, counselor!"
36555,L239013,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Can I have some of your water?
36556,L239012,u1126,m74,JUDGE,Yes.
36557,L239011,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Your honor, may I approach the bench?"
36558,L238999,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Do I?
36559,L238998,u1126,m74,JUDGE,"Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?"
36560,L238995,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?"
36561,L238994,u1126,m74,JUDGE,The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
36562,L239410,u1127,m74,LOUIS,I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
36563,L239409,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
36564,L239408,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there."
36565,L239407,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,"Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --"
36566,L239406,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out."
36567,L239390,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
36568,L239389,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm."
36569,L239388,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,"Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble."
36570,L239387,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?"
36571,L239386,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,You were the one who got me in.
36572,L239385,u1127,m74,LOUIS,I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
36573,L239384,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,Like what?
36574,L239383,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you."
36575,L239382,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
36576,L239381,u1127,m74,LOUIS,Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
36577,L239380,u1130,m74,SHERMAN,"I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license."
36578,L239379,u1127,m74,LOUIS,"Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you."
36579,L238778,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?"
36580,L238777,u1128,m74,MILTON,This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
36581,L238776,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe."
36582,L238775,u1128,m74,MILTON,I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
36583,L238774,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?"
36584,L238773,u1128,m74,MILTON,"Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger."
36585,L238772,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?"
36586,L239009,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it."
36587,L239008,u1129,m74,PROSECUTOR,So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
36588,L239007,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in."
36589,L239006,u1129,m74,PROSECUTOR,"I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath."
36590,L239003,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
36591,L239002,u1129,m74,PROSECUTOR,"So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street."
36592,L238997,u1129,m74,PROSECUTOR,Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
36593,L238996,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Yes, I did.  We were city champs."
36594,L239527,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
36595,L239526,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
36596,L239525,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,From where -- Neptune?
36597,L239524,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
36598,L239523,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Pretty impressive, huh?"
36599,L239476,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
36600,L239475,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,So far so good.
36601,L239474,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"They love you, Lib.  Keep it up."
36602,L239473,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
36603,L239301,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop."
36604,L239300,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?"
36605,L239245,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
36606,L239244,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population."
36607,L239163,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
36608,L239162,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"That's it?  ""I'll be back?"""
36609,L239157,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he."
36610,L239156,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"""Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"""
36611,L238930,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,You need the exercise.
36612,L238929,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,You were supposed to help me with this.
36613,L238911,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I knew that.
36614,L238910,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,That's a thousand million electron volts.
36615,L238899,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
36616,L238898,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
36617,L238897,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"What now, Brainiac?"
36618,L238884,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?"
36619,L238883,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I'd like to have a stool specimen
36620,L238855,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I don't even want to know where that is.
36621,L238854,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
36622,L238853,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?"
36623,L238852,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"Hello, Venkman."
36624,L238851,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Egon!
36625,L239491,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Do it!  Just do it!
36626,L239490,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
36627,L239431,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Something good --
36628,L239430,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
36629,L239429,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --"
36630,L239428,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it."
36631,L239427,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
36632,L239286,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you."
36633,L239285,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker."
36634,L239255,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Nine feet -- ten --
36635,L239254,u1132,m74,STANTZ,That's it.  It's on the bottom.
36636,L239253,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Six feet -- seven -- eight --
36637,L239161,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, ""Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."""
36638,L239160,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"No, not exactly a man of the people.  ""Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."""
36639,L239052,u1132,m74,STANTZ,And we're the ...
36640,L239051,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,I'm Egon --
36641,L238989,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
36642,L238988,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there."
36643,L238964,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"His nickname is ""The Hammer."""
36644,L238963,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?"
36645,L238941,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,What's the reading?
36646,L238940,u1132,m74,STANTZ,This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
36647,L238939,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870."
36648,L238907,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
36649,L238906,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Nothing.  Not a trace.
36650,L238844,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Good idea.
36651,L238843,u1132,m74,STANTZ,You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
36652,L238842,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses."
36653,L238841,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
36654,L238840,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,Who was that?
36655,L239508,u1135,m74,WINSTON,There's something very familiar about this painting.
36656,L239507,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi."
36657,L239297,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,And it's all flowing toward the museum.
36658,L239296,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Rivers of the stuff!
36659,L239257,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,"No, the slime is rising."
36660,L239256,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Is the line sinking?
36661,L239196,u1135,m74,WINSTON,I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
36662,L239195,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
36663,L239111,u1135,m74,WINSTON,You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
36664,L239110,u1131,m74,SPENGLER,We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
36665,L239535,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great."
36666,L239534,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"What's your story, Pete?"
36667,L239529,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?"
36668,L239528,u1132,m74,STANTZ,My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
36669,L239520,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island."
36670,L239519,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?"
36671,L239488,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know."
36672,L239487,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey."
36673,L239480,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,She's new in town.
36674,L239479,u1132,m74,STANTZ,My Fault!
36675,L239478,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it."
36676,L239477,u1132,m74,STANTZ,I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
36677,L239466,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab."
36678,L239465,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th."
36679,L239450,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?"
36680,L239449,u1132,m74,STANTZ,I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
36681,L239426,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?"
36682,L239425,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
36683,L239416,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I hate Jello.
36684,L239415,u1132,m74,STANTZ,It looks like a giant Jello mold.
36685,L239295,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually."
36686,L239294,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place."
36687,L239293,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!"
36688,L239249,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Okay, but you're missing all the fun."
36689,L239248,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out."
36690,L239243,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
36691,L239242,u1132,m74,STANTZ,We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
36692,L239241,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?"
36693,L239206,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
36694,L239205,u1132,m74,STANTZ,What happened?
36695,L239186,u1132,m74,STANTZ,I'll get one more reading.
36696,L239185,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here."
36697,L239155,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:"
36698,L239154,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Did you find anything at Dana's?
36699,L239116,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?"
36700,L239115,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --"
36701,L239114,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,What kind of tests?
36702,L239113,u1132,m74,STANTZ,We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
36703,L239112,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Like a goat on garbage.
36704,L239109,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
36705,L239108,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states."
36706,L239107,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,This is what you do with your spare time?
36707,L239102,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state."
36708,L239101,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,And now you're going to eat it?
36709,L239099,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?"
36710,L239098,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you."
36711,L239065,u1132,m74,STANTZ,If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
36712,L239064,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
36713,L239057,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon."
36714,L239056,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?"
36715,L239055,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan."
36716,L239050,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I'm Peter --
36717,L239049,u1132,m74,STANTZ,I'm Ray --
36718,L239034,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Okay, let's heat 'em up!"
36719,L239033,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are."
36720,L238920,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile."
36721,L238919,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting."
36722,L238918,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one."
36723,L238909,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
36724,L238908,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,What's that?
36725,L238896,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now."
36726,L238895,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Well, Holmes, what do you think?"
36727,L238865,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Dana!  Dana Barrett!
36728,L238864,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Who, Ray?"
36729,L238863,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
36730,L238862,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Who?  Who?  Who?
36731,L238861,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Oh, Ray --"
36732,L238860,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Who?  Just -- someone we know.
36733,L238859,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Who?
36734,L238858,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Oh, just checking something for an old friend."
36735,L238857,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Great.  So what are you guys working on?
36736,L238850,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something."
36737,L238849,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
36738,L238848,u1132,m74,STANTZ,I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
36739,L238847,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"So, no goat hooves, huh?"
36740,L238846,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Oh, hiya, Pete."
36741,L238845,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request."
36742,L239494,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
36743,L239493,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?"
36744,L239459,u1135,m74,WINSTON,I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
36745,L239458,u1132,m74,STANTZ,She's moving!
36746,L239289,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil."
36747,L239288,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you."
36748,L239284,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it."
36749,L239283,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out."
36750,L239282,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line."
36751,L239281,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?"
36752,L239208,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys."
36753,L239207,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Are you all right?
36754,L239202,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Well don't think!
36755,L239201,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"No, I just thought --"
36756,L239200,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Are you telling me how to drive?
36757,L239192,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go."
36758,L239191,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
36759,L239190,u1132,m74,STANTZ,What?  Yeah.
36760,L239189,u1135,m74,WINSTON,You finished here?
36761,L239188,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Huh?  What?
36762,L239187,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Now that's one ugly dude.
36763,L239171,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal ""Stabilize -- All Clear."""
36764,L239170,u1135,m74,WINSTON,You got a flux and a half.
36765,L239159,u1135,m74,WINSTON,I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
36766,L239158,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered."
36767,L239119,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson."
36768,L239118,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Does it have any favorites?
36769,L238771,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow."
36770,L238770,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise."
36771,L238769,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
36772,L238768,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are."
36773,L238767,u1132,m74,STANTZ,"Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season."
36774,L238766,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds."
36775,L238755,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Then let's do it.
36776,L238754,u1135,m74,WINSTON,I'm ready.
36777,L238753,u1132,m74,STANTZ,Ready?
36778,L239531,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
36779,L239530,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?"
36780,L239463,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
36781,L239462,u1135,m74,WINSTON,How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
36782,L239447,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know."
36783,L239446,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Wonder what?
36784,L239445,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,"Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
36785,L239433,u1135,m74,WINSTON,And decent.
36786,L239432,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,And pure --
36787,L239374,u1135,m74,WINSTON,You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
36788,L239373,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
36789,L239340,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
36790,L239339,u1135,m74,WINSTON,Tell him about the toaster.
36791,L239123,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,So we'll put a warning on the label.
36792,L239122,u1135,m74,WINSTON,"Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand."
36793,L239121,u1133,m74,VENKMAN,I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
36794,L239796,u1136,m75,BRIDE,"What's the matter, dear?"
36795,L239795,u1141,m75,GROOM,Uuuuuuugh!!
36796,L239794,u1136,m75,BRIDE,"Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!"
36797,L239792,u1136,m75,BRIDE,Have I done the right thing?
36798,L239791,u1141,m75,GROOM,"To the bathroom, where do you think?"
36799,L239790,u1136,m75,BRIDE,Now where are you going?
36800,L239789,u1136,m75,BRIDE,"I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!"
36801,L239788,u1141,m75,GROOM,"Nice going, honey.  It was brand new."
36802,L239787,u1136,m75,BRIDE,Roy?  Your clock broke.
36803,L239785,u1136,m75,BRIDE,"Well, thanks a lot."
36804,L239784,u1141,m75,GROOM,I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
36805,L239783,u1136,m75,BRIDE,Aren't you glad we waited?
36806,L239577,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"I was just going to say ""eight.""  You're fantastic!"
36807,L239576,u1137,m75,COED,Eight o'clock?
36808,L239575,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
36809,L239569,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
36810,L239568,u1137,m75,COED,"Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?"
36811,L239567,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, I guess some people have it and some don't."
36812,L239554,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up."
36813,L239553,u1137,m75,COED,No.  They're just coming to me.
36814,L239552,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?"
36815,L239551,u1137,m75,COED,Ummm -- figure eight?
36816,L239550,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Ready?  What is it?
36817,L239546,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
36818,L239545,u1137,m75,COED,Is it a star?
36819,L240310,u1138,m75,DANA,"All right, what happened to me?"
36820,L240309,u1144,m75,LOUIS,"I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway."
36821,L240308,u1138,m75,DANA,"Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this."
36822,L240220,u1138,m75,DANA,I am Zuul.
36823,L240219,u1144,m75,LOUIS,Are you the Gatekeeper?
36824,L240015,u1144,m75,LOUIS,I got the Twister game for later ...
36825,L240014,u1138,m75,DANA,"Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink."
36826,L240013,u1144,m75,LOUIS,"Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though."
36827,L240012,u1138,m75,DANA,"Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by."
36828,L240011,u1144,m75,LOUIS,"Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party."
36829,L240010,u1138,m75,DANA,"Hi, Louis."
36830,L240009,u1144,m75,LOUIS,"Oh, Dana, it's you."
36831,L239676,u1138,m75,DANA,I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
36832,L239675,u1144,m75,LOUIS,You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
36833,L239674,u1138,m75,DANA,"Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around."
36834,L239673,u1144,m75,LOUIS,"Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ..."
36835,L239672,u1138,m75,DANA,"No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning."
36836,L239671,u1144,m75,LOUIS,"Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped ""20 Minute Workout"" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?"
36837,L239670,u1138,m75,DANA,"Are you sick, Louis?"
36838,L239669,u1144,m75,LOUIS,... I thought it was the drug store.
36839,L239668,u1138,m75,DANA,"Hi, Louis."
36840,L239667,u1144,m75,LOUIS,"Oh, Dana, it's you ..."
36841,L240316,u1138,m75,DANA,Talk to my accountant.
36842,L240315,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high."
36843,L240314,u1138,m75,DANA,Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
36844,L240313,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work."
36845,L240312,u1138,m75,DANA,Really!  Is it gone?
36846,L240311,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
36847,L240064,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Whoa!! Nice voice.
36848,L240063,u1138,m75,DANA,There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
36849,L240062,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ..."
36850,L240061,u1138,m75,DANA,I am Zuul.  I am ...
36851,L240060,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
36852,L240059,u1138,m75,DANA,I want you inside me.
36853,L240058,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule."
36854,L240056,u1138,m75,DANA,Take me now.
36855,L240055,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you."
36856,L240054,u1138,m75,DANA,Do you want this body?
36857,L240053,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom."
36858,L240052,u1138,m75,DANA,He is the Destructor.
36859,L240051,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?"
36860,L240050,u1138,m75,DANA,We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
36861,L240048,u1138,m75,DANA,I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
36862,L240047,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?"
36863,L239944,u1138,m75,DANA,I've got to go now.
36864,L239943,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
36865,L239942,u1138,m75,DANA,All right.  Since you put it that way.
36866,L239941,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
36867,L239940,u1138,m75,DANA,I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
36868,L239939,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
36869,L239938,u1138,m75,DANA,What's he doing in my refrigerator.
36870,L239937,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"""Gozer"" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods."
36871,L239936,u1138,m75,DANA,"Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  ""Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."""
36872,L239935,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?"
36873,L239934,u1138,m75,DANA,You must have gotten the last copy.
36874,L239933,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name ""Zuul"" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it."
36875,L239932,u1138,m75,DANA,Can't you tell me now?
36876,L239931,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant."
36877,L239930,u1138,m75,DANA,He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
36878,L239929,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Is he dying or something?
36879,L239928,u1138,m75,DANA,"The ""stiff?""  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man."
36880,L239927,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Who's the stiff?
36881,L239926,u1138,m75,DANA,I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
36882,L239925,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
36883,L239924,u1138,m75,DANA,Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
36884,L239923,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,You're the best one in your row.
36885,L239922,u1138,m75,DANA,You heard it?
36886,L239921,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Great rehearsal.
36887,L239776,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,No kiss?
36888,L239775,u1138,m75,DANA,Goodbye.
36889,L239774,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Okay.  Then I'll go.
36890,L239773,u1138,m75,DANA,All right.
36891,L239772,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me."
36892,L239771,u1138,m75,DANA,Then leave.
36893,L239770,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Don't scream.
36894,L239769,u1138,m75,DANA,I'll scream.
36895,L239768,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I want to help you.
36896,L239767,u1138,m75,DANA,Out!
36897,L239766,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,On a purely scientific basis.
36898,L239765,u1138,m75,DANA,That's it.  Get out.
36899,L239764,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I think I should spend the night here.
36900,L239763,u1138,m75,DANA,All right.  What do you want to do?
36901,L239762,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
36902,L239761,u1138,m75,DANA,Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
36903,L239760,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy."
36904,L239759,u1138,m75,DANA,This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
36905,L239758,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
36906,L239757,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yeah, yeah."
36907,L239756,u1138,m75,DANA,Are you all right?
36908,L239755,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Damn!
36909,L239753,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I know.  It happened by itself.
36910,L239752,u1138,m75,DANA,"I told you, I ..."
36911,L239751,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,You're quite a housekeeper.
36912,L239750,u1138,m75,DANA,I'll wait here if you don't mind.
36913,L239749,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, let's check it out."
36914,L239748,u1138,m75,DANA,Uh-huh.
36915,L239747,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
36916,L239746,u1138,m75,DANA,What?
36917,L239745,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,That's too bad.
36918,L239743,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Thanks.  What's in there?
36919,L239742,u1138,m75,DANA,Like a used car salesman.
36920,L239741,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,No?  What do I act like?
36921,L239740,u1138,m75,DANA,You really don't act like a scientist.
36922,L239739,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yeah, but it's got a great cello break."
36923,L239738,u1138,m75,DANA,That's a violin concerto.
36924,L239737,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
36925,L239736,u1138,m75,DANA,Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
36926,L239735,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
36927,L239734,u1138,m75,DANA,No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
36928,L239733,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
36929,L239732,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Spengler,  see if you can find the word ""Zuul"" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment."
36930,L239731,u1138,m75,DANA,"No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means."
36931,L239728,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,It's in the stars.
36932,L239727,u1138,m75,DANA,Is that your professional opinion?
36933,L239720,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
36934,L239719,u1138,m75,DANA,Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
36935,L239715,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,So what do you think it was?
36936,L239714,u1138,m75,DANA,... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
36937,L239711,u1138,m75,DANA,Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
36938,L239710,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"We're all professionals here, Miss ..."
36939,L239709,u1138,m75,DANA,Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
36940,L239708,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
36941,L239640,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I see.
36942,L239639,u1139,m75,DEAN YAEGER,"Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of ""dodge"" or ""hustle.""  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University."
36943,L239638,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,But why?  The students love us!
36944,L239637,u1139,m75,DEAN YAEGER,Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
36945,L239636,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
36946,L239635,u1139,m75,DEAN YAEGER,"No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately."
36947,L239634,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
36948,L240323,u1140,m75,FIRST BUM,That would definitely explain it.
36949,L240322,u1147,m75,SECOND BUM,I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
36950,L240321,u1140,m75,FIRST BUM,You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
36951,L240320,u1147,m75,SECOND BUM,"Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure."
36952,L240319,u1140,m75,FIRST BUM,"Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me."
36953,L240032,u1147,m75,SECOND BUM,"Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think."
36954,L240031,u1140,m75,FIRST BUM,He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
36955,L240030,u1147,m75,SECOND BUM,That is one speedy mutt.
36956,L239621,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,We'll get back to you.
36957,L239620,u1142,m75,HEAD LIBRARIAN,Did you see it?  What was it?
36958,L239602,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!"
36959,L239601,u1142,m75,HEAD LIBRARIAN,What's that got to do with it?
36960,L239593,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
36961,L239592,u1142,m75,HEAD LIBRARIAN,Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
36962,L239591,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
36963,L239590,u1142,m75,HEAD LIBRARIAN,"Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?"
36964,L240232,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Thank you.
36965,L240231,u1143,m75,JANINE,Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
36966,L240230,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,I don't believe in luck.
36967,L240229,u1143,m75,JANINE,It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
36968,L240228,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,What is it?
36969,L240227,u1143,m75,JANINE,I want you to have this.
36970,L240118,u1143,m75,JANINE,That's so romantic.
36971,L240117,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void."
36972,L240116,u1143,m75,JANINE,In the physical sense.
36973,L240115,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Die in what sense?
36974,L240114,u1143,m75,JANINE,"Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die."
36975,L239707,u1143,m75,JANINE,Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
36976,L239706,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,I think it's the food of the future.
36977,L239705,u1143,m75,JANINE,"Oh, that's very - unusual."
36978,L239704,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"I collect spores, molds and fungus."
36979,L239703,u1143,m75,JANINE,It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
36980,L239702,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Is that a game?
36981,L239701,u1143,m75,JANINE,That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
36982,L239700,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Print is dead.
36983,L239699,u1143,m75,JANINE,"You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too."
36984,L239966,u1143,m75,JANINE,"Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me."
36985,L239965,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry."
36986,L239964,u1143,m75,JANINE,I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
36987,L239963,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,The EPA?  What's he want?
36988,L239962,u1143,m75,JANINE,And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
36989,L239958,u1143,m75,JANINE,Here are tonight's calls.
36990,L239957,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
36991,L239713,u1143,m75,JANINE,What calls?
36992,L239712,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine."
36993,L239805,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time."
36994,L239804,u1145,m75,MANAGER,"Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight."
36995,L239803,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Did you ever report it to anyone?
36996,L239802,u1145,m75,MANAGER,"Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though."
36997,L239801,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Has this ever happened before?
36998,L239800,u1145,m75,MANAGER,Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
36999,L240208,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
37000,L240207,u1146,m75,PECK,"That's ""Peck!"""
37001,L240206,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ..."
37002,L240197,u1146,m75,PECK,"Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ..."
37003,L240196,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"The man is a psychopath, Your Honor."
37004,L240157,u1146,m75,PECK,See!  They are using drugs.
37005,L240156,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie."
37006,L240132,u1146,m75,PECK,"Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass."
37007,L240131,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can."
37008,L239995,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
37009,L239994,u1146,m75,PECK,"Have it your way, Mr. Venkman."
37010,L239993,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
37011,L239992,u1146,m75,PECK,"Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order."
37012,L239991,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Why do you want to see it?
37013,L239990,u1146,m75,PECK,May I please see the storage facility?
37014,L239989,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"The magic word is ""please."""
37015,L239988,u1146,m75,PECK,"And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?"
37016,L239987,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Because you didn't say the magic word.
37017,L239986,u1146,m75,PECK,"And why not, Mr. Venkman?"
37018,L239985,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"No, you may not."
37019,L239984,u1146,m75,PECK,And may I see this storage facility?
37020,L239983,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yes, it would."
37021,L239982,u1146,m75,PECK,And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
37022,L239981,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,In a storage facility.
37023,L239980,u1146,m75,PECK,And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
37024,L239979,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'm not at liberty to say.
37025,L239978,u1146,m75,PECK,"And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?"
37026,L239977,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,You could say that.
37027,L239976,u1146,m75,PECK,I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
37028,L239975,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
37029,L239974,u1146,m75,PECK,"Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?"
37030,L239973,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman."
37031,L239972,u1146,m75,PECK,Are you Peter Venkman?
37032,L239971,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Great!  How's it going?
37033,L239970,u1146,m75,PECK,"I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District."
37034,L239969,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Can I help you?
37035,L239565,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Then my theory was correct.
37036,L239564,u1148,m75,SOPHOMORE,I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
37037,L239563,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
37038,L239562,u1148,m75,SOPHOMORE,"Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?"
37039,L239561,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?"
37040,L239560,u1148,m75,SOPHOMORE,Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
37041,L239559,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Sorry.  This isn't your day.
37042,L239558,u1148,m75,SOPHOMORE,Two wavy lines?
37043,L239557,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?"
37044,L239556,u1148,m75,SOPHOMORE,Yes.  I don't like this.
37045,L239555,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Nervous?
37046,L239549,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Close -- but definitely wrong.
37047,L239548,u1148,m75,SOPHOMORE,Circle?
37048,L239543,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Good guess -- but no.
37049,L239542,u1148,m75,SOPHOMORE,A square?
37050,L239541,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,All right.  What is it?
37051,L239902,u1151,m75,STREET PUNK,Wow!
37052,L239901,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
37053,L239900,u1151,m75,STREET PUNK,"Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?"
37054,L239899,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
37055,L239898,u1151,m75,STREET PUNK,"Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em."
37056,L239897,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
37057,L239896,u1151,m75,STREET PUNK,"Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?"
37058,L239828,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?"
37059,L239827,u1154,m75,WOMAN,You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
37060,L239826,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ..."
37061,L239825,u1154,m75,WOMAN,What on earth gave you that idea?
37062,L239824,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Were you recently in the bathroom?
37063,L239823,u1154,m75,WOMAN,Yes?
37064,L240302,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,But it's my favorite state.
37065,L240301,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Life is just a state of mind.
37066,L240300,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
37067,L240299,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
37068,L240298,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
37069,L240289,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Full-stream with strogon pulse.
37070,L240288,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,What now?
37071,L240184,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor."
37072,L240183,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,You talked to Gozer?
37073,L240182,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Gozer.
37074,L240181,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Who?
37075,L240180,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"She said he was ""the Destructor."""
37076,L240179,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world."
37077,L240178,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
37078,L240177,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920."
37079,L240153,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"Oh, shit!"
37080,L240152,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Where's the Keymaster?
37081,L240134,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
37082,L240133,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,He wants to shut down the storage grid.
37083,L240113,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"All right, Peter.  Good night."
37084,L240112,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
37085,L240111,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,All right.  I'll try.
37086,L240110,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous."
37087,L240109,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,I agree.
37088,L240108,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point."
37089,L240107,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
37090,L240106,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
37091,L240105,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Does she want to be?
37092,L240104,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
37093,L240103,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,What is it?
37094,L240102,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem."
37095,L239858,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension."
37096,L239857,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"What do you mean ""bad?"""
37097,L239856,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Trust me.  It will be bad.
37098,L239855,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Why not?
37099,L239854,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Don't cross the beams.
37100,L239853,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,What?
37101,L239852,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
37102,L239819,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yeah, I can smell it."
37103,L239818,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Something was definitely here.
37104,L239780,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping."
37105,L239779,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Did you see anything?
37106,L239718,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
37107,L239717,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?"
37108,L239656,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
37109,L239655,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000."
37110,L239629,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Wow!
37111,L239628,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,I'm always serious.
37112,L239627,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?"
37113,L239589,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?"
37114,L239588,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here."
37115,L239587,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"What have you got, Egon?"
37116,L239586,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Oh!  You're here.
37117,L240272,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,That appears to be the case.
37118,L240271,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?"
37119,L240170,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores."
37120,L240169,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
37121,L240151,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
37122,L240150,u1150,m75,STANTZ,What happened??!!!?
37123,L240000,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom."
37124,L239999,u1150,m75,STANTZ,I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
37125,L239998,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,I've got to sleep.
37126,L239997,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Neutronize.  System shut.
37127,L239996,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Set entry grid.
37128,L239869,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
37129,L239868,u1150,m75,STANTZ,It's working!
37130,L239832,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"God, it's ugly!"
37131,L239831,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
37132,L239817,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,We'd better adjust our streams.
37133,L239816,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Sorry, Buddy!"
37134,L239811,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,I blame myself.
37135,L239810,u1150,m75,STANTZ,I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
37136,L239722,u1149,m75,SPENGLER,"Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either."
37137,L239721,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present."
37138,L240287,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
37139,L240286,u1150,m75,STANTZ,The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
37140,L240285,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
37141,L240280,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Look!
37142,L240279,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,What?  What popped in there?
37143,L240278,u1150,m75,STANTZ,I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
37144,L240262,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
37145,L240261,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Agile bastard, isn't he?"
37146,L240255,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, that ought to do it."
37147,L240254,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension."
37148,L240252,u1150,m75,STANTZ,I don't think it's Shandor.
37149,L240251,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
37150,L240176,u1150,m75,STANTZ,He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
37151,L240175,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Who was the architect?
37152,L240174,u1150,m75,STANTZ,No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
37153,L240173,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?"
37154,L240006,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"It's not good, Pete."
37155,L240005,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?"
37156,L239956,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
37157,L239955,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Boy, that was a rough one."
37158,L239845,u1150,m75,STANTZ,I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
37159,L239844,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,How do you know?
37160,L239843,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
37161,L239842,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me."
37162,L239841,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild."
37163,L239840,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
37164,L239839,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Third floor.  Get down here,"
37165,L239838,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Where are you, Pete?"
37166,L239837,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Ray -- Something's here.
37167,L239822,u1150,m75,STANTZ,All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
37168,L239821,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
37169,L239820,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something."
37170,L239814,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
37171,L239813,u1150,m75,STANTZ,No sense worrying about it now.
37172,L239812,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,So do I.
37173,L239782,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
37174,L239781,u1150,m75,STANTZ,They will.
37175,L239778,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
37176,L239777,u1150,m75,STANTZ,How was your date?
37177,L239730,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
37178,L239729,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
37179,L239697,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Fourteen hundred.
37180,L239696,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
37181,L239695,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
37182,L239663,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of ""pricey"" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company."
37183,L239662,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Wow!  Does this pole still work?
37184,L239658,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
37185,L239657,u1150,m75,STANTZ,But most people are afraid to even report these things.
37186,L239654,u1150,m75,STANTZ,But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
37187,L239653,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
37188,L239652,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"My parents left me that house, I was born there."
37189,L239651,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"You'll never regret this, Ray."
37190,L239649,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,To go into business for ourselves.
37191,L239648,u1150,m75,STANTZ,For what purpose?
37192,L239647,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there."
37193,L239646,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there."
37194,L239645,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
37195,L239644,u1150,m75,STANTZ,This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
37196,L239642,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too."
37197,L239641,u1150,m75,STANTZ,You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
37198,L239633,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something."
37199,L239632,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment."
37200,L239631,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize."
37201,L239624,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady."
37202,L239623,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?"
37203,L239622,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"""Get her?""  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?"
37204,L239615,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
37205,L239614,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else."
37206,L239613,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Anything!  Just make contact.
37207,L239612,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,What do I say?
37208,L239611,u1150,m75,STANTZ,I don't know.  Talk to it.
37209,L239610,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,What do we do now?
37210,L239609,u1150,m75,STANTZ,I told you it's real.
37211,L239607,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
37212,L239606,u1150,m75,STANTZ,What is it?
37213,L239583,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler."
37214,L239582,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once."
37215,L239581,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,Looked at with your eyes.
37216,L239580,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"What do you mean by ""seen?"""
37217,L239579,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?"
37218,L239578,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
37219,L239574,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it."
37220,L239573,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens."
37221,L239572,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian."
37222,L239571,u1152,m75,VENKMAN,"Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?"
37223,L240268,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"What do you mean ""choose?""  We don't understand."
37224,L240267,u1153,m75,WINSTON,What's he talking about?  Choose what?
37225,L240121,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"LATER, MAN!!"
37226,L240120,u1153,m75,WINSTON,Stantz?  You okay in there?
37227,L240088,u1153,m75,WINSTON,Right.  We'll believe anything.
37228,L240087,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"You don't have to worry about that with us, sir."
37229,L240083,u1153,m75,WINSTON,"Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?"
37230,L240082,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
37231,L240081,u1153,m75,WINSTON,"Yeah, Judgement Day."
37232,L240080,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Judgement Day ...
37233,L240079,u1153,m75,WINSTON,Right.  And the sky would fall ...
37234,L240078,u1150,m75,STANTZ,And the seas would boil ...
37235,L240077,u1153,m75,WINSTON,"Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?"
37236,L240076,u1150,m75,STANTZ,The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
37237,L240075,u1153,m75,WINSTON,"Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great."
37238,L240074,u1150,m75,STANTZ,No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
37239,L240073,u1153,m75,WINSTON,Do you believe in God?
37240,L240072,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
37241,L240071,u1153,m75,WINSTON,"Me, too."
37242,L240070,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Mmmhmmm.
37243,L240069,u1153,m75,WINSTON,"Are you a Christian, Ray?"
37244,L240068,u1150,m75,STANTZ,Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
37245,L240067,u1153,m75,WINSTON,Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
37246,L239968,u1153,m75,WINSTON,"Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do."
37247,L239967,u1150,m75,STANTZ,"Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship."
37248,L243076,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
37249,L243075,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
37250,L243074,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
37251,L243028,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Do you want posters, too?"
37252,L243027,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action..."
37253,L242988,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Send them out!
37254,L242987,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Not yet, dear brother..."
37255,L242986,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,I am their hero!
37256,L242985,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
37257,L242984,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,I want that bastard dead!
37258,L242983,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
37259,L242982,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
37260,L242948,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"""... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"""
37261,L242947,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Yes?  Go on!
37262,L242946,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"""... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."""
37263,L242930,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"But I get what I want, always, don't I?"
37264,L242929,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
37265,L242928,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
37266,L242927,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,What are you talking about?
37267,L242926,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating."
37268,L242925,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
37269,L242924,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,What is that... wailing?
37270,L242923,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet."
37271,L242922,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
37272,L242921,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
37273,L242920,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Where have you been?
37274,L242844,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?"
37275,L242843,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,You're coming back?
37276,L242842,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Tribuus... tomorrow.
37277,L242841,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
37278,L242840,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
37279,L242790,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Why not do it in the Colosseum?
37280,L242789,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"For the gods, spit it out!"
37281,L242788,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,If I may be so bold...
37282,L242787,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
37283,L242768,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
37284,L242767,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
37285,L242766,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
37286,L242765,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Those are priceless sculptures.
37287,L242734,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me."
37288,L242733,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
37289,L242730,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"I'm sure, I don't know."
37290,L242729,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
37291,L242728,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
37292,L242727,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"I should at least have you, don't you think?"
37293,L242725,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability."
37294,L242724,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"They hate me, they really hate me don't they?"
37295,L242699,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
37296,L242698,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Don't you think you should at least wave?
37297,L242491,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
37298,L242490,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
37299,L242468,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man."
37300,L242467,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
37301,L242466,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that."
37302,L242412,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
37303,L242411,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
37304,L242410,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,That's what you told me two days ago!
37305,L242409,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"We're nearly there, Lucilla."
37306,L242408,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!"
37307,L243023,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again."
37308,L243022,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
37309,L242641,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,On what charge?
37310,L242640,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried..."
37311,L242639,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
37312,L242638,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
37313,L242637,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Where is my family?
37314,L242623,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
37315,L242622,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,They won't break this one.
37316,L242621,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!"
37317,L242618,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,We have to stop the Germans now!
37318,L242617,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
37319,L242546,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,That this illness has clouded his mind.
37320,L242545,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Caesar?
37321,L242544,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed."
37322,L242543,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"You flatter me, Caesar."
37323,L242542,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
37324,L242514,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
37325,L242513,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"But they're not destroyed, not yet."
37326,L242508,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care."
37327,L242507,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
37328,L242500,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?"
37329,L242499,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician..."
37330,L242488,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
37331,L242487,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Gladly Caesar.
37332,L242486,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Then you'd be out of a job.
37333,L242471,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say."
37334,L242470,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"That's difficult to say, general."
37335,L242469,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
37336,L242443,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me."
37337,L242442,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report."
37338,L242441,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather."
37339,L242825,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,I wouldn't know who to bet on.
37340,L242824,u1157,m76,FALCO,"Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena."
37341,L242784,u1157,m76,FALCO,Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
37342,L242783,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Take grain away from the army?
37343,L242782,u1157,m76,FALCO,"Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube."
37344,L242781,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Give away food?
37345,L242780,u1157,m76,FALCO,We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
37346,L242779,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,So am I.
37347,L242778,u1157,m76,FALCO,I'm serious.
37348,L242777,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
37349,L242776,u1157,m76,FALCO,"Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea."
37350,L242775,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
37351,L242753,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship..."
37352,L242752,u1157,m76,FALCO,"And like children everywhere they scream ""freedom"" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar."
37353,L242707,u1157,m76,FALCO,Until your confirmation date.
37354,L242706,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
37355,L242703,u1157,m76,FALCO,At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
37356,L242702,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
37357,L242701,u1157,m76,FALCO,"Caesar, ignore them."
37358,L242656,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
37359,L242655,u1157,m76,FALCO,"The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you."
37360,L242643,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
37361,L242642,u1157,m76,FALCO,Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
37362,L243079,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it."
37363,L243078,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident."
37364,L243077,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,It's because he comes off as the underdog.
37365,L243073,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament."
37366,L243072,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
37367,L242620,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans."
37368,L242619,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
37369,L242611,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,He left us at dawn.
37370,L242610,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,Marcus Aurelius has died.
37371,L242445,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician."
37372,L242444,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light."
37373,L242999,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though..."
37374,L242998,u1168,m76,TRIBUUS,"Yes, Caesar."
37375,L242997,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia."
37376,L242846,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Jerses -- tomorrow...
37377,L242845,u1168,m76,TRIBUUS,"Yes, Caesar?"
37378,L242828,u1168,m76,TRIBUUS,"Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control..."
37379,L242827,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!"
37380,L242732,u1168,m76,TRIBUUS,He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
37381,L242731,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,"Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?"
37382,L242415,u1168,m76,TRIBUUS,"Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?"
37383,L242414,u1155,m76,COMMODUS,Where is my father?
37384,L243036,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
37385,L243035,u1156,m76,COS,I'll nose around...
37386,L243034,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
37387,L243033,u1156,m76,COS,I don't know...
37388,L243032,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!"
37389,L242953,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
37390,L242952,u1156,m76,COS,"""Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens.""  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition."
37391,L242742,u1156,m76,COS,"I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?"
37392,L242741,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you..."
37393,L242740,u1156,m76,COS,"You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate..."
37394,L243031,u1156,m76,COS,"Yes, because I know they'll read it."
37395,L243030,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
37396,L242943,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?"
37397,L242942,u1156,m76,COS,That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
37398,L242941,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know."
37399,L242940,u1156,m76,COS,The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
37400,L242939,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus."
37401,L242938,u1156,m76,COS,I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
37402,L242937,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action."
37403,L242936,u1156,m76,COS,"So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case..."
37404,L242485,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all."
37405,L242484,u1157,m76,FALCO,But have never been?
37406,L242483,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I've read of it.
37407,L242482,u1157,m76,FALCO,"You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years."
37408,L242481,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
37409,L242480,u1157,m76,FALCO,God of passages and changes?
37410,L242479,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors."
37411,L242646,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I hope you live to see what I believe...
37412,L242645,u1158,m76,GAIUS,"The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed."
37413,L242644,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,The Senate too?
37414,L242506,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"We all know what right is, Senator."
37415,L242505,u1158,m76,GAIUS,The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
37416,L242504,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
37417,L242475,u1158,m76,GAIUS,"Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?"
37418,L242474,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire."
37419,L242865,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,You don't know how wrong you are.
37420,L242864,u1159,m76,GRACCHUS,You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
37421,L242863,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
37422,L242862,u1159,m76,GRACCHUS,Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
37423,L242861,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
37424,L242860,u1159,m76,GRACCHUS,How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
37425,L242859,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,You're hearing about somebody else.
37426,L242858,u1159,m76,GRACCHUS,Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
37427,L242660,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,They can't... if this is Rome...
37428,L242659,u1160,m76,JUBA,Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
37429,L242652,u1160,m76,JUBA,That's what worries me...
37430,L242651,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
37431,L242650,u1160,m76,JUBA,My loyalties... were in doubt.
37432,L242649,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Why you?
37433,L242648,u1160,m76,JUBA,"You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?"
37434,L242919,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe."
37435,L242918,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Where are they?
37436,L242917,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them."
37437,L242916,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,He killed his father and then my family...
37438,L242915,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
37439,L242914,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Would that Marcus had lived.
37440,L242913,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,You cannot die.
37441,L242908,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"""But what if I wish to be purple?"""
37442,L242907,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"""If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."""
37443,L242906,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?"
37444,L242905,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters."
37445,L242902,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive."
37446,L242901,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!"
37447,L242899,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
37448,L242898,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
37449,L242897,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero."
37450,L242891,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Yours will do!
37451,L242890,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"It's my brother's neck you want, not mine."
37452,L242555,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful."
37453,L242554,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
37454,L242553,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,"How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?"
37455,L242552,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Why do you play at being drunk?
37456,L242551,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
37457,L242550,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
37458,L242549,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
37459,L242548,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Sneaking around with your brother?
37460,L242547,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
37461,L242459,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Only from a distance.
37462,L242458,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
37463,L242455,u1161,m76,LUCILLA,Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
37464,L242454,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day."
37465,L242537,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
37466,L242536,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic."
37467,L242535,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,They fear me.
37468,L242534,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,The Senators admire you.
37469,L242533,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me."
37470,L242532,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir."
37471,L242531,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide..."
37472,L242530,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?"
37473,L242529,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,So I understand.
37474,L242528,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate."
37475,L242527,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn."
37476,L242526,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!"
37477,L242525,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow."
37478,L242524,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,Servis made it through again?
37479,L242523,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
37480,L242522,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over."
37481,L242521,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself."
37482,L242520,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
37483,L242517,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!"
37484,L242516,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
37485,L242515,u1162,m76,MARCUS AURELIUS,"Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive."
37486,L242606,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,On my honor as your daddy...
37487,L242605,u1167,m76,THEMIS,"On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?"
37488,L242604,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,As soon as I can.
37489,L242603,u1167,m76,THEMIS,Tomorrow?
37490,L242602,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
37491,L242566,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented."
37492,L242565,u1167,m76,THEMIS,I made the plume from a quail feather.
37493,L243068,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
37494,L243067,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!"
37495,L243055,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!"
37496,L243054,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
37497,L243053,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!"
37498,L243052,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!"
37499,L243051,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired."
37500,L243050,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
37501,L243049,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,I was summoned.
37502,L243048,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,You brought the army into Rome.
37503,L242633,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,I can't let you do that.
37504,L242632,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort."
37505,L242629,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Well, they die for it!"
37506,L242628,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,My troops don't make policy.
37507,L242627,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
37508,L242626,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
37509,L242625,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,What deal?
37510,L242624,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
37511,L242616,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
37512,L242615,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,Serious stuff...
37513,L242449,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,"Well, we can try..."
37514,L242448,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
37515,L242447,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
37516,L242446,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,What the hell was all that about?
37517,L242428,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
37518,L242427,u1165,m76,QUINTUS,I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
37519,L243130,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
37520,L243129,u1166,m76,SELENE,You teach them!
37521,L243128,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!"
37522,L243127,u1166,m76,SELENE,Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
37523,L243126,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
37524,L243125,u1166,m76,SELENE,I don't want you to die!
37525,L243124,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
37526,L243123,u1166,m76,SELENE,Narcissus!
37527,L243122,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
37528,L243121,u1166,m76,SELENE,You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
37529,L243120,u1166,m76,SELENE,No!
37530,L243119,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia."
37531,L242598,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
37532,L242597,u1166,m76,SELENE,I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
37533,L242596,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other."
37534,L242595,u1166,m76,SELENE,I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
37535,L242594,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Quintus is overly idealistic.
37536,L242593,u1166,m76,SELENE,Let him trust Quintus.
37537,L242592,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me."
37538,L242591,u1166,m76,SELENE,We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
37539,L242590,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
37540,L242589,u1166,m76,SELENE,Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
37541,L242588,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
37542,L242586,u1166,m76,SELENE,"I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become."
37543,L242585,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,This is our oil from our estates?
37544,L242583,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines."
37545,L242582,u1166,m76,SELENE,The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
37546,L242581,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I can see that...
37547,L242580,u1166,m76,SELENE,You need to come home!
37548,L242578,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Of course...
37549,L242577,u1166,m76,SELENE,They're studying with Cynics.
37550,L242576,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,What about their philosophy lessons?
37551,L242570,u1166,m76,SELENE,Athenians...
37552,L242569,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Greeks?
37553,L242568,u1166,m76,SELENE,"Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers."
37554,L242564,u1166,m76,SELENE,Isn't the helmet magnificent?
37555,L242563,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,He's very realistic.
37556,L243117,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business."
37557,L243116,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
37558,L243098,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?"
37559,L243097,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I want nothing to do with the arena.
37560,L243096,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak."
37561,L243043,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,Was I?
37562,L243042,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?"
37563,L243041,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first."
37564,L243013,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!"
37565,L243012,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
37566,L243011,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Right, right, what am I thinking of?"
37567,L243010,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Before they leave, get gold."
37568,L243009,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this."
37569,L243008,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Then get a large cash advance.
37570,L243007,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
37571,L243006,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
37572,L243005,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
37573,L243004,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time..."
37574,L243003,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
37575,L243002,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,How much money is involved?
37576,L242977,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!"
37577,L242976,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
37578,L242975,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
37579,L242974,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?"
37580,L242972,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
37581,L242971,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?"
37582,L242970,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
37583,L242969,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home."
37584,L242968,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!"
37585,L242967,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'"
37586,L242966,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,You get to come alive again in the country!
37587,L242965,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?"
37588,L242964,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
37589,L242963,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"What the hell are you talking about, Greek?"
37590,L242962,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall."
37591,L242950,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich..."
37592,L242949,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
37593,L242935,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Lucky it didn't step on his head.
37594,L242934,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
37595,L242895,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,Don't be ridiculous.
37596,L242894,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin."
37597,L242885,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Alive... I'm alive...
37598,L242884,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you."
37599,L242851,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,Think about it!  Just think about it!
37600,L242850,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,"What would the poster say: ""Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"""
37601,L242849,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money..."
37602,L242739,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,That's one way to look at it.
37603,L242738,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
37604,L242737,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"General, do you realize what happened out there today?"
37605,L242714,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but..."
37606,L242713,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
37607,L242712,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!"
37608,L242693,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,-- to fight?  We'll see...
37609,L242692,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
37610,L242691,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
37611,L242690,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,Chain him.
37612,L242689,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Take your hands off me animal!
37613,L242682,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before."
37614,L242681,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Death is a very light thing for you.
37615,L242680,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight."
37616,L242679,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
37617,L242676,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
37618,L242675,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen."
37619,L242674,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
37620,L242673,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons."
37621,L242672,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,Who the hell are you?
37622,L242671,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,"I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend."
37623,L242670,u1163,m76,NARCISSUS,I killed too many barbarians.
37624,L242669,u1164,m76,PROXIMO,You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
37625,L251805,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
37626,L251804,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin?
37627,L251692,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
37628,L251691,u1169,m77,BEN,The day after tomorrow?
37629,L251690,u1172,m77,ELAINE,No.
37630,L251689,u1169,m77,BEN,Are we getting married tomorrow?
37631,L251686,u1169,m77,BEN,Where did he do it?
37632,L251685,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Shhhh.
37633,L251684,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no. He said that.
37634,L251683,u1172,m77,ELAINE,He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
37635,L251682,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well, what did he say? I'm curious."
37636,L251681,u1172,m77,ELAINE,"No, Benjamin."
37637,L251680,u1169,m77,BEN,"How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope."
37638,L251678,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Well -- I said I might marry him.
37639,L251677,u1169,m77,BEN,Why do you have to see him?
37640,L251676,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Yes.
37641,L251675,u1169,m77,BEN,Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
37642,L251674,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
37643,L251673,u1169,m77,BEN,Carl who?
37644,L251672,u1169,m77,BEN,Carl who?
37645,L251671,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Well -- I have to see Carl first.
37646,L251670,u1169,m77,BEN,Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
37647,L251669,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
37648,L251667,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I just don't think it would...
37649,L251666,u1169,m77,BEN,Why wouldn't it?
37650,L251665,u1169,m77,BEN,Why wouldn't it?
37651,L251664,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I just don't think it would work.
37652,L251663,u1169,m77,BEN,We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
37653,L251662,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
37654,L251661,u1169,m77,BEN,Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
37655,L251660,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Tomorrow?
37656,L251659,u1169,m77,BEN,We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
37657,L251654,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Yes.
37658,L251653,u1169,m77,BEN,You really will?
37659,L251652,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I'll think about it.
37660,L251651,u1169,m77,BEN,Elaine -- are you serious about this?
37661,L251650,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I have to go back now.
37662,L251649,u1169,m77,BEN,We just can.
37663,L251648,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't see how we can.
37664,L251647,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
37665,L251646,u1169,m77,BEN,You mean you're confused?
37666,L251645,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
37667,L251644,u1169,m77,BEN,How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
37668,L251643,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't know.
37669,L251642,u1169,m77,BEN,When?
37670,L251641,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Yes.
37671,L251640,u1169,m77,BEN,Is that so? You might marry me?
37672,L251639,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I might.
37673,L251638,u1169,m77,BEN,But you might.
37674,L251637,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't know.
37675,L251636,u1169,m77,BEN,You won't?
37676,L251634,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Will you kiss me!
37677,L251633,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
37678,L251632,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin?
37679,L251630,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Goodbye.
37680,L251629,u1169,m77,BEN,But Elaine --
37681,L251628,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
37682,L251627,u1169,m77,BEN,I don't understand.
37683,L251626,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
37684,L251624,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Well -- where are you going?
37685,L251623,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
37686,L251622,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Are you going home?
37687,L251621,u1169,m77,BEN,I don't know.
37688,L251620,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What are you going to do now?
37689,L251619,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Oh.
37690,L251618,u1169,m77,BEN,The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
37691,L251617,u1172,m77,ELAINE,The marble?
37692,L251616,u1169,m77,BEN,No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
37693,L251615,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Don't you have it on?
37694,L251614,u1169,m77,BEN,My belt.
37695,L251613,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What are you looking for?
37696,L251612,u1169,m77,BEN,If you want.
37697,L251611,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Can I just sit here while you're packing?
37698,L251610,u1169,m77,BEN,Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
37699,L251609,u1172,m77,ELAINE,"Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?"
37700,L251587,u1169,m77,BEN,-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
37701,L251586,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- this is my mother!
37702,L251585,u1169,m77,BEN,-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
37703,L251584,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Don't tell me --
37704,L251583,u1169,m77,BEN,All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
37705,L251582,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Please let me go.
37706,L251581,u1169,m77,BEN,Elaine -- that is not what happened.
37707,L251580,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
37708,L251579,u1169,m77,BEN,Then what?
37709,L251578,u1172,m77,ELAINE,She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
37710,L251576,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't feel well.
37711,L251575,u1169,m77,BEN,Because it isn't true.
37712,L251574,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Why?
37713,L251573,u1169,m77,BEN,You've got to tell me what she said.
37714,L251572,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Let me go.
37715,L251571,u1169,m77,BEN,What did she say?
37716,L251570,u1172,m77,ELAINE,-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
37717,L251569,u1169,m77,BEN,Did you say rape her?
37718,L251568,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't understand --
37719,L251567,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
37720,L251566,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
37721,L251565,u1172,m77,ELAINE,"How could you do that, Benjamin?"
37722,L251564,u1169,m77,BEN,Elaine -- I love you.
37723,L251563,u1172,m77,ELAINE,"Well, I want you to leave."
37724,L251562,u1169,m77,BEN,All right then! Yes!
37725,L251561,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I said I think it is.
37726,L251560,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I think it is.
37727,L251559,u1169,m77,BEN,What do you think?
37728,L251558,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Is it because I'm here?
37729,L251557,u1169,m77,BEN,Because -- I am.
37730,L251556,u1172,m77,ELAINE,No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?

37732,L251554,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I want to ask you a question.
37733,L251543,u1169,m77,BEN,I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
37734,L251542,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What?
37735,L251541,u1169,m77,BEN,Here he comes.
37736,L251540,u1172,m77,ELAINE,-- really incredible --
37737,L251539,u1169,m77,BEN,Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
37738,L251538,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
37739,L251537,u1169,m77,BEN,No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
37740,L251536,u1172,m77,ELAINE,But you're not enrolled.
37741,L251535,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --"
37742,L251534,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Yes.
37743,L251533,u1169,m77,BEN,Here? In Berkeley?
37744,L251532,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
37745,L251531,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh.
37746,L251530,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I thought he said by the monkey house.
37747,L251529,u1169,m77,BEN,Where did he say he was going to meet you?
37748,L251528,u1172,m77,ELAINE,No.
37749,L251527,u1169,m77,BEN,Is that him over there?
37750,L251526,u1169,m77,BEN,"Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you."
37751,L251525,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I've never been to it.
37752,L251524,u1169,m77,BEN,"The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?"
37753,L251523,u1172,m77,ELAINE,At the Zoo.
37754,L251522,u1169,m77,BEN,Where are you meeting this person?

37761,L251449,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Oh my God --
37762,L251448,u1169,m77,BEN,Elaine --
37763,L251444,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
37764,L251443,u1172,m77,ELAINE,You mean the one who --
37765,L251442,u1169,m77,BEN,That woman. The older woman.
37766,L251441,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What?
37767,L251440,u1169,m77,BEN,That woman --
37768,L251439,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What is it?
37769,L251436,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Because I want to know what's happening.
37770,L251435,u1169,m77,BEN,Why aren't you ready?
37771,L251433,u1169,m77,BEN,Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
37772,L251432,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- what's happening?
37773,L251431,u1169,m77,BEN,You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
37774,L251430,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What's the matter?
37775,L251407,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- I really do.
37776,L251406,u1169,m77,BEN,You do?
37777,L251405,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I do.
37778,L251404,u1169,m77,BEN,Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
37779,L251403,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Yes.
37780,L251402,u1169,m77,BEN,You sure you really want to?
37781,L251401,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Okay.
37782,L251400,u1169,m77,BEN,During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
37783,L251399,u1172,m77,ELAINE,All right.
37784,L251396,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I'm glad.

37786,L251394,u1172,m77,ELAINE,And it's all over now.
37787,L251393,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
37788,L251392,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Did they ever find out?
37789,L251391,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes. She had a husband and a son.
37790,L251390,u1172,m77,ELAINE,With a family?
37791,L251389,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes.
37792,L251388,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Was she married or something?
37793,L251387,u1169,m77,BEN,It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
37794,L251386,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I'm sorry. That is not my business.
37795,L251382,u1169,m77,BEN,You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
37796,L251381,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Yes.
37797,L251380,u1169,m77,BEN,Do you?
37798,L251377,u1169,m77,BEN,I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
37799,L251376,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
37800,L251372,u1169,m77,BEN,Of course not.
37801,L251371,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- do they know you?
37802,L251370,u1169,m77,BEN,"Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else."
37803,L251369,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin --
37804,L251363,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
37805,L251362,u1169,m77,BEN,"Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know."
37806,L251361,u1169,m77,BEN,Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
37807,L251360,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What is the matter?
37808,L251359,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
37809,L251358,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
37810,L251357,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Where we going?
37811,L251356,u1172,m77,ELAINE,All right.
37812,L251355,u1169,m77,BEN,No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
37813,L251354,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Is anything wrong?
37814,L251353,u1169,m77,BEN,Wait a minute.
37815,L251352,u1172,m77,ELAINE,We won't. Let's go inside.
37816,L251351,u1169,m77,BEN,"No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up."
37817,L251350,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
37818,L251345,u1172,m77,ELAINE,"Yes, I do."
37819,L251344,u1169,m77,BEN,I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
37820,L251341,u1172,m77,ELAINE,No.
37821,L251340,u1169,m77,BEN,But could you try?
37822,L251339,u1172,m77,ELAINE,"No, I couldn't."
37823,L251338,u1169,m77,BEN,"Listen -- could you stop crying, please?"
37824,L251337,u1169,m77,BEN,No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
37825,L251336,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
37826,L251335,u1169,m77,BEN,This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
37827,L251334,u1172,m77,ELAINE,What?
37828,L251333,u1169,m77,BEN,But could I just tell you this one thing?
37829,L251332,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I want to go home.
37830,L251331,u1169,m77,BEN,I just want to tell you something.
37831,L251330,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Where is the car?
37832,L251329,u1169,m77,BEN,"But, Elaine --"
37833,L251328,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I think I'd better go home now please.
37834,L251327,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm sorry I took you in there.
37835,L251326,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Will you take me home now?
37836,L251323,u1172,m77,ELAINE,No.
37837,L251322,u1169,m77,BEN,Could you do it?
37838,L251319,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I don't know.
37839,L251318,u1169,m77,BEN,No -- why should I?
37840,L251317,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
37841,L251313,u1169,m77,BEN,"If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry."
37842,L251312,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Why not?
37843,L251311,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
37844,L251310,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Aren't you eating?
37845,L251306,u1172,m77,ELAINE,I'd love some.
37846,L251305,u1169,m77,BEN,Do you want some dinner?
37847,L251304,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes.

37849,L251302,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
37850,L251301,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Are you going to graduate school?
37851,L251300,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
37852,L251299,u1172,m77,ELAINE,Do you know what you're going to do?
37853,L251298,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes.
37854,L251297,u1172,m77,ELAINE,You're living at home now. Is that right?

37859,L251780,u1182,m77,WOMAN'S VOICE,Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
37860,L251779,u1169,m77,BEN,Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
37861,L251778,u1182,m77,WOMAN'S VOICE,"Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --"

37896,L251591,u1169,m77,BEN,"It's all right, Mr. McCleery."
37897,L251590,u1174,m77,MR. MCCLEERY,Who screamed?

37928,L250724,u1179,m77,MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE,Will you bring it in to me?
37929,L250723,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm putting it here by the door.
37930,L250722,u1179,m77,MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE,"For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?"
37931,L250721,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm putting it on the top step.
37932,L250720,u1179,m77,MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE,Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.

37934,L250718,u1169,m77,BEN,Well I'll hand it to you.
37935,L250717,u1179,m77,MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE,Could you bring it up?
37936,L250716,u1169,m77,BEN,Well here's the purse.
37937,L250715,u1179,m77,MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE,I'm in the bathroom.
37938,L250714,u1169,m77,BEN,Mrs. Robinson?
37939,L250710,u1169,m77,BEN,I have to go now. I'm sorry.
37940,L250709,u1179,m77,MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE,Will you bring up my purse before you go?
37941,L250708,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes.
37942,L250707,u1179,m77,MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE,BENJAMIN?
37943,L250910,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,"Whatever you say, sir."
37944,L250909,u1169,m77,BEN,"Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself."
37945,L250908,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,I'll have a porter show you the room.
37946,L250907,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,Of course.
37947,L250906,u1169,m77,BEN,I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
37948,L250905,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,Sir?
37949,L250904,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no.
37950,L250903,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,"Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in."
37951,L250902,u1169,m77,BEN,Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
37952,L250901,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,Where is your luggage?
37953,L250900,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
37954,L250899,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,Where is it?
37955,L250898,u1169,m77,BEN,Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
37956,L250897,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,"Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?"
37957,L250896,u1169,m77,BEN,What? No. Nothing.
37958,L250895,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,"Is anything wrong, sir?"
37959,L250894,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,"Will you sign the register, please?"
37960,L250893,u1169,m77,BEN,"A single. Just for myself, please."
37961,L250892,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,A single room or a double room?
37962,L250891,u1169,m77,BEN,"A room. I'd like a room, please."
37963,L250890,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,Yes sir?
37964,L250837,u1169,m77,BEN,Ahh -- thank you.
37965,L250836,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,It's in the main ballroom.
37966,L250835,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
37967,L250834,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,"The Singleman party, sir?"
37968,L250833,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
37969,L250831,u1169,m77,BEN,What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
37970,L250830,u1181,m77,ROOM CLERK,"Can I help you, sir!"
37971,L251748,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I don't think so.
37972,L251747,u1169,m77,BEN,I'll find her.
37973,L251746,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
37974,L251745,u1169,m77,BEN,What the hell have you done?
37975,L251744,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --"
37976,L251743,u1169,m77,BEN,"You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her."
37977,L251742,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?"
37978,L251741,u1169,m77,BEN,What have you done to her?
37979,L251740,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you."
37980,L251739,u1169,m77,BEN,Where is Elaine?
37981,L251738,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Hello. Get me the police, please."
37982,L251422,u1169,m77,BEN,I just don't believe you would do that.
37983,L251421,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Go home now.
37984,L251420,u1169,m77,BEN,"Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it."
37985,L251419,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Then you'd better start believing me.
37986,L251418,u1169,m77,BEN,I don't believe you.
37987,L251417,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
37988,L251416,u1169,m77,BEN,How?
37989,L251415,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I can makes things quite unpleasant.
37990,L251414,u1169,m77,BEN,Mrs. Robinson --
37991,L251413,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?"
37992,L251412,u1169,m77,BEN,Now it seems to me --
37993,L251411,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do exactly what I say.
37994,L251410,u1169,m77,BEN,Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
37995,L251409,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Drive down the block.
37996,L251288,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin."
37997,L251287,u1169,m77,BEN,"Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it."
37998,L251286,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
37999,L251285,u1169,m77,BEN,Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
38000,L251266,u1169,m77,BEN,Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
38001,L251265,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you.  Benjamin --
38002,L251264,u1169,m77,BEN,"All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson."
38003,L251263,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Promise me, Benjamin."
38004,L251262,u1169,m77,BEN,This is absurd.
38005,L251261,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Then give me your word you won't.
38006,L251260,u1169,m77,BEN,Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
38007,L251258,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well don't thank me, because I want you to."
38008,L251257,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you.
38009,L251256,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes. Please. I want you to.
38010,L251255,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,May I stay then?
38011,L251254,u1169,m77,BEN,Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
38012,L251253,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,You don't have to say that.
38013,L251252,u1169,m77,BEN,It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
38014,L251251,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,But if it's sickening for you --
38015,L251250,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
38016,L251249,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
38017,L251248,u1169,m77,BEN,But it's not.
38018,L251247,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,If that's how you feel --
38019,L251246,u1169,m77,BEN,Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
38020,L251245,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
38021,L251244,u1169,m77,BEN,What are you doing?
38022,L251243,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Of course I wouldn't.
38023,L251242,u1169,m77,BEN,You wouldn't.
38024,L251241,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
38025,L251240,u1169,m77,BEN,Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
38026,L251239,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got."
38027,L251238,u1169,m77,BEN,Of course you did.
38028,L251237,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Did I say that?
38029,L251236,u1169,m77,BEN,"Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter."
38030,L251235,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
38031,L251234,u1169,m77,BEN,Don't start acting hurt.
38032,L251233,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38033,L251232,u1169,m77,BEN,Now don't start this.
38034,L251231,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
38035,L251229,u1169,m77,BEN,You're goddamn right I am.
38036,L251228,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Are you?
38037,L251227,u1169,m77,BEN,"Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out."
38038,L251226,u1169,m77,BEN,"And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong."
38039,L251225,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I see.
38040,L251224,u1169,m77,BEN,No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
38041,L251223,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,You're not.
38042,L251222,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well, I'm not."
38043,L251221,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I wouldn't know.
38044,L251220,u1169,m77,BEN,"You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?"
38045,L251219,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes.
38046,L251218,u1169,m77,BEN,"I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?"
38047,L251217,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin?
38048,L251216,u1169,m77,BEN,"We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --"
38049,L251215,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Let's drop it.
38050,L251214,u1169,m77,BEN,"I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?"
38051,L251213,u1169,m77,BEN,"Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are."
38052,L251212,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No.
38053,L251211,u1169,m77,BEN,Then let's hear them.
38054,L251210,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I have my reasons.
38055,L251209,u1169,m77,BEN,But why shouldn't I?
38056,L251208,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Good.
38057,L251207,u1169,m77,BEN,I was just kidding around.
38058,L251206,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Good.
38059,L251205,u1169,m77,BEN,Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
38060,L251204,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you understand that?
38061,L251203,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out."
38062,L251202,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
38063,L251201,u1169,m77,BEN,Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
38064,L251200,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,There's nothing to tell.
38065,L251199,u1169,m77,BEN,I wish you'd tell me.
38066,L251197,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Because I don't want you to.
38067,L251196,u1169,m77,BEN,Why not?
38068,L251195,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No.
38069,L251194,u1169,m77,BEN,Don't talk about Elaine?
38070,L251193,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Don't talk about Elaine.
38071,L251192,u1169,m77,BEN,So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
38072,L251191,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,That's enough.
38073,L251190,u1169,m77,BEN,"A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!"
38074,L251189,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"It was a Ford, Benjamin."
38075,L251188,u1169,m77,BEN,Really. I want to know.
38076,L251187,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Oh my God.
38077,L251186,u1169,m77,BEN,Do you remember the make of the car?
38078,L251185,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38079,L251184,u1169,m77,BEN,What kind of car was it?
38080,L251183,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I don't think we were the first.
38081,L251182,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no. In the car you did it?
38082,L251181,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,We'd go to his car.
38083,L251180,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm curious.
38084,L251179,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?"
38085,L251178,u1169,m77,BEN,I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
38086,L251177,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,How do you think.
38087,L251176,u1169,m77,BEN,Well how did it happen?
38088,L251175,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Kind of.
38089,L251174,u1169,m77,BEN,But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
38090,L251173,u1169,m77,BEN,Art?
38091,L251172,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Art.
38092,L251171,u1169,m77,BEN,"Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?"
38093,L251170,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Why are you asking me all this?
38094,L251169,u1169,m77,BEN,What was your major?
38095,L251168,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes.
38096,L251167,u1169,m77,BEN,At college.
38097,L251166,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes.
38098,L251165,u1169,m77,BEN,And you were a student also.
38099,L251164,u1169,m77,BEN,Was he a law student at the time?
38100,L251163,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Not particularly.
38101,L251162,u1169,m77,BEN,I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
38102,L251161,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38103,L251160,u1169,m77,BEN,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
38104,L251159,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,All right. Now let's get to bed.
38105,L251158,u1169,m77,BEN,Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
38106,L251157,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Are you shocked?
38107,L251156,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
38108,L251155,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Don't tell Elaine.
38109,L251154,u1169,m77,BEN,"I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?"
38110,L251153,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Think real hard, Benjamin."
38111,L251152,u1169,m77,BEN,Well I can't.
38112,L251151,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,See if you can guess.
38113,L251150,u1169,m77,BEN,Why did you do that?
38114,L251149,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well, wait a minute. You married him."
38115,L251148,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --"
38116,L251147,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38117,L251146,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No.
38118,L251145,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him."
38119,L251144,u1169,m77,BEN,I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
38120,L251143,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Is it?
38121,L251142,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?"
38122,L251141,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I don't.
38123,L251140,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well how do you feel about him, then?"
38124,L251139,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse."
38125,L251138,u1169,m77,BEN,But you don't hate him.
38126,L251137,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Not exactly.
38127,L251136,u1169,m77,BEN,Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
38128,L251135,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"We've talked enough, Benjamin."
38129,L251134,u1169,m77,BEN,So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
38130,L251133,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Is it?
38131,L251132,u1169,m77,BEN,"Man, is this interesting."
38132,L251131,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
38133,L251130,u1169,m77,BEN,How many times a year.
38134,L251129,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
38135,L251128,u1169,m77,BEN,You have not slept with your husband for five years?
38136,L251127,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No.
38137,L251126,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no. Are you kidding me?
38138,L251125,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,About five years.
38139,L251124,u1169,m77,BEN,Well how long has this been going on.
38140,L251123,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No we don't.
38141,L251122,u1169,m77,BEN,So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
38142,L251121,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,We don't.
38143,L251120,u1169,m77,BEN,Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
38144,L251119,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you.
38145,L251118,u1169,m77,BEN,Right.
38146,L251117,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Can I undress and talk at the same time?
38147,L251116,u1169,m77,BEN,Now let's keep going here.
38148,L251115,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Calm down, Benjamin."
38149,L251114,u1169,m77,BEN,"We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking."
38150,L251113,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38151,L251112,u1169,m77,BEN,We're talking.
38152,L251111,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,The driveway's on my side of the house.
38153,L251110,u1169,m77,BEN,But what about the noise from the car. What if --
38154,L251109,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
38155,L251108,u1169,m77,BEN,Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
38156,L251107,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic."
38157,L251106,u1169,m77,BEN,Always?
38158,L251105,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,He's asleep.
38159,L251104,u1169,m77,BEN,What do you say to him?
38160,L251103,u1169,m77,BEN,You walk right out the door.
38161,L251102,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I walk out.
38162,L251101,u1169,m77,BEN,How do you get out of the house?
38163,L251100,u1169,m77,BEN,There's no risk?
38164,L251099,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,There isn't any.
38165,L251098,u1169,m77,BEN,I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
38166,L251097,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Him?
38167,L251096,u1169,m77,BEN,Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
38168,L251095,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38169,L251094,u1169,m77,BEN,There!
38170,L251093,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
38171,L251092,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I don't remember.
38172,L251091,u1169,m77,BEN,What novel did you read.
38173,L251090,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38174,L251089,u1169,m77,BEN,What one.
38175,L251088,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
38176,L251087,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
38177,L251086,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you want to hear it or not?
38178,L251085,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I got up.
38179,L251084,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes I do.
38180,L251083,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you really want me to?
38181,L251082,u1169,m77,BEN,No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
38182,L251081,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Can I take off my clothes now?
38183,L251080,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I don't.
38184,L251079,u1169,m77,BEN,Then why do you want to talk about it?
38185,L251078,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No.
38186,L251077,u1169,m77,BEN,You're not interested in art?
38187,L251076,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Neither.
38188,L251075,u1169,m77,BEN,Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
38189,L251074,u1169,m77,BEN,Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
38190,L251073,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Go ahead then.
38191,L251072,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
38192,L251071,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Don't you?
38193,L251070,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh.
38194,L251069,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
38195,L251068,u1169,m77,BEN,Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
38196,L251067,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,How about art.
38197,L251066,u1169,m77,BEN,Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
38198,L251065,u1169,m77,BEN,Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
38199,L251064,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Well?
38200,L251063,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh my God.
38201,L251062,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
38202,L251061,u1169,m77,BEN,Anything. Anything at all.
38203,L251060,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Well what do you want to talk about?
38204,L251059,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
38205,L251058,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Are you tired of it?
38206,L251057,u1169,m77,BEN,All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
38207,L251056,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
38208,L251055,u1169,m77,BEN,Good. I mean are we dead or something?
38209,L251054,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,If you want.
38210,L251053,u1169,m77,BEN,Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
38211,L250992,u1169,m77,BEN,INADEQUATE!
38212,L250991,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
38213,L250990,u1169,m77,BEN,Wait a minute.
38214,L250989,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,That you're afraid --
38215,L250988,u1169,m77,BEN,Who said it was my first time?
38216,L250987,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,On your first time --
38217,L250986,u1169,m77,BEN,Wait a minute!
38218,L250985,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,It's nothing to be ashamed of --
38219,L250984,u1169,m77,BEN,Are you kidding?
38220,L250983,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"You can admit that, can't you?"
38221,L250982,u1169,m77,BEN,"That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha."
38222,L250981,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"It is, isn't it? It is your first time."
38223,L250980,u1169,m77,BEN,Is this -- what?
38224,L250979,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Benjamin, is this your first time?"
38225,L250978,u1169,m77,BEN,"No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie."
38226,L250977,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Are you afraid of me?
38227,L250976,u1169,m77,BEN,"Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --"
38228,L250975,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
38229,L250974,u1169,m77,BEN,This is all terribly wrong.
38230,L250973,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,You what?
38231,L250972,u1169,m77,BEN,Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
38232,L250971,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Would this be easier for you in the dark?
38233,L250970,u1169,m77,BEN,You're welcome.
38234,L250969,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you.
38235,L250966,u1169,m77,BEN,Okay.
38236,L250965,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Either one will be fine.
38237,L250964,u1169,m77,BEN,Wood or wire? They have both.
38238,L250963,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38239,L250962,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh -- yes. Wood?
38240,L250961,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,A hanger.
38241,L250960,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38242,L250959,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Will you bring me a hanger?
38243,L250958,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh -- sure. Thank you.
38244,L250957,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Why don't you watch?
38245,L250956,u1169,m77,BEN,Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
38246,L250955,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
38247,L250954,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes?
38248,L250953,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin.
38249,L250952,u1169,m77,BEN,Well.
38250,L250943,u1169,m77,BEN,"You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson."
38251,L250942,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you.
38252,L250941,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
38253,L250940,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that."
38254,L250939,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38255,L250938,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,The number.
38256,L250937,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
38257,L250936,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes.
38258,L250935,u1169,m77,BEN,To tell you?
38259,L250934,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Isn't there something you want to tell me?
38260,L250933,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes?
38261,L250932,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin.
38262,L250931,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- goodbye then --
38263,L250930,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I'll be up in five minutes.
38264,L250929,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes -- I think that would be good.
38265,L250928,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Well -- do you want to go up first?
38266,L250927,u1169,m77,BEN,But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
38267,L250926,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,That's fine.
38268,L250925,u1169,m77,BEN,I got a single room.
38269,L250889,u1169,m77,BEN,Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
38270,L250888,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Why don't you get it.
38271,L250887,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- I don't know.
38272,L250886,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes.
38273,L250885,u1169,m77,BEN,Now?
38274,L250884,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you want to get it now?
38275,L250883,u1169,m77,BEN,You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
38276,L250882,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you want me to get it?
38277,L250881,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
38278,L250880,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you want to?
38279,L250879,u1169,m77,BEN,I haven't. No.
38280,L250878,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Have you gotten us a room yet?
38281,L250877,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38282,L250876,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Did you get us a room?
38283,L250875,u1169,m77,BEN,"Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --"
38284,L250874,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"You don't have to be so nervous, you know."
38285,L250871,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Waiter!
38286,L250870,u1169,m77,BEN,He didn't see me.
38287,L250869,u1169,m77,BEN,A drink? Of course.
38288,L250868,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,May I have a drink?
38289,L250867,u1169,m77,BEN,Very well. Thank you.
38290,L250866,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,How are you?
38291,L250864,u1169,m77,BEN,Of course.
38292,L250863,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,May I sit down?
38293,L250862,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh. Hello. Hello.
38294,L250861,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Hello, Benjamin."
38295,L250792,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you for taking me home.
38296,L250791,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes.
38297,L250790,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin?
38298,L250780,u1169,m77,BEN,I've got to go.
38299,L250779,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Yes, I do."
38300,L250740,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Because I find you very attractive and any time --
38301,L250739,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes. Yes. Let me out!
38302,L250738,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Do you understand what I said?
38303,L250737,u1169,m77,BEN,Let me out!
38304,L250736,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement."
38305,L250735,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh my God.
38306,L250734,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
38307,L250733,u1169,m77,BEN,Jesus Christ!
38308,L250732,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I want to say something first.
38309,L250731,u1169,m77,BEN,Get away from that door.
38310,L250730,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Don't be nervous.
38311,L250713,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,On that chair in the hall.
38312,L250712,u1169,m77,BEN,Where is it?
38313,L250711,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
38314,L250706,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
38315,L250705,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Is that what you're trying to tell me?
38316,L250704,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38317,L250703,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Would you like me to seduce you?
38318,L250702,u1169,m77,BEN,Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
38319,L250701,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Why is it?
38320,L250700,u1169,m77,BEN,"I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me."
38321,L250699,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
38322,L250698,u1169,m77,BEN,But they would! Don't you see?
38323,L250697,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
38324,L250696,u1169,m77,BEN,Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
38325,L250695,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Don't you think he trusts us together?
38326,L250694,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?"
38327,L250693,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What if he did?
38328,L250692,u1169,m77,BEN,But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
38329,L250691,u1169,m77,BEN,"Yes, I have --"
38330,L250690,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
38331,L250689,u1169,m77,BEN,Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
38332,L250688,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Then why do you keep running away?
38333,L250687,u1169,m77,BEN,"I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson."
38334,L250686,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What are you so scared of?
38335,L250685,u1169,m77,BEN,Right.
38336,L250684,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you.
38337,L250682,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Come on.
38338,L250681,u1169,m77,BEN,I know that. But I'm --
38339,L250680,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
38340,L250679,u1169,m77,BEN,"No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny."
38341,L250678,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
38342,L250677,u1169,m77,BEN,"I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson."
38343,L250676,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Won't you unzip my dress?
38344,L250675,u1169,m77,BEN,"Oh. Well, goodnight."
38345,L250674,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I think I'll go to bed.
38346,L250673,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Will you unzip my dress?
38347,L250672,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes?
38348,L250671,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin?
38349,L250670,u1169,m77,BEN,I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
38350,L250668,u1169,m77,BEN,Very much.
38351,L250667,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
38352,L250666,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
38353,L250665,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes.
38354,L250664,u1169,m77,BEN,Her portrait?
38355,L250663,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
38356,L250662,u1169,m77,BEN,What is wrong with me?
38357,L250661,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
38358,L250660,u1169,m77,BEN,"Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you."
38359,L250659,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,All right. Now finish your drink.
38360,L250658,u1169,m77,BEN,Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
38361,L250657,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Sit down.
38362,L250656,u1169,m77,BEN,"It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone."
38363,L250655,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,It's all right.
38364,L250654,u1169,m77,BEN,"Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?"
38365,L250653,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
38366,L250652,u1169,m77,BEN,Aren't you?
38367,L250651,u1169,m77,BEN,Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
38368,L250650,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,So?
38369,L250649,u1169,m77,BEN,"For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours."
38370,L250648,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Well I don't know.
38371,L250647,u1169,m77,BEN,What do you think?
38372,L250646,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Like what?
38373,L250645,u1169,m77,BEN,I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
38374,L250644,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What?
38375,L250643,u1169,m77,BEN,"Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --"
38376,L250642,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What's wrong?
38377,L250641,u1169,m77,BEN,"Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no."
38378,L250640,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Pardon?
38379,L250639,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh my God.
38380,L250637,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,My husband will be back quite late.
38381,L250636,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38382,L250635,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No.
38383,L250634,u1169,m77,BEN,Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
38384,L250633,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Sit down, Benjamin."
38385,L250632,u1169,m77,BEN,Look -- I think I should be going --
38386,L250631,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Did you know that?
38387,L250630,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38388,L250629,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Did you know I was an alcoholic?
38389,L250628,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
38390,L250627,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
38391,L250626,u1169,m77,BEN,What do you mean?
38392,L250625,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What do you think of me?
38393,L250623,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I'm very neurotic.
38394,L250622,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?"
38395,L250621,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes.
38396,L250620,u1169,m77,BEN,Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
38397,L250619,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
38398,L250618,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Drink?
38399,L250617,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I don't know.
38400,L250616,u1169,m77,BEN,When is he coming back?
38401,L250615,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Please wait till my husband gets home.
38402,L250614,u1169,m77,BEN,Why not?
38403,L250613,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house."
38404,L250612,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What do you drink?
38405,L250611,u1169,m77,BEN,All right then.
38406,L250610,u1169,m77,BEN,Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
38407,L250609,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,What do you drink? Bourbon?
38408,L250608,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Please.
38409,L250607,u1169,m77,BEN,But it's light in there now.
38410,L250606,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
38411,L250605,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
38412,L250604,u1169,m77,BEN,What for?
38413,L250603,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
38414,L250602,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38415,L250601,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Will you come in, please?"
38416,L250600,u1169,m77,BEN,Right.
38417,L250599,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Thank you.
38418,L250596,u1169,m77,BEN,Let's go.
38419,L250595,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,No.
38420,L250594,u1169,m77,BEN,You don't?
38421,L250591,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
38422,L250590,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38423,L250589,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Will you take me home?
38424,L250588,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38425,L250587,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Benjamin, I want to ask you something."
38426,L250586,u1169,m77,BEN,That's right.
38427,L250585,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,In general.
38428,L250584,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
38429,L250583,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Whatever it is you're upset about.
38430,L250582,u1169,m77,BEN,Is what a girl?
38431,L250581,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Is it a girl?
38432,L250580,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
38433,L250579,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
38434,L250578,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Is there an ashtray in here?
38435,L250576,u1169,m77,BEN,"Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall."
38436,L250575,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"How are you, Benjamin?"
38437,L250574,u1169,m77,BEN,It's down the hall.
38438,L250573,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?"
38439,L250950,u1171,m77,CLERK,"Goodnight, sir."
38440,L250949,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes. Well -- goodnight.
38441,L250948,u1171,m77,CLERK,"Very good, sir."
38442,L250947,u1169,m77,BEN,The toothbrush. I got it all right.
38443,L250946,u1171,m77,CLERK,Sir?
38444,L250945,u1169,m77,BEN,I say I've got it.
38445,L250858,u1180,m77,MRS. SINGLEMAN,Hey -- I don't get it.
38446,L250857,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
38447,L250856,u1180,m77,MRS. SINGLEMAN,I'm afraid I don't understand.
38448,L250855,u1169,m77,BEN,No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
38449,L250854,u1180,m77,MRS. SINGLEMAN,I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
38450,L250853,u1169,m77,BEN,"Yes, but I'm afraid --"
38451,L250852,u1180,m77,MRS. SINGLEMAN,Braddock -- Braddock?
38452,L250842,u1180,m77,MRS. SINGLEMAN,"I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --"
38453,L250841,u1169,m77,BEN,No -- actually I'm not --
38454,L251478,u1169,m77,BEN,We haven't.
38455,L251477,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,When did you two talk this over?
38456,L251472,u1169,m77,BEN,About an hour ago.
38457,L251471,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Well -- when did you decide all this?
38458,L251470,u1169,m77,BEN,No -- they don't.
38459,L251469,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,They don't know?
38460,L251466,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,"Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --"
38461,L251465,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm going up to Berkeley today.
38462,L251278,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
38463,L251277,u1169,m77,BEN,I do.
38464,L251276,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
38465,L251270,u1169,m77,BEN,"Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life."
38466,L251269,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
38467,L251048,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Goodnight.
38468,L251047,u1169,m77,BEN,But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
38469,L251046,u1169,m77,BEN,You don't?
38470,L251045,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,No.
38471,L251044,u1169,m77,BEN,"You believe me, don't you?"
38472,L251043,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,"Goodnight, Benjamin."
38473,L251042,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
38474,L251041,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,But I don't want you to make up something.
38475,L251040,u1169,m77,BEN,I do.
38476,L251039,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Not if you don't want to.
38477,L251038,u1169,m77,BEN,"Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?"
38478,L251037,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
38479,L251036,u1169,m77,BEN,Well why do you -- why do you think that?
38480,L251034,u1169,m77,BEN,"Well, wait."
38481,L251033,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,"Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin."
38482,L251032,u1169,m77,BEN,"I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?"
38483,L251031,u1169,m77,BEN,No wait. Wait.
38484,L251030,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,"Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --"
38485,L251029,u1169,m77,BEN,Why did you say that?
38486,L251028,u1169,m77,BEN,Meet someone?
38487,L251027,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
38488,L251026,u1169,m77,BEN,"Oh, no."
38489,L251025,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,"Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin."
38490,L251024,u1169,m77,BEN,Nothing else.
38491,L251023,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,What else?
38492,L251022,u1169,m77,BEN,I drive around.
38493,L251021,u1169,m77,BEN,"No, I do. I want to tell you."
38494,L251020,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
38495,L251019,u1169,m77,BEN,When I go off?
38496,L251018,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
38497,L251017,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38498,L251016,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
38499,L251015,u1169,m77,BEN,Sure.
38500,L251014,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Can I talk to you a minute?
38501,L251012,u1169,m77,BEN,"Hello, Mrs. Robinson."
38502,L251011,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,"Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin."
38503,L251480,u1169,m77,BEN,No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
38504,L251479,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
38505,L251476,u1169,m77,BEN,No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
38506,L251475,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
38507,L251474,u1169,m77,BEN,No. She doesn't know about it.
38508,L251473,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
38509,L251468,u1169,m77,BEN,No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
38510,L251467,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate."
38511,L251459,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
38512,L251458,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,Say that again.
38513,L251275,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
38514,L251274,u1169,m77,BEN,That has nothing to do with it --
38515,L251273,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable."
38516,L251272,u1169,m77,BEN,Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
38517,L251271,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?"
38518,L251004,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass."
38519,L251003,u1169,m77,BEN,You got me.
38520,L251002,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
38521,L251001,u1169,m77,BEN,No.
38522,L251000,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,Have you thought about graduate school?
38523,L250999,u1169,m77,BEN,Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
38524,L250998,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,Why?
38525,L250528,u1169,m77,BEN,Different.
38526,L250527,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,To be what?
38527,L250526,u1169,m77,BEN,I don't know. I want it to be --
38528,L250525,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,What about it?
38529,L250524,u1169,m77,BEN,I guess -- about my future.
38530,L250523,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,About what?
38531,L250522,u1169,m77,BEN,Well --
38532,L250521,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,-- worried?
38533,L250520,u1169,m77,BEN,I'm just --
38534,L251719,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure..."
38535,L251718,u1169,m77,BEN,HUH?
38536,L251717,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --"
38537,L251716,u1169,m77,BEN,"The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir."
38538,L251715,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Don't shout at me, Ben."
38539,L251714,u1169,m77,BEN,You miss the point.
38540,L251713,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?"
38541,L251712,u1169,m77,BEN,Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
38542,L251711,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,That's quite a statement.
38543,L251710,u1169,m77,BEN,It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
38544,L251709,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Why?
38545,L251708,u1169,m77,BEN,But why?
38546,L251707,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon."
38547,L251706,u1169,m77,BEN,"No, I don't."
38548,L251705,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?"
38549,L251704,u1169,m77,BEN,"I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you."
38550,L251703,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while."
38551,L251702,u1169,m77,BEN,I am not threatening you.
38552,L251701,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?"
38553,L251700,u1169,m77,BEN,Now look -- please --
38554,L251699,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me."
38555,L251698,u1169,m77,BEN,"It was nothing to do with you, sir."
38556,L251697,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
38557,L251696,u1169,m77,BEN,"No, it's not --"
38558,L251695,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
38559,L251694,u1169,m77,BEN,Mr. Robinson?
38560,L251693,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
38561,L251283,u1169,m77,BEN,Yes.
38562,L251282,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
38563,L251281,u1169,m77,BEN,Hello.
38564,L251010,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
38565,L251009,u1169,m77,BEN,I will.
38566,L251008,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time."
38567,L251007,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
38568,L251006,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?"
38569,L250789,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Great.
38570,L250788,u1169,m77,BEN,I will.
38571,L250787,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
38572,L250786,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh yes.
38573,L250785,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
38574,L250783,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
38575,L250782,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no.
38576,L250781,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
38577,L250775,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
38578,L250774,u1169,m77,BEN,I'd like to hear it.
38579,L250773,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
38580,L250772,u1169,m77,BEN,Thank you.
38581,L250771,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
38582,L250770,u1169,m77,BEN,"Yes, sir."
38583,L250769,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"I've watched you grow up, Ben."
38584,L250768,u1169,m77,BEN,Quite a while.
38585,L250767,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
38586,L250766,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,How long have we known each other now?
38587,L250765,u1169,m77,BEN,What?
38588,L250764,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Ben, can I say something to you?"
38589,L250763,u1169,m77,BEN,I know.
38590,L250762,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,You'll never be young again.
38591,L250761,u1169,m77,BEN,Sir?
38592,L250760,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --"
38593,L250759,u1169,m77,BEN,Thank you.
38594,L250758,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,That's a hell of a good age to be.
38595,L250757,u1169,m77,BEN,Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
38596,L250756,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Ben -- how old are you now?
38597,L250755,u1169,m77,BEN,"Thank you very much, sir."
38598,L250753,u1169,m77,BEN,No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
38599,L250752,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
38600,L250751,u1169,m77,BEN,I've got to go.
38601,L250750,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,What?
38602,L250749,u1169,m77,BEN,Oh no.
38603,L250748,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Here. It looks like you need a refill.
38604,L250747,u1169,m77,BEN,"Yes, sir."
38605,L250746,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,"Standing guard over the old castle, are you?"
38606,L250745,u1169,m77,BEN,She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
38607,L250744,u1176,m77,MR. ROBINSON,Swell. I appreciate it.
38608,L250743,u1169,m77,BEN,I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
38609,L250924,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,"Yes, I can."
38610,L250923,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,Can you see me now?
38611,L250922,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,Can you look through the glass.
38612,L250921,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Benjamin -- where are you?
38613,L250920,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,Benjamin Braddock.
38614,L250919,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes?
38615,L250918,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,It's Benjamin.
38616,L250917,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Yes?
38617,L250916,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,Mrs. Robinson?
38618,L250915,u1178,m77,MRS. ROBINSON,Hello.
38619,L250814,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
38620,L250813,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,Dad -- can you listen --
38621,L250812,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them."
38622,L250811,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
38623,L250810,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,I'd like to discuss this.
38624,L250809,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here."
38625,L250806,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --"
38626,L250805,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
38627,L250797,u1170,m77,BEN'S VOICE,"Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?"
38628,L250796,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,"Are you ready in there, feature attraction?"
38629,L251464,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,That what he says. Right?
38630,L251463,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,I don't believe it.
38631,L251462,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
38632,L251461,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,What's happening?
38633,L250534,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
38634,L250533,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,They came all the way from Tarzana.
38635,L250532,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,They are?  Come on.
38636,L250531,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,The Carlsons' are here.
38637,L250530,u1173,m77,MR. BRADDOCK,No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
38638,L250529,u1177,m77,MRS. BRADDOCK,Is anything wrong?
38639,L254011,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --"
38640,L254010,u1183,m78,A MAN,It's a short life and a gay one...
38641,L254009,u1183,m78,A MAN,Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
38642,L254008,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life."
38643,L254007,u1183,m78,A MAN,Splendid!
38644,L254006,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!"
38645,L253998,u1183,m78,A MAN,"Your bank, Mr. Kringelein."
38646,L253997,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
38647,L253978,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I --"
38648,L253977,u1183,m78,A MAN,Turn 'em up.
38649,L253934,u1184,m78,BARON,"If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --"
38650,L253933,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,You might find a bullet through that head...
38651,L253932,u1184,m78,BARON,I have an idea working in my head...
38652,L253931,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,How?
38653,L253930,u1184,m78,BARON,I'll pay you back.
38654,L253929,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,What about the money?
38655,L253928,u1184,m78,BARON,I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
38656,L253927,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,You can't.
38657,L253926,u1184,m78,BARON,I've quit.
38658,L253447,u1184,m78,BARON,With the pearls --
38659,L253446,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,With the pearls?
38660,L253445,u1184,m78,BARON,Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
38661,L253444,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,No --
38662,L253443,u1184,m78,BARON,I don't like your tone.
38663,L253442,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
38664,L253441,u1184,m78,BARON,"Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --"
38665,L253440,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,Why?
38666,L253439,u1184,m78,BARON,No -- no -- no -- no...
38667,L253438,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
38668,L253437,u1184,m78,BARON,How?
38669,L253436,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,I could take care of her.
38670,L253435,u1184,m78,BARON,The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
38671,L253434,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,Why?
38672,L253433,u1184,m78,BARON,No --
38673,L253432,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,Have you got that skeleton key?
38674,L253431,u1184,m78,BARON,No.
38675,L253430,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,Need any help?
38676,L253429,u1184,m78,BARON,I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
38677,L253428,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
38678,L253427,u1184,m78,BARON,"I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance."
38679,L253426,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,"Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared."
38680,L253425,u1184,m78,BARON,The pearls are in her room.
38681,L253424,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,And what are you going to do?
38682,L253423,u1184,m78,BARON,Yes.
38683,L253422,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
38684,L253421,u1184,m78,BARON,Well?
38685,L253420,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
38686,L253218,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,"Yes, sir."
38687,L253217,u1184,m78,BARON,Not now.
38688,L253216,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,I want to speak --
38689,L253215,u1184,m78,BARON,I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
38690,L253214,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,Time's getting short.
38691,L253213,u1184,m78,BARON,No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
38692,L253212,u1185,m78,CHAUFFEUR,Have you a minute now?
38693,L254058,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"And Baron, thanks so much for everything."
38694,L254057,u1184,m78,BARON,"Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen."
38695,L254056,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Yes -- oh!
38696,L254055,u1184,m78,BARON,Oh!
38697,L254054,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,For tonight.
38698,L254053,u1184,m78,BARON,You live here?
38699,L254052,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
38700,L254051,u1184,m78,BARON,"Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night."
38701,L253965,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Yes --
38702,L253964,u1184,m78,BARON,Going?
38703,L253838,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Anything for you.
38704,L253837,u1184,m78,BARON,"I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein."
38705,L253836,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
38706,L253835,u1184,m78,BARON,I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
38707,L253834,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
38708,L253833,u1184,m78,BARON,I feel sorry for him.
38709,L253832,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Why?
38710,L253831,u1184,m78,BARON,Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
38711,L253830,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Yes -- I'd love to.
38712,L253829,u1184,m78,BARON,Would you like to make a man happy?
38713,L253828,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,I'll do anything for you.
38714,L253827,u1184,m78,BARON,Will you do me a big favor?
38715,L253826,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,That was lovely.
38716,L253816,u1184,m78,BARON,Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
38717,L253815,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You were very different yesterday.
38718,L253814,u1184,m78,BARON,Money.
38719,L253813,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Chasing what?
38720,L253812,u1184,m78,BARON,Chasing around.
38721,L253805,u1184,m78,BARON,Sorry.
38722,L253804,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,I'd given you up.
38723,L253271,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,All right. We'll dance.
38724,L253270,u1184,m78,BARON,We'll dance.
38725,L253269,u1184,m78,BARON,Really?
38726,L253268,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Of course.
38727,L253267,u1184,m78,BARON,Yes? -- Tomorrow?
38728,L253266,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You're very funny --
38729,L253265,u1184,m78,BARON,Yellow Room where they dance --
38730,L253264,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Where downstairs?
38731,L253263,u1184,m78,BARON,Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
38732,L253262,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
38733,L253261,u1184,m78,BARON,Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
38734,L253260,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Free --
38735,L253259,u1184,m78,BARON,What?
38736,L253258,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Aren't you?
38737,L253257,u1184,m78,BARON,Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
38738,L253256,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
38739,L253255,u1184,m78,BARON,Too bad.
38740,L253254,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Very little.
38741,L253253,u1184,m78,BARON,Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
38742,L253252,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Money -- Ever heard of it?
38743,L253251,u1184,m78,BARON,Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
38744,L253250,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,No -- why? -- should I?
38745,L253249,u1184,m78,BARON,Reducing?
38746,L253248,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it."
38747,L253247,u1184,m78,BARON,"Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --"
38748,L253246,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Dictation.  You know...
38749,L253245,u1184,m78,BARON,Oh!
38750,L253244,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Oh -- work!!
38751,L253243,u1184,m78,BARON,You?
38752,L253242,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,That.
38753,L253241,u1184,m78,BARON,"Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?"
38754,L253240,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Have you seen it?
38755,L253239,u1184,m78,BARON,Whoever is keeping you waiting.
38756,L253238,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Who?
38757,L253237,u1184,m78,BARON,He must be very nice.
38758,L253236,u1184,m78,BARON,"Yes, I am rather."
38759,L253235,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You're a fool!
38760,L253234,u1184,m78,BARON,Never?
38761,L253233,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Not with strangers.
38762,L253232,u1184,m78,BARON,Like dancing?
38763,L253953,u1184,m78,BARON,Bless you --
38764,L253952,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Till then.
38765,L253951,u1184,m78,BARON,Yes -- I will be on the train.
38766,L253950,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,On the train?
38767,L253949,u1184,m78,BARON,Don't.
38768,L253948,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I'm worried about you.
38769,L253947,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,They've brought me such good luck -- you --
38770,L253946,u1184,m78,BARON,Why?
38771,L253945,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you think --
38772,L253944,u1184,m78,BARON,"No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now..."
38773,L253943,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,No?
38774,L253942,u1184,m78,BARON,I can't.
38775,L253941,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
38776,L253940,u1184,m78,BARON,Bless you...
38777,L253690,u1184,m78,BARON,Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
38778,L253689,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
38779,L253688,u1184,m78,BARON,I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
38780,L253687,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
38781,L253685,u1184,m78,BARON,Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
38782,L253684,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
38783,L253683,u1184,m78,BARON,Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
38784,L253682,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
38785,L253681,u1184,m78,BARON,I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
38786,L253680,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Why later?
38787,L253679,u1184,m78,BARON,Oh -- yes but -- later.
38788,L253678,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
38789,L253677,u1184,m78,BARON,For Vienna?
38790,L253676,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Very early in the morning.
38791,L253675,u1184,m78,BARON,When are you leaving Berlin?
38792,L253674,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Suzette will be back here any minute.
38793,L253673,u1184,m78,BARON,I --
38794,L253672,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Shall I see you again?
38795,L253671,u1184,m78,BARON,I'll go -- good-bye.
38796,L253670,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Suzette will be back here in a minute.
38797,L253669,u1184,m78,BARON,I want to be good to you -- madly good.
38798,L253668,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night."
38799,L253667,u1184,m78,BARON,You do believe that I really love you?
38800,L253666,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Yes.
38801,L253665,u1184,m78,BARON,Grusinskaya --
38802,L253648,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Yes -- yes -- yes.
38803,L253647,u1184,m78,BARON,Do you understand?
38804,L253646,u1184,m78,BARON,I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
38805,L253645,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,And now?
38806,L253644,u1184,m78,BARON,"I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now."
38807,L253643,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---"
38808,L253642,u1184,m78,BARON,"Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --"
38809,L253641,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,So --
38810,L253640,u1184,m78,BARON,I know.
38811,L253639,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I'll not denounce you.
38812,L253638,u1184,m78,BARON,I don't want them now.
38813,L253637,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
38814,L253635,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh --
38815,L253634,u1184,m78,BARON,There.
38816,L253632,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,What is the matter?
38817,L253631,u1184,m78,BARON,Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
38818,L253630,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,That's a silly joke.
38819,L253629,u1184,m78,BARON,I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
38820,L253628,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
38821,L253627,u1184,m78,BARON,"I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail"
38822,L253626,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,And what do you do -- now?
38823,L253625,u1184,m78,BARON,"And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all."
38824,L253624,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,And?
38825,L253623,u1184,m78,BARON,"When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---"
38826,L253622,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,No?
38827,L253621,u1184,m78,BARON,"Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all."
38828,L253620,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Really?
38829,L253619,u1184,m78,BARON,"I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows."
38830,L253618,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
38831,L253617,u1184,m78,BARON,I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
38832,L253616,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name."
38833,L253539,u1184,m78,BARON,"That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it."
38834,L253538,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I want to be alone.
38835,L253537,u1184,m78,BARON,The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
38836,L253536,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,What?
38837,L253535,u1184,m78,BARON,I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
38838,L253533,u1184,m78,BARON,Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
38839,L253532,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,No.
38840,L253531,u1184,m78,BARON,You are beautiful!
38841,L253530,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,What can you see?
38842,L253529,u1184,m78,BARON,Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
38843,L253528,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you smile?
38844,L253527,u1184,m78,BARON,I should like to smoke.
38845,L253526,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?"
38846,L253525,u1184,m78,BARON,"I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing."
38847,L253524,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
38848,L253520,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Just for a minute then.
38849,L253519,u1184,m78,BARON,"No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me."
38850,L253518,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I want to be alone --
38851,L253517,u1184,m78,BARON,That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
38852,L253516,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I want to be alone.
38853,L253515,u1184,m78,BARON,I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
38854,L253514,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
38855,L253513,u1184,m78,BARON,Yes -- I do understand.
38856,L253512,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
38857,L253511,u1184,m78,BARON,I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
38858,L253510,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
38859,L253509,u1184,m78,BARON,"A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you."
38860,L253508,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Go away. Who are you --?
38861,L253507,u1184,m78,BARON,I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
38862,L253506,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
38863,L253505,u1184,m78,BARON,And...?
38864,L253504,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --"
38865,L253503,u1184,m78,BARON,Am I quite strange to you?
38866,L253502,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Strange man...
38867,L253501,u1184,m78,BARON,You mustn't talk Russian to me.
38868,L253500,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature."
38869,L253499,u1184,m78,BARON,So alone.
38870,L253498,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Yes -- tired...
38871,L253497,u1184,m78,BARON,How tired you are!
38872,L253496,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,And -- and --
38873,L253495,u1184,m78,BARON,No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
38874,L253494,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,And then --?
38875,L253493,u1184,m78,BARON,I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
38876,L253492,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you look at me like that?
38877,L253491,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Certainly.
38878,L253490,u1184,m78,BARON,I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
38879,L253489,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
38880,L253488,u1184,m78,BARON,I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
38881,L253487,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
38882,L253486,u1184,m78,BARON,Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
38883,L253485,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
38884,L253484,u1184,m78,BARON,Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
38885,L253483,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Because you love me -- you love me?
38886,L253482,u1184,m78,BARON,But surely you must know -- because I love you.
38887,L253481,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you hide in my room?
38888,L253480,u1184,m78,BARON,Nothing -- only to be here.
38889,L253479,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,What do you want here?
38890,L253478,u1184,m78,BARON,"Please do not be frightened, Madam."
38891,L254048,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay."
38892,L254047,u1184,m78,BARON,"You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein."
38893,L254043,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron."
38894,L254042,u1184,m78,BARON,"Goodnight, Kringelein."
38895,L254041,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron."
38896,L254040,u1184,m78,BARON,"Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein."
38897,L253992,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"All of that at once, Baron?"
38898,L253991,u1184,m78,BARON,I take five hundred.
38899,L253990,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron."
38900,L253989,u1184,m78,BARON,"Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance."
38901,L253988,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again..."
38902,L253987,u1184,m78,BARON,I've no luck.
38903,L253986,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,You've lost everything?
38904,L253985,u1184,m78,BARON,That was my last.
38905,L253974,u1184,m78,BARON,All right then.
38906,L253973,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,All right then.
38907,L253972,u1184,m78,BARON,No -- not at all.
38908,L253971,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Is that too much, Baron?"
38909,L253967,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Ready, Baron."
38910,L253966,u1184,m78,BARON,"Ready, Kringelein?"
38911,L253963,u1184,m78,BARON,Good!
38912,L253962,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,We could come to my room.
38913,L253961,u1184,m78,BARON,If we could scare up some men to play.
38914,L253960,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
38915,L253959,u1184,m78,BARON,If I could get into a game I might win some.
38916,L253958,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?"
38917,L253957,u1184,m78,BARON,What?
38918,L253956,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
38919,L253955,u1184,m78,BARON,"Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately."
38920,L253954,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits."
38921,L253924,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --"
38922,L253923,u1184,m78,BARON,"I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!"
38923,L253922,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?"
38924,L253921,u1184,m78,BARON,"No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --"
38925,L253920,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,The Baron is tired?
38926,L253807,u1184,m78,BARON,No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
38927,L253806,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?"
38928,L253803,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"A little strange, Baron."
38929,L253802,u1184,m78,BARON,"Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?"
38930,L253801,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?"
38931,L253800,u1184,m78,BARON,Hello -- sorry I'm late.
38932,L253720,u1184,m78,BARON,Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
38933,L253719,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?"
38934,L253718,u1184,m78,BARON,I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
38935,L253715,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
38936,L253714,u1184,m78,BARON,"Yes, quite."
38937,L253713,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least..."
38938,L253340,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
38939,L253339,u1184,m78,BARON,Then you know him?
38940,L253338,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --"
38941,L253337,u1184,m78,BARON,"What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?"
38942,L253203,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
38943,L253202,u1184,m78,BARON,And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
38944,L253201,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh, a Baron!"
38945,L253200,u1184,m78,BARON,I'm Baron von Gaigern.
38946,L253199,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
38947,L253198,u1184,m78,BARON,"Not at all, sir."
38948,L253197,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Thank you, sir."
38949,L253345,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is."
38950,L253344,u1184,m78,BARON,"Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov."
38951,L253172,u1184,m78,BARON,"Yes, I was in the war."
38952,L253171,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,The war dropped him here and forgot him.
38953,L253170,u1184,m78,BARON,Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
38954,L253169,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
38955,L253168,u1184,m78,BARON,The war.
38956,L253145,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her."
38957,L253144,u1184,m78,BARON,"My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you."
38958,L253143,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby."
38959,L253142,u1184,m78,BARON,It's always so quiet here.
38960,L253138,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,Yes -- but the audience.
38961,L253137,u1184,m78,BARON,I thought she was splendid!
38962,L253136,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,Well -- last night was not so good.
38963,L253135,u1184,m78,BARON,Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
38964,L253134,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?"
38965,L253133,u1184,m78,BARON,How's the beautiful lady?
38966,L253132,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"Oh -- good evening, Baron."
38967,L253131,u1184,m78,BARON,"Good evening, Mr. Pimenov."
38968,L253130,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
38969,L254086,u1184,m78,BARON,Don't do that.
38970,L254085,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Hello! Hello! --
38971,L254083,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
38972,L254082,u1184,m78,BARON,Be quiet.
38973,L254081,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief."
38974,L254080,u1184,m78,BARON,"Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight."
38975,L254079,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"So that's how we stand, Baron."
38976,L254078,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
38977,L254077,u1184,m78,BARON,I must have made a mistake.
38978,L254076,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
38979,L253863,u1184,m78,BARON,As you will.
38980,L253862,u1195,m78,PREYSING,We shall see who remains here the longer.
38981,L253861,u1184,m78,BARON,I think it would be much better if you went away.
38982,L253860,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I did not ask your advice.
38983,L253859,u1184,m78,BARON,"Oh, let the poor devil alone."
38984,L253845,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Insolent -- Berlin manners.
38985,L253844,u1184,m78,BARON,"Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me."
38986,L254141,u1186,m78,CLERK,Most imposters are --
38987,L254140,u1198,m78,SENF,"I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow."
38988,L254139,u1186,m78,CLERK,It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
38989,L254138,u1198,m78,SENF,Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
38990,L254137,u1186,m78,CLERK,I don't know.
38991,L254136,u1198,m78,SENF,Good heavens. What for?
38992,L254135,u1186,m78,CLERK,The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
38993,L254134,u1198,m78,SENF,What? -- Who? -- Whom?
38994,L254133,u1186,m78,CLERK,News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
38995,L254132,u1198,m78,SENF,"No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?"
38996,L254131,u1186,m78,CLERK,And the child isn't coming?
38997,L254130,u1198,m78,SENF,Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
38998,L254129,u1186,m78,CLERK,The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
38999,L253711,u1198,m78,SENF,"Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron."
39000,L253710,u1186,m78,CLERK,Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
39001,L253222,u1198,m78,SENF,Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
39002,L253221,u1186,m78,CLERK,The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
39003,L253161,u1198,m78,SENF,"If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc."
39004,L253160,u1186,m78,CLERK,No -- letters to two-eighty.
39005,L253159,u1198,m78,SENF,For me?
39006,L253128,u1198,m78,SENF,Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
39007,L253127,u1186,m78,CLERK,No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
39008,L253126,u1198,m78,SENF,For me?
39009,L253118,u1198,m78,SENF,Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
39010,L253117,u1186,m78,CLERK,No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
39011,L253116,u1198,m78,SENF,Is that for me?
39012,L253706,u1198,m78,SENF,"No, doctor."
39013,L253705,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,Any letters?
39014,L253167,u1198,m78,SENF,"Nobody, Doctor."
39015,L253166,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,Anyone asked for me?
39016,L253165,u1198,m78,SENF,"No, Doctor."
39017,L253164,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,Telegrams?
39018,L253163,u1198,m78,SENF,"No, Doctor."
39019,L253162,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,Any letters?
39020,L254045,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,No.
39021,L254044,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"You've nothing to fear, Kringelein"
39022,L254036,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
39023,L254035,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,Stay where you are.
39024,L254034,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh, I've got to find it."
39025,L254032,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?"
39026,L254031,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
39027,L254030,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
39028,L254024,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
39029,L254023,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid."
39030,L254022,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain."
39031,L253984,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen."
39032,L253983,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
39033,L253825,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
39034,L253824,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Everything?
39035,L253823,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
39036,L253822,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
39037,L253821,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man."
39038,L253820,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important."
39039,L253819,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing..."
39040,L253818,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"What, Doctor?"
39041,L253817,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?"
39042,L253785,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold."
39043,L253784,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?"
39044,L253722,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it..."
39045,L253721,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"No pain, Mr. Kringelein?"
39046,L253717,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron."
39047,L253716,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein."
39048,L253546,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,But Doctor --
39049,L253545,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night."
39050,L253544,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --"
39051,L253543,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,The Grand Hotel.
39052,L253542,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel."
39053,L253343,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,"I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein."
39054,L253342,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?"
39055,L253205,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --"
39056,L253204,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
39057,L253191,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,You are ill.
39058,L253190,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
39059,L253189,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,You're tired. I can see that.
39060,L253188,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- but -- I --
39061,L253187,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,Send his bags up to my room.
39062,L253186,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Oh!
39063,L253185,u1187,m78,DOCTOR,This gentleman can have my room.
39064,L253184,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang..."
39065,L254213,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris."
39066,L254212,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
39067,L254209,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
39068,L254208,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Am I!
39069,L254175,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man."
39070,L254174,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Do you like me better?
39071,L254173,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"Oh yes, of course."
39072,L254172,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
39073,L254171,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days."
39074,L254170,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until..."
39075,L254169,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Later?
39076,L254168,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more."
39077,L254167,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
39078,L254166,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
39079,L254165,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,What?
39080,L254164,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
39081,L254163,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You don't understand that do you?
39082,L254162,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Yes, of course, -- money!"
39083,L254161,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Money!
39084,L254160,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Then why did you have anything to do with him?
39085,L254159,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,I didn't like Preysing right off.
39086,L254158,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
39087,L254157,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.

39119,L253790,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
39120,L253789,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?"

39128,L253328,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes."
39129,L253327,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink."
39130,L253326,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
39131,L253325,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?"
39132,L253275,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me."
39133,L253274,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing."
39134,L253273,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
39135,L254072,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'."
39136,L254071,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out."
39137,L254070,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me."

39144,L254063,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You think so?
39145,L254062,u1195,m78,PREYSING,You're sweet.
39146,L254061,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,I had to arrange about the trip.
39147,L254060,u1195,m78,PREYSING,You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.

39157,L253909,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?"
39158,L253908,u1195,m78,PREYSING,What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
39159,L253907,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,I understand perfectly.
39160,L253906,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --"

39166,L253900,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
39167,L253899,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Nothing.
39168,L253898,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
39169,L253897,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?"
39170,L253858,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein."

39188,L253407,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,...weight into the balance...
39189,L253406,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Should throw a great weight into the balance...

39194,L253401,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,You're a little too fast.
39195,L253400,u1195,m78,PREYSING,What?
39196,L253399,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Not too quickly.
39197,L253398,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company..."
39198,L253397,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,No.
39199,L253396,u1195,m78,PREYSING,With the same friend?

39220,L253375,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,"I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies."
39221,L253374,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Moreover...
39222,L253373,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,Moreover...

39232,L253230,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Then you will please wait outside.
39233,L253229,u1188,m78,FLAEMMCHEN,I'm the stenographer.

39235,L253587,u1200,m78,WAITZ,"Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know."
39236,L253586,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,What we want to know about is Manchester.
39237,L253571,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?"
39238,L253570,u1200,m78,WAITZ,Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
39239,L253565,u1200,m78,WAITZ,Shhh -- here he is now.
39240,L253564,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself."
39241,L253563,u1200,m78,WAITZ,Exactly.
39242,L253562,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
39243,L253758,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Next week.
39244,L253757,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details."
39245,L253751,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
39246,L253750,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
39247,L253749,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen."
39248,L253746,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Preysing, you're joking with us."
39249,L253745,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated."
39250,L253744,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,If you actually have news from Manchester then...
39251,L253743,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen."
39252,L253742,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,What?
39253,L253741,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester."
39254,L253740,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've..."
39255,L253738,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Yes --
39256,L253737,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Then, it's all over?"
39257,L253736,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Yes --
39258,L253735,u1195,m78,PREYSING,You've decided against the merger?
39259,L253734,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Sorry, Preysing."
39260,L253727,u1195,m78,PREYSING,What?
39261,L253726,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
39262,L253725,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year."
39263,L253614,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,And I said we didn't.
39264,L253613,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I know you did -- I said you did --
39265,L253601,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Of course you took the initiative.
39266,L253600,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
39267,L253599,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
39268,L253596,u1195,m78,PREYSING,We did not approach you.
39269,L253595,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
39270,L253594,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious..."
39271,L253591,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,All you have to do is phone for it.
39272,L253590,u1195,m78,PREYSING,No water -- What a place!
39273,L253589,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --"
39274,L253588,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself."
39275,L253585,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Mop rags --!
39276,L253584,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --"
39277,L253583,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
39278,L253582,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages."
39279,L253581,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,All right.
39280,L253580,u1195,m78,PREYSING,We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
39281,L253579,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,I mean with the Manchester people?
39282,L253578,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"We have a good many connections in England, naturally."
39283,L253577,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
39284,L253574,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?"
39285,L253573,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
39286,L253572,u1195,m78,PREYSING,What?
39287,L253754,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,What a session this has been.
39288,L253753,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here."
39289,L253733,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now."
39290,L253732,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
39291,L253724,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days."
39292,L253723,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
39293,L253612,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,We did not approach you.
39294,L253611,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,As you remember it -- when you approached us...
39295,L253610,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
39296,L253609,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger..."
39297,L253606,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?"
39298,L253605,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,How clear is Manchester?
39299,L253748,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
39300,L253747,u1197,m78,SCHWEIMANN,You're a deep one.
39301,L253731,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Ah, come on -- we're going home."
39302,L253730,u1197,m78,SCHWEIMANN,You see -- what we are interested in --
39303,L253729,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,Why waste time -- it's getting late.
39304,L253728,u1197,m78,SCHWEIMANN,Shall I tell them again?
39305,L253559,u1197,m78,SCHWEIMANN,He likes to play the great man.
39306,L253558,u1189,m78,GERSTENKORN,"Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting."
39307,L254178,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
39308,L254177,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs."
39309,L254124,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Goodnight, Suzette."
39310,L254123,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train."
39311,L254122,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette."
39312,L254121,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
39313,L254120,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
39314,L254119,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,Madam should sleep.
39315,L253656,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it."
39316,L253655,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring."
39317,L253654,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Madam will dress now, it is late."
39318,L253653,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Oh, yes, Suzette."
39319,L253652,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,Madam has slept well?
39320,L253651,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Good morning, Madam."
39321,L253650,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Good morning, Suzette."
39322,L253317,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry."
39323,L253316,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Oh, come, Madam -- please come."
39324,L253297,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Send it away -- I shan't need it.
39325,L253296,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam."
39326,L253295,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet."
39327,L253294,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --"
39328,L253293,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
39329,L253292,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
39330,L253290,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
39331,L253289,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,"But, Madam. cannot do that."
39332,L253288,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Let us cancel the engagement.
39333,L253287,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
39334,L253286,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I can't dance tonight --
39335,L253285,u1199,m78,SUZETTE,Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
39336,L253284,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep."
39337,L254199,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
39338,L254198,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
39339,L254197,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --"
39340,L254187,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
39341,L254186,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,"Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going."
39342,L253467,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,"You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end."
39343,L253466,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I wish to be alone.
39344,L253465,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
39345,L253352,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,Such nonsense.
39346,L253351,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Hurry, Suzette."
39347,L253350,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,You haven't time.
39348,L253349,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Take them back, Suzette."
39349,L253348,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,Why not?
39350,L253347,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
39351,L253315,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh -- but it can't be.
39352,L253314,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
39353,L253313,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,The house is not full -- Is it really full?
39354,L253312,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,"Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof."
39355,L253311,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,Oh!
39356,L253310,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,I'm cancelling the engagement.
39357,L253309,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,"What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?"
39358,L254180,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,But when did he go? How do you know?
39359,L254179,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,He will be on the train.
39360,L253698,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you."
39361,L253697,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,Gru -- you are positively radiant.
39362,L253695,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"Good morning, Gru -- your --"
39363,L253694,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"Good morning, Pimenov."
39364,L253307,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,"That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished."
39365,L253306,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,There was -- there was.
39366,L253305,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,Last night?... There was no applause.
39367,L253304,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,What -- what is it? Last night...
39368,L253303,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
39369,L253301,u1190,m78,GRUSINSKAYA,The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
39370,L253300,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,It is time for the performance.
39371,L253211,u1192,m78,MANAGER,Please.
39372,L253210,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Again?
39373,L253209,u1192,m78,MANAGER,Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
39374,L253195,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like."
39375,L253194,u1192,m78,MANAGER,"Certainly, sir."
39376,L253193,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
39377,L253192,u1192,m78,MANAGER,"Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath."
39378,L254115,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four."
39379,L254114,u1195,m78,PREYSING,How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
39380,L254113,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"We must call the police, your excellency."
39381,L254112,u1195,m78,PREYSING,The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
39382,L254111,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Yes, I know them --"
39383,L254110,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?"
39384,L254109,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing."
39385,L254108,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
39386,L254107,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron."
39387,L254106,u1195,m78,PREYSING,No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
39388,L254105,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Yes, the police must be called."
39389,L254104,u1195,m78,PREYSING,-- We must do something...
39390,L254103,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that."
39391,L254102,u1195,m78,PREYSING,He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
39392,L254101,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
39393,L253887,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
39394,L253886,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Me?
39395,L253885,u1195,m78,PREYSING,You're discharged.
39396,L253884,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing."
39397,L253883,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
39398,L253880,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Go away -- go away.
39399,L253879,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man."
39400,L253878,u1195,m78,PREYSING,What is this insolence?
39401,L253877,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?"
39402,L253876,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"You may go, Mr. Kringelein."
39403,L253875,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?"
39404,L253874,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk."
39405,L253856,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books."
39406,L253855,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,I could not think of not accepting.
39407,L253854,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
39408,L253848,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor."
39409,L253847,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I don't know you.
39410,L253846,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?"
39411,L253183,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
39412,L253182,u1196,m78,ROHNA,The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
39413,L253179,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,"No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute."
39414,L253178,u1196,m78,ROHNA,"Just one moment, sir."
39415,L253177,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
39416,L253176,u1196,m78,ROHNA,"It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir."
39417,L253175,u1191,m78,KRINGELEIN,I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
39418,L253174,u1196,m78,ROHNA,"If you will wait one moment, sir."
39419,L254196,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,Madam Grusinskaya's car.
39420,L254195,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there."
39421,L254194,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,Four minutes past. Please come.
39422,L254189,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,"The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?"
39423,L254188,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there."
39424,L253324,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
39425,L253323,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,"If the house is empty again, I don't know --"
39426,L253322,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,"Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz."
39427,L253321,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,How is the house?
39428,L253319,u1193,m78,MEIERHEIM,You are late. Hurry.
39429,L253318,u1194,m78,PIMENOV,We will wait.
39430,L253781,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight."
39431,L253780,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
39432,L253779,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,Pretty as a picture.
39433,L253778,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?"
39434,L253777,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
39435,L253776,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law."
39436,L253775,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,What do you want with her?
39437,L253774,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
39438,L253773,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
39439,L253772,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
39440,L253771,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,What you need is some relaxation.
39441,L253770,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
39442,L253769,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
39443,L253768,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on..."
39444,L253767,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"'Deal with Manchester definitely off! ""Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you."
39445,L253766,u1195,m78,PREYSING,That.
39446,L253765,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,What's bluff?
39447,L253764,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
39448,L253763,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,What's the matter with you?
39449,L253760,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
39450,L253759,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Next week.
39451,L253608,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,Well -- gentlemen.
39452,L253607,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
39453,L253604,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --"
39454,L253603,u1195,m78,PREYSING,"Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?"
39455,L253602,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway."
39456,L253360,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Good night.
39457,L253359,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight."
39458,L253358,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
39459,L253357,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,"Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through."
39460,L253356,u1195,m78,PREYSING,Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
39461,L253355,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
39462,L253354,u1195,m78,PREYSING,No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
39463,L253156,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
39464,L253155,u1195,m78,PREYSING,I know -- I know.
39465,L253154,u1201,m78,ZINNOWITZ,Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
39466,L253153,u1195,m78,PREYSING,No. No word.

39473,L255510,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am."
39474,L255509,u1202,m79,BOBO,Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
39475,L255508,u1210,m79,LILLY,"You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller."
39476,L255507,u1202,m79,BOBO,"You know it, Lilly."
39477,L255506,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big."
39478,L255505,u1202,m79,BOBO,You're a thousand percent right!
39479,L255504,u1210,m79,LILLY,"A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?"
39480,L255503,u1202,m79,BOBO,"That's right. Take a little, leave a little."
39481,L255502,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice."
39482,L255501,u1202,m79,BOBO,"Not skimming a thing, Lilly?"
39483,L255499,u1202,m79,BOBO,"On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?"
39484,L255498,u1210,m79,LILLY,He's a good kid. A salesman.
39485,L255497,u1202,m79,BOBO,"See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly."
39486,L255496,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez."
39487,L255495,u1202,m79,BOBO,You want a drink?
39488,L255494,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Oh, thanks, Bobo."
39489,L255493,u1202,m79,BOBO,Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.

39494,L255485,u1202,m79,BOBO,And if you do it wrong?
39495,L255484,u1210,m79,LILLY,"You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies."

39497,L255481,u1210,m79,LILLY,"You mean, the insurance frammis?"

39505,L255471,u1202,m79,BOBO,"I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this."

39516,L255459,u1202,m79,BOBO,"Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!"
39517,L255458,u1210,m79,LILLY,I want to keep my teeth.
39518,L255457,u1202,m79,BOBO,"One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?"
39519,L255456,u1210,m79,LILLY,"I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--"
39520,L255455,u1202,m79,BOBO,"You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?"

39544,L255354,u1203,m79,CLERK,Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
39545,L255749,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?"

39547,L255746,u1204,m79,COLE,It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
39548,L255745,u1213,m79,MYRA,"It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation."
39549,L255744,u1204,m79,COLE,Can't move.
39550,L255743,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?"
39551,L255730,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Henry, no!"
39552,L255729,u1204,m79,COLE,You ruined me! You destroyed me!
39553,L255699,u1213,m79,MYRA,"We're not really interested, Henry."
39554,L255698,u1204,m79,COLE,Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
39555,L255697,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring."
39556,L255696,u1204,m79,COLE,Want a look?
39557,L255680,u1204,m79,COLE,"Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken."
39558,L255679,u1213,m79,MYRA,So here we are!
39559,L255678,u1204,m79,COLE,"Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already..."
39560,L255676,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could..."
39561,L255675,u1204,m79,COLE,Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
39562,L255674,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --"

39564,L255670,u1204,m79,COLE,"Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money."
39565,L255669,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?"
39566,L255668,u1204,m79,COLE,"Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely."
39567,L255667,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!"
39568,L255666,u1204,m79,COLE,"Mary Beth, what we have here, uh..."
39569,L255716,u1204,m79,COLE,You brought a case? Good.
39570,L255715,u1206,m79,HEBBING,"I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried."
39571,L255714,u1204,m79,COLE,Here you are! Two rich people!
39572,L255695,u1204,m79,COLE,These machines -- They're in here.
39573,L255694,u1206,m79,HEBBING,Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
39574,L255693,u1204,m79,COLE,"We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately."
39575,L255692,u1206,m79,HEBBING,Not much time.
39576,L255691,u1204,m79,COLE,"Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in."
39577,L255690,u1206,m79,HEBBING,"Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that."
39578,L255689,u1204,m79,COLE,"You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?"
39579,L255688,u1206,m79,HEBBING,"One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?"
39580,L255687,u1204,m79,COLE,"The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?"
39581,L255685,u1206,m79,HEBBING,"I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes."
39582,L255684,u1204,m79,COLE,Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
39583,L255683,u1206,m79,HEBBING,I certainly hope not.
39584,L255682,u1204,m79,COLE,And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
39585,L255681,u1206,m79,HEBBING,"Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?"
39586,L255353,u1210,m79,LILLY,"My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed."

39589,L255350,u1205,m79,DOCTOR,His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
39590,L255349,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Well, make it stop!"
39591,L255348,u1205,m79,DOCTOR,"Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside."
39592,L255347,u1210,m79,LILLY,What? He's going to be all right!
39593,L255346,u1205,m79,DOCTOR,"The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do."
39594,L255293,u1210,m79,LILLY,Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
39595,L255292,u1207,m79,IRV,"Take two, three days. Call when you get there."
39596,L255291,u1210,m79,LILLY,I know.
39597,L255290,u1207,m79,IRV,"Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo."
39598,L255289,u1210,m79,LILLY,Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
39599,L255288,u1207,m79,IRV,Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
39600,L255258,u1213,m79,MYRA,You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
39601,L255257,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"Well, I'd have to see it, of course."
39602,L255256,u1213,m79,MYRA,I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
39603,L255255,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in..."
39604,L255254,u1213,m79,MYRA,It's not your fault.
39605,L255253,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry."
39606,L255252,u1208,m79,JEWELER,I'll get you a check.
39607,L255251,u1213,m79,MYRA,All right.
39608,L255250,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars."
39609,L255249,u1213,m79,MYRA,It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
39610,L255248,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?"
39611,L255247,u1213,m79,MYRA,But they must be! They cut glass!
39612,L255246,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry."
39613,L255245,u1213,m79,MYRA,What is?
39614,L255244,u1208,m79,JEWELER,I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
39615,L255243,u1213,m79,MYRA,But what's wrong?
39616,L255242,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"You are a valued customer, as you know."
39617,L255241,u1213,m79,MYRA,Why? What's wrong?
39618,L255240,u1208,m79,JEWELER,"Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry."
39619,L255842,u1215,m79,ROY,Fair enough.
39620,L255841,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?"
39621,L255840,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was."
39622,L255839,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too."
39623,L255838,u1215,m79,ROY,Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
39624,L255837,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about."
39625,L255836,u1215,m79,ROY,"Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities..."
39626,L255835,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"Perk, remember?"
39627,L255834,u1215,m79,ROY,"The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --"
39628,L255833,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"Oh, come on, Roy."
39629,L255832,u1215,m79,ROY,I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
39630,L255831,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy."
39631,L255830,u1215,m79,ROY,"Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry."
39632,L255829,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --"
39633,L255581,u1215,m79,ROY,Perk.
39634,L255580,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid."
39635,L255579,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, sure. Fine."
39636,L255578,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?"
39637,L255577,u1215,m79,ROY,Well...
39638,L255576,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer."
39639,L255575,u1215,m79,ROY,But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
39640,L255574,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?"
39641,L255573,u1215,m79,ROY,"I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --"
39642,L255572,u1209,m79,KAGGS,No?
39643,L255571,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, uh... No."
39644,L255570,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?"
39645,L255569,u1215,m79,ROY,What? Me?
39646,L255568,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent."
39647,L255567,u1215,m79,ROY,Sounds like a good Idea.
39648,L255566,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?"
39649,L255565,u1215,m79,ROY,Just myself.
39650,L255564,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?"
39651,L255563,u1215,m79,ROY,So I heard.
39652,L255562,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally."
39653,L255560,u1215,m79,ROY,Lead on.
39654,L255559,u1209,m79,KAGGS,You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
39655,L255558,u1215,m79,ROY,"That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman."
39656,L255557,u1209,m79,KAGGS,What's up?
39657,L255556,u1209,m79,KAGGS,"I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon."
39658,L255555,u1215,m79,ROY,Roy Dillon.
39659,L255554,u1209,m79,KAGGS,Kaggs. Home office.
39660,L255541,u1209,m79,KAGGS,Hello.
39661,L255540,u1215,m79,ROY,Whadaya say?
39662,L256049,u1215,m79,ROY,NO!
39663,L256048,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --"
39664,L256047,u1215,m79,ROY,"Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?"
39665,L256045,u1210,m79,LILLY,"I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?"
39666,L256044,u1215,m79,ROY,There's nothing more to talk about.
39667,L256040,u1215,m79,ROY,What?
39668,L256039,u1210,m79,LILLY,Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
39669,L256038,u1215,m79,ROY,"Just trying to help, Lilly."
39670,L256037,u1210,m79,LILLY,") That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power."
39671,L256036,u1215,m79,ROY,"That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes..."
39672,L256035,u1210,m79,LILLY,A future. The only future I've got.
39673,L256034,u1215,m79,ROY,"If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?"
39674,L256032,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly."
39675,L256031,u1210,m79,LILLY,"And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game."
39676,L256030,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out."
39677,L256029,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different."
39678,L256028,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, uh..."
39679,L256027,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him."
39680,L256026,u1215,m79,ROY,I don't see why not.
39681,L256025,u1210,m79,LILLY,"If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?"
39682,L256024,u1215,m79,ROY,I don't?
39683,L256023,u1210,m79,LILLY,"That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know."
39684,L256022,u1215,m79,ROY,That's right.
39685,L256021,u1210,m79,LILLY,You're getting off the grift?
39686,L256020,u1215,m79,ROY,No.
39687,L256019,u1210,m79,LILLY,I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
39688,L256018,u1215,m79,ROY,"For God's sake, Lilly!"
39689,L256017,u1210,m79,LILLY,"And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy."
39690,L256016,u1215,m79,ROY,What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
39691,L256015,u1210,m79,LILLY,"No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up."
39692,L256014,u1215,m79,ROY,Never.
39693,L256013,u1210,m79,LILLY,I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
39694,L256012,u1215,m79,ROY,Uh-huh.
39695,L256011,u1210,m79,LILLY,"A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was."
39696,L256010,u1215,m79,ROY,Not very good!
39697,L256009,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid."
39698,L256008,u1215,m79,ROY,Oh? I didn't know anything was.
39699,L256007,u1210,m79,LILLY,"I know what's bugging you, of course."
39700,L256006,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, you'll live, Lilly."
39701,L256005,u1210,m79,LILLY,"You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live."
39702,L256002,u1210,m79,LILLY,I'll get it.
39703,L256001,u1215,m79,ROY,"Yeah, sure, that sounds nice."
39704,L256000,u1210,m79,LILLY,"No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?"
39705,L255999,u1215,m79,ROY,I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
39706,L255998,u1210,m79,LILLY,You want a drink?
39707,L255997,u1215,m79,ROY,No.
39708,L255996,u1210,m79,LILLY,"And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this."
39709,L255995,u1215,m79,ROY,"I know you do, so that's why --"
39710,L255994,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive."
39711,L255993,u1215,m79,ROY,"I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --"
39712,L255992,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --"
39713,L255991,u1215,m79,ROY,"I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --"
39714,L255990,u1210,m79,LILLY,What?
39715,L255989,u1215,m79,ROY,"Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself."
39716,L255988,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there."
39717,L255987,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you."
39718,L255986,u1210,m79,LILLY,A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
39719,L255985,u1215,m79,ROY,"You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job."
39720,L255984,u1210,m79,LILLY,At what?
39721,L255983,u1215,m79,ROY,"Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over."
39722,L255982,u1210,m79,LILLY,Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
39723,L255981,u1215,m79,ROY,And Myra's stuff?
39724,L255980,u1210,m79,LILLY,Just a few bucks.
39725,L255979,u1215,m79,ROY,You must have some money.
39726,L255978,u1210,m79,LILLY,"I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead."
39727,L255977,u1215,m79,ROY,Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
39728,L255976,u1210,m79,LILLY,"I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --"
39729,L255975,u1215,m79,ROY,"You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though."
39730,L255974,u1210,m79,LILLY,"It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --"
39731,L255973,u1215,m79,ROY,This way's perfect.
39732,L255972,u1210,m79,LILLY,"I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?"
39733,L255969,u1215,m79,ROY,"That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?"
39734,L255968,u1210,m79,LILLY,As though you do what I say.
39735,L255967,u1215,m79,ROY,I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
39736,L255966,u1210,m79,LILLY,"No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?"
39737,L255965,u1215,m79,ROY,No.
39738,L255964,u1210,m79,LILLY,She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
39739,L255963,u1215,m79,ROY,"Myra followed you, huh?"
39740,L255961,u1215,m79,ROY,"Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down."
39741,L255960,u1210,m79,LILLY,Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
39742,L255959,u1215,m79,ROY,Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
39743,L255958,u1210,m79,LILLY,Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
39744,L255957,u1215,m79,ROY,"You're dead, Lilly, it worked."
39745,L255956,u1210,m79,LILLY,I've really got to --
39746,L255955,u1215,m79,ROY,"Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it."
39747,L255954,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?"
39748,L255953,u1215,m79,ROY,I just came back from Phoenix.
39749,L255952,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Somewhere else, that's for sure."
39750,L255951,u1215,m79,ROY,Going somewhere?
39751,L255884,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, that's good news."
39752,L255883,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know."
39753,L255794,u1210,m79,LILLY,"You, too, Roy."
39754,L255793,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well... nice to see you again, Lilly."
39755,L255792,u1210,m79,LILLY,After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
39756,L255791,u1215,m79,ROY,"I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?"
39757,L255790,u1210,m79,LILLY,I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
39758,L255787,u1210,m79,LILLY,"No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air."
39759,L255786,u1215,m79,ROY,You ought to put a bandage on that.
39760,L255785,u1210,m79,LILLY,No. That was the point.
39761,L255784,u1215,m79,ROY,Expecting visitors?
39762,L255783,u1210,m79,LILLY,You do?
39763,L255782,u1215,m79,ROY,I pay my debts.
39764,L255781,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Roy, I don't want money from you."
39765,L255780,u1215,m79,ROY,Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
39766,L255779,u1210,m79,LILLY,What's that?
39767,L255778,u1215,m79,ROY,We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
39768,L255777,u1210,m79,LILLY,"If you come out to the track, don't know me."
39769,L255776,u1215,m79,ROY,Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
39770,L255775,u1210,m79,LILLY,Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
39771,L255523,u1215,m79,ROY,That's right.
39772,L255522,u1210,m79,LILLY,I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
39773,L255521,u1210,m79,LILLY,You don't have the stomach for it.
39774,L255520,u1215,m79,ROY,Why?
39775,L255519,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Get off the grift, Roy."
39776,L255518,u1215,m79,ROY,I tripped over a chair.
39777,L255517,u1210,m79,LILLY,"You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?"
39778,L255516,u1215,m79,ROY,You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
39779,L255515,u1210,m79,LILLY,He let me live. He let me be his friend.
39780,L255514,u1215,m79,ROY,Lucky? You call that lucky?
39781,L255447,u1210,m79,LILLY,"I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't."
39782,L255446,u1215,m79,ROY,Bluebell came in?
39783,L255445,u1210,m79,LILLY,"That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out."
39784,L255444,u1210,m79,LILLY,"The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be."
39785,L255443,u1215,m79,ROY,Sure.
39786,L255442,u1210,m79,LILLY,"My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down."
39787,L255441,u1215,m79,ROY,Up to you.
39788,L255439,u1210,m79,LILLY,No. And you have to be.
39789,L255438,u1215,m79,ROY,"Not as tough as you, huh?"
39790,L255436,u1215,m79,ROY,How come?
39791,L255435,u1210,m79,LILLY,"That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --"
39792,L255434,u1215,m79,ROY,You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
39793,L255433,u1210,m79,LILLY,"You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!"
39794,L255432,u1215,m79,ROY,I like those.
39795,L255431,u1210,m79,LILLY,And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
39796,L255430,u1215,m79,ROY,"It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself."
39797,L255429,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?"
39798,L255428,u1215,m79,ROY,What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
39799,L255427,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?"
39800,L255426,u1215,m79,ROY,"I can take care of my own bills, Lilly."
39801,L255425,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them."
39802,L255424,u1215,m79,ROY,What happened to your hand?
39803,L255391,u1210,m79,LILLY,You always did.
39804,L255390,u1215,m79,ROY,I guess I owe you my life.
39805,L255389,u1210,m79,LILLY,Don't mention it.
39806,L255388,u1215,m79,ROY,"Thanks, uh, Lilly."
39807,L255387,u1210,m79,LILLY,"Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track."
39808,L255378,u1215,m79,ROY,Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
39809,L255377,u1210,m79,LILLY,I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
39810,L255376,u1215,m79,ROY,"Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?"
39811,L255363,u1210,m79,LILLY,Only one tooth?
39812,L255362,u1215,m79,ROY,They knocked out my tooth!
39813,L255361,u1210,m79,LILLY,Only one arm?
39814,L255360,u1215,m79,ROY,They twisted my arm.
39815,L255359,u1210,m79,LILLY,So what's your story today?
39816,L255405,u1213,m79,MYRA,"We'll work something out, Joe."
39817,L255404,u1211,m79,MANAGER,This time...
39818,L255403,u1213,m79,MYRA,I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
39819,L255402,u1211,m79,MANAGER,"My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting."
39820,L255401,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?"
39821,L255400,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Joe, you know you'll --"
39822,L255399,u1211,m79,MANAGER,"It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money."
39823,L255398,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --"
39824,L255397,u1211,m79,MANAGER,"I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent."
39825,L255396,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You heard the shower, didn't you?"
39826,L255338,u1215,m79,ROY,In your other hand.
39827,L255337,u1212,m79,MINTZ,Where's the five?
39828,L255336,u1215,m79,ROY,I am in school.
39829,L255335,u1212,m79,MINTZ,You're too young. You should be in school.
39830,L255334,u1215,m79,ROY,I can't. I just left home.
39831,L255333,u1212,m79,MINTZ,Scram. Go home.
39832,L255332,u1215,m79,ROY,Let me see how you did that one.
39833,L255331,u1215,m79,ROY,You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
39834,L255330,u1212,m79,MINTZ,I didn't teach you that.
39835,L255871,u1213,m79,MYRA,"I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --"
39836,L255870,u1215,m79,ROY,You watch that mouth.
39837,L255869,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?"
39838,L255868,u1215,m79,ROY,What's that?
39839,L255867,u1213,m79,MYRA,Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
39840,L255866,u1215,m79,ROY,) What?
39841,L255865,u1213,m79,MYRA,"By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly."
39842,L255864,u1215,m79,ROY,I'm happy the way I am.
39843,L255863,u1213,m79,MYRA,What is it? What's going on?
39844,L255862,u1215,m79,ROY,"No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you."
39845,L255861,u1213,m79,MYRA,Bullshit!
39846,L255860,u1215,m79,ROY,"Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever."
39847,L255859,u1213,m79,MYRA,"For Christ's sake, why not?"
39848,L255858,u1215,m79,ROY,"What I say is, no. We don't do partners."
39849,L255857,u1213,m79,MYRA,What?
39850,L255856,u1215,m79,ROY,That's what I say.
39851,L255855,u1213,m79,MYRA,No! Because I --
39852,L255854,u1215,m79,ROY,Don't I get any say in this?
39853,L255852,u1215,m79,ROY,Maybe I like it where I am.
39854,L255851,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day."
39855,L255850,u1215,m79,ROY,I don't think I need it.
39856,L255849,u1213,m79,MYRA,But the setup's there. It's there now.
39857,L255848,u1215,m79,ROY,"The last I looked, we were just talking things over."
39858,L255847,u1213,m79,MYRA,What?
39859,L255846,u1215,m79,ROY,"Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?"
39860,L255845,u1213,m79,MYRA,"I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --"
39861,L255844,u1215,m79,ROY,"And hello to you, too."
39862,L255824,u1215,m79,ROY,Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
39863,L255823,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds."
39864,L255822,u1215,m79,ROY,"Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out."
39865,L255821,u1213,m79,MYRA,But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
39866,L255820,u1215,m79,ROY,Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
39867,L255819,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy."
39868,L255818,u1215,m79,ROY,"Running your broker scam, you mean."
39869,L255817,u1213,m79,MYRA,"I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us."
39870,L255816,u1215,m79,ROY,You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
39871,L255815,u1213,m79,MYRA,"I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is."
39872,L255814,u1215,m79,ROY,"She didn't see you, in other words."
39873,L255813,u1213,m79,MYRA,I saw her.
39874,L255812,u1215,m79,ROY,) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
39875,L255811,u1213,m79,MYRA,I went out to Delmar.
39876,L255810,u1215,m79,ROY,You were gone for a while.
39877,L255774,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, come here."
39878,L255773,u1213,m79,MYRA,") If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!"
39879,L255772,u1215,m79,ROY,You -- I don't know.
39880,L255769,u1213,m79,MYRA,Open it and find out.
39881,L255768,u1215,m79,ROY,What?  What for?
39882,L255767,u1213,m79,MYRA,Open your door.
39883,L255766,u1215,m79,ROY,Yeah?
39884,L255764,u1215,m79,ROY,Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
39885,L255763,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out."
39886,L255762,u1215,m79,ROY,Things a man isn't supposed to know.
39887,L255761,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over."
39888,L255760,u1215,m79,ROY,I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
39889,L255758,u1215,m79,ROY,Sure.
39890,L255757,u1213,m79,MYRA,Think about it. Okay?
39891,L255756,u1213,m79,MYRA,Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
39892,L255755,u1215,m79,ROY,"I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them."
39893,L255754,u1213,m79,MYRA,"I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole."
39894,L255753,u1215,m79,ROY,"Take a hike, you mean?"
39895,L255752,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just..."
39896,L255751,u1215,m79,ROY,"I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me."
39897,L255740,u1215,m79,ROY,"That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?"
39898,L255739,u1213,m79,MYRA,Atascadero.
39899,L255738,u1215,m79,ROY,Upstate where?
39900,L255737,u1213,m79,MYRA,Upstate.
39901,L255736,u1215,m79,ROY,Where?
39902,L255735,u1213,m79,MYRA,He retired.
39903,L255734,u1215,m79,ROY,What happened to Cole?
39904,L255733,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year."
39905,L255711,u1215,m79,ROY,Yeah? How?
39906,L255710,u1213,m79,MYRA,"No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off."
39907,L255709,u1215,m79,ROY,"And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run."
39908,L255708,u1213,m79,MYRA,"No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole."
39909,L255707,u1215,m79,ROY,I thought these people were broke.
39910,L255706,u1213,m79,MYRA,"He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!"
39911,L255705,u1215,m79,ROY,And when he got serious?
39912,L255704,u1213,m79,MYRA,"He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark."
39913,L255655,u1213,m79,MYRA,"It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game."
39914,L255654,u1215,m79,ROY,Is that right?
39915,L255653,u1213,m79,MYRA,It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
39916,L255652,u1215,m79,ROY,I've heard the name.
39917,L255651,u1213,m79,MYRA,I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
39918,L255650,u1215,m79,ROY,Nobody does that single-o.
39919,L255649,u1213,m79,MYRA,The long end. Big con.
39920,L255648,u1215,m79,ROY,You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
39921,L255647,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square."
39922,L255646,u1215,m79,ROY,"Myra, I'm not following this."
39923,L255645,u1213,m79,MYRA,You're on the grift. Same as me.
39924,L255644,u1215,m79,ROY,I'm a salesman.
39925,L255643,u1213,m79,MYRA,The tap. What you do for a living.
39926,L255642,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Oh, come on, Roy."
39927,L255641,u1215,m79,ROY,Working the what?
39928,L255640,u1213,m79,MYRA,I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
39929,L255639,u1215,m79,ROY,What?
39930,L255638,u1213,m79,MYRA,You already went back to work.
39931,L255637,u1215,m79,ROY,"Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work."
39932,L255636,u1213,m79,MYRA,I'll sign that affidavit.
39933,L255635,u1215,m79,ROY,"You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more."
39934,L255591,u1215,m79,ROY,See you soon.
39935,L255590,u1213,m79,MYRA,No.
39936,L255588,u1215,m79,ROY,You ain't seen nothin.
39937,L255587,u1213,m79,MYRA,Big spender.
39938,L255586,u1215,m79,ROY,We'll rent a car.
39939,L255585,u1213,m79,MYRA,What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
39940,L255584,u1215,m79,ROY,Because it's comfortable.
39941,L255583,u1213,m79,MYRA,I don't see why we have to take the train.
39942,L255423,u1213,m79,MYRA,I'll see you when you get home.
39943,L255422,u1215,m79,ROY,Every day in every way.
39944,L255421,u1213,m79,MYRA,Get well soon.
39945,L255416,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth."
39946,L255415,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, don't be stupid."
39947,L255414,u1213,m79,MYRA,And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
39948,L255413,u1215,m79,ROY,That's just Lilly's way.
39949,L255412,u1213,m79,MYRA,"I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks."
39950,L255411,u1215,m79,ROY,"I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that."
39951,L255410,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you."
39952,L255409,u1215,m79,ROY,Mama!
39953,L255408,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you."
39954,L255407,u1215,m79,ROY,"I just do what the doctor says, babe."
39955,L255406,u1213,m79,MYRA,I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
39956,L255395,u1215,m79,ROY,"You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts."
39957,L255394,u1213,m79,MYRA,I want to know everything about you.
39958,L255393,u1215,m79,ROY,Her job.
39959,L255382,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?"
39960,L255381,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you."
39961,L255380,u1215,m79,ROY,"You called the doctor, huh?"
39962,L255379,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?"
39963,L255305,u1213,m79,MYRA,"No, baby. Come to Mama."
39964,L255304,u1215,m79,ROY,"Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?"
39965,L255302,u1213,m79,MYRA,I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
39966,L255301,u1215,m79,ROY,"What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?"
39967,L255300,u1213,m79,MYRA,No more than this?
39968,L255299,u1215,m79,ROY,All? It ain't bad.
39969,L255298,u1213,m79,MYRA,Roy? It this all we have?
39970,L255297,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, I am, baby, believe me."
39971,L255296,u1213,m79,MYRA,Look at me.
39972,L255295,u1215,m79,ROY,Mm?
39973,L255294,u1213,m79,MYRA,Roy?
39974,L255286,u1215,m79,ROY,Let's find out.
39975,L255285,u1213,m79,MYRA,Are you sure?
39976,L255284,u1215,m79,ROY,"That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all."
39977,L255283,u1215,m79,ROY,Taking you for granite?
39978,L255282,u1213,m79,MYRA,"You aren't taking me for granted, are you?"
39979,L255281,u1215,m79,ROY,"Always, for you, baby."
39980,L255280,u1213,m79,MYRA,"Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?"
39981,L255944,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, yeah. That's that."
39982,L255943,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"That's that, then."
39983,L255942,u1215,m79,ROY,"No, its -- Why did she--?"
39984,L255941,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"No question, huh?"
39985,L255940,u1215,m79,ROY,"Oh, Jesus."
39986,L255938,u1214,m79,PIERSON,Not many.
39987,L255937,u1215,m79,ROY,"Not many laughs in this room, eh?"
39988,L255936,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, let's get the shock over with."
39989,L255935,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock."
39990,L255934,u1215,m79,ROY,Ate the gun. Oh.
39991,L255933,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here."
39992,L255932,u1215,m79,ROY,What?
39993,L255931,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun."
39994,L255930,u1215,m79,ROY,"Yes, I know, I know."
39995,L255929,u1214,m79,PIERSON,One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
39996,L255928,u1215,m79,ROY,Sure. Let's get it over.
39997,L255927,u1214,m79,PIERSON,You up to it now?
39998,L255926,u1215,m79,ROY,Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
39999,L255925,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me."
40000,L255924,u1215,m79,ROY,"My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day."
40001,L255923,u1214,m79,PIERSON,Do you have any particular reason to say that?
40002,L255922,u1215,m79,ROY,"It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide."
40003,L255921,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon."
40004,L255920,u1215,m79,ROY,Gun?
40005,L255919,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even."
40006,L255918,u1215,m79,ROY,"No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out."
40007,L255917,u1214,m79,PIERSON,That's natural.
40008,L255916,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, mostly, I don't believe it."
40009,L255915,u1214,m79,PIERSON,I realize this is a shock.
40010,L255914,u1215,m79,ROY,Thank you.
40011,L255913,u1214,m79,PIERSON,"Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here."
40012,L255912,u1215,m79,ROY,Yes?
40013,L255911,u1214,m79,PIERSON,Roy Dillon?
40014,L255537,u1216,m79,SIMMS,Happy to see you looking so good.
40015,L255536,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush."
40016,L255535,u1216,m79,SIMMS,"We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves."
40017,L255534,u1215,m79,ROY,"That's true, Mr. Simms."
40018,L255533,u1216,m79,SIMMS,"Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon."
40019,L255532,u1215,m79,ROY,"Well, thank you. And thank them."
40020,L255272,u1215,m79,ROY,Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
40021,L255271,u1216,m79,SIMMS,"Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--"
40022,L255270,u1215,m79,ROY,Mr. Simms.
40023,L257693,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
40024,L257692,u1218,m80,CARTER,Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
40025,L257690,u1218,m80,CARTER,"The door was open, so we let ourselves in."
40026,L257689,u1217,m80,BLAKE,"We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate."
40027,L257622,u1217,m80,BLAKE,It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
40028,L257621,u1218,m80,CARTER,Carter.
40029,L257602,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Sweet dreams, Blake."
40030,L257601,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Yes.
40031,L257600,u1218,m80,CARTER,"What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?"
40032,L257599,u1217,m80,BLAKE,"Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael."
40033,L257598,u1218,m80,CARTER,Care to join me?
40034,L257597,u1217,m80,BLAKE,That's it?
40035,L257584,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Charming.
40036,L257583,u1218,m80,CARTER,I can be real stiff.
40037,L257582,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Only the real stiffs.
40038,L257581,u1218,m80,CARTER,You take all your dates here. Blake?
40039,L257551,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten."
40040,L257550,u1217,m80,BLAKE,The cemetery...
40041,L257549,u1218,m80,CARTER,Where?
40042,L257548,u1217,m80,BLAKE,It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
40043,L257547,u1218,m80,CARTER,Carter.
40044,L257490,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Girl scouts.
40045,L257489,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?"
40046,L257488,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
40047,L257487,u1218,m80,CARTER,As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
40048,L257486,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
40049,L257485,u1218,m80,CARTER,The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
40050,L257484,u1218,m80,CARTER,No blood on the knife.
40051,L257483,u1217,m80,BLAKE,"Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect."
40052,L257482,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell."
40053,L257479,u1217,m80,BLAKE,That don't match either of the victim's.
40054,L257478,u1218,m80,CARTER,One set of muddy shoe prints.
40055,L257474,u1218,m80,CARTER,I like a woman who takes control.
40056,L257473,u1217,m80,BLAKE,Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
40057,L257472,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Well, when you put it that way."
40058,L257471,u1217,m80,BLAKE,"Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?"
40059,L257470,u1218,m80,CARTER,"With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers."
40060,L257469,u1217,m80,BLAKE,They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
40061,L257468,u1218,m80,CARTER,Why am I here?
40062,L257467,u1217,m80,BLAKE,It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
40063,L257466,u1218,m80,CARTER,"No thanks, I'm not thirsty."
40064,L257703,u1223,m80,KERI,"Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye."
40065,L257702,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Funny, we just drove right in."
40066,L257701,u1223,m80,KERI,"I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times."
40067,L257700,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate."
40068,L257699,u1223,m80,KERI,... I think it would be best if you both left.
40069,L257698,u1218,m80,CARTER,Carter.
40070,L257697,u1223,m80,KERI,Detective...
40071,L257696,u1218,m80,CARTER,"Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?"
40072,L257695,u1223,m80,KERI,I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
40073,L257694,u1218,m80,CARTER,Mind if we sit down?
40074,L257688,u1223,m80,KERI,Do I know you?
40075,L257687,u1218,m80,CARTER,I'll be damned.
40076,L257639,u1219,m80,DEPUTY CLARK,Doesn't look good.
40077,L257638,u1223,m80,KERI,Think Eddie had something to do with it?
40078,L257637,u1219,m80,DEPUTY CLARK,"Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing."
40079,L257636,u1223,m80,KERI,Do you know who did this?
40080,L257635,u1219,m80,DEPUTY CLARK,Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
40081,L257634,u1223,m80,KERI,My god...
40082,L257633,u1219,m80,DEPUTY CLARK,It's Amy Kramer.
40083,L257632,u1223,m80,KERI,A dead body?
40084,L257631,u1219,m80,DEPUTY CLARK,Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
40085,L257630,u1223,m80,KERI,Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
40086,L257564,u1220,m80,EDDIE,Would somebody shut this guy up?
40087,L257563,u1227,m80,SHANE,Another historical inaccuracy.
40088,L257560,u1227,m80,SHANE,"It's not historically accurate, that's all."
40089,L257559,u1220,m80,EDDIE,"Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?"
40090,L257558,u1227,m80,SHANE,Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
40091,L257557,u1220,m80,EDDIE,What the fuck are you talking about?
40092,L257556,u1227,m80,SHANE,"Besides, it's historically inaccurate."
40093,L257414,u1221,m80,JIMMY,"Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight."
40094,L257413,u1226,m80,PAMELA,My office?
40095,L257412,u1221,m80,JIMMY,Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
40096,L257411,u1226,m80,PAMELA,Nothing's missing?
40097,L257410,u1221,m80,JIMMY,Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
40098,L257409,u1226,m80,PAMELA,You sure?
40099,L257408,u1221,m80,JIMMY,Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
40100,L257404,u1221,m80,JIMMY,And miss the big game?  No way.
40101,L257403,u1226,m80,PAMELA,No.  Wait for the police.
40102,L257402,u1221,m80,JIMMY,Checking out your place.
40103,L257401,u1226,m80,PAMELA,"Jimmy, what are you doing?"
40104,L257398,u1226,m80,PAMELA,No shit.
40105,L257397,u1221,m80,JIMMY,No shit?!
40106,L257396,u1226,m80,PAMELA,I think someone broke into my house.
40107,L257395,u1221,m80,JIMMY,Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
40108,L257394,u1226,m80,PAMELA,My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
40109,L257393,u1221,m80,JIMMY,"Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?"
40110,L257842,u1223,m80,KERI,That would work.
40111,L257841,u1222,m80,JOHN,Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
40112,L257840,u1223,m80,KERI,"Call me Laurie, will ya?"
40113,L257839,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Yeah, me too, Keri."
40114,L257815,u1223,m80,KERI,"Please, get on the bus..."
40115,L257814,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Oh, God... no... not Molly."
40116,L257813,u1223,m80,KERI,John...
40117,L257812,u1222,m80,JOHN,What?  Where is she?
40118,L257811,u1223,m80,KERI,"John, you can't help her now."
40119,L257810,u1222,m80,JOHN,I'm not leaving without her.
40120,L257809,u1223,m80,KERI,Just get on the bus.
40121,L257808,u1222,m80,JOHN,Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
40122,L257807,u1223,m80,KERI,Get on the bus.
40123,L257806,u1222,m80,JOHN,"He found you, didn't he?"
40124,L257750,u1222,m80,JOHN,I don't know.
40125,L257749,u1223,m80,KERI,Where are you going?
40126,L257748,u1223,m80,KERI,I was trying to protect you from this...
40127,L257747,u1222,m80,JOHN,Why didn't you tell me?
40128,L257746,u1223,m80,KERI,No.
40129,L257745,u1222,m80,JOHN,Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
40130,L257744,u1223,m80,KERI,Yes.
40131,L257743,u1222,m80,JOHN,Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
40132,L257738,u1223,m80,KERI,"Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family."
40133,L257737,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Now you're joking, right?"
40134,L257732,u1223,m80,KERI,I was trying to get away from someone.
40135,L257731,u1222,m80,JOHN,You some kind of fugitive or something?
40136,L257726,u1223,m80,KERI,"Will, sit down..."
40137,L257725,u1222,m80,JOHN,"I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke."
40138,L257612,u1222,m80,JOHN,Just forget it...
40139,L257611,u1223,m80,KERI,"Oh, so now it's my fault?"
40140,L257610,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends."
40141,L257609,u1223,m80,KERI,It's an option.
40142,L257608,u1222,m80,JOHN,Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
40143,L257607,u1223,m80,KERI,Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
40144,L257606,u1222,m80,JOHN,I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
40145,L257605,u1223,m80,KERI,"You're kidding with that answer, right?"
40146,L257604,u1222,m80,JOHN,Nothing.
40147,L257603,u1223,m80,KERI,"Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!"
40148,L257443,u1223,m80,KERI,I know.
40149,L257442,u1222,m80,JOHN,You're twisted.
40150,L257441,u1223,m80,KERI,I thought you'd never ask.
40151,L257440,u1222,m80,JOHN,To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
40152,L257439,u1223,m80,KERI,Where are you going?
40153,L257437,u1222,m80,JOHN,My life is a living hell.
40154,L257436,u1223,m80,KERI,I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
40155,L257435,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster."
40156,L257434,u1223,m80,KERI,"My point exactly.  See, we both agree."
40157,L257433,u1222,m80,JOHN,"The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?"
40158,L257432,u1223,m80,KERI,Forget it.
40159,L257431,u1222,m80,JOHN,I promise not to run off to Cancun.
40160,L257430,u1223,m80,KERI,You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
40161,L257429,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Well, Dad thinks it's okay."
40162,L257428,u1223,m80,KERI,No.
40163,L257427,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?"
40164,L257426,u1223,m80,KERI,"And I should have a son who calls me ""Mom"".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck."
40165,L257425,u1222,m80,JOHN,"I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want."
40166,L257424,u1223,m80,KERI,Betcha' didn't predict that.
40167,L257423,u1222,m80,JOHN,What the --
40168,L257422,u1222,m80,JOHN,You're so predictable.
40169,L257421,u1223,m80,KERI,"Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still ""no."""
40170,L257661,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Yeah.
40171,L257660,u1222,m80,JOHN,Better?
40172,L257659,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Here, take my jacket."
40173,L257658,u1225,m80,MOLLY,I'm okay.
40174,L257657,u1222,m80,JOHN,You look kind of cold.
40175,L257656,u1225,m80,MOLLY,I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
40176,L257655,u1222,m80,JOHN,You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
40177,L257654,u1225,m80,MOLLY,You really think Eddie killed her?
40178,L257653,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
40179,L257652,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Well, I'm not going until I talk to you."
40180,L257651,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Then I'll get caught.
40181,L257650,u1222,m80,JOHN,Then you come out here.
40182,L257649,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
40183,L257648,u1222,m80,JOHN,Can I come in?
40184,L257647,u1225,m80,MOLLY,I can see that.  Why?
40185,L257646,u1222,m80,JOHN,I came to see you.
40186,L257645,u1225,m80,MOLLY,What are you doing here?!
40187,L257626,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
40188,L257625,u1222,m80,JOHN,"Nah, I didn't tell her where I went."
40189,L257517,u1225,m80,MOLLY,I can't afford to get caught.
40190,L257516,u1222,m80,JOHN,Why not?
40191,L257515,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Not me.
40192,L257512,u1222,m80,JOHN,I borrowed it.
40193,L257511,u1225,m80,MOLLY,You stole it?
40194,L257510,u1222,m80,JOHN,Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
40195,L257509,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Where'd you get it?
40196,L257508,u1222,m80,JOHN,Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
40197,L257718,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Michael Meyers!
40198,L257717,u1223,m80,KERI,Who?!
40199,L257716,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Linda!  He killed Linda!
40200,L257667,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Okay... thank you.
40201,L257666,u1223,m80,KERI,"Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night."
40202,L257665,u1225,m80,MOLLY,"I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here."
40203,L257664,u1223,m80,KERI,"Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?"
40204,L257818,u1228,m80,WILL,I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
40205,L257817,u1223,m80,KERI,We've got to get these kids out of here...
40206,L257816,u1228,m80,WILL,"Keri, you all right?"
40207,L257794,u1228,m80,WILL,Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
40208,L257793,u1223,m80,KERI,I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
40209,L257792,u1228,m80,WILL,"Oh, right.  Sorry."
40210,L257791,u1223,m80,KERI,"Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will."
40211,L257756,u1228,m80,WILL,Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
40212,L257755,u1223,m80,KERI,Yeah.
40213,L257754,u1228,m80,WILL,So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
40214,L257753,u1228,m80,WILL,Never.
40215,L257752,u1223,m80,KERI,"Are you going to leave, too?"
40216,L257751,u1228,m80,WILL,You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
40217,L257742,u1223,m80,KERI,Shit happens.
40218,L257741,u1228,m80,WILL,I can't believe this is happening.
40219,L257740,u1223,m80,KERI,"No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth."
40220,L257736,u1223,m80,KERI,He's my brother.
40221,L257735,u1228,m80,WILL,The serial killer?
40222,L257734,u1223,m80,KERI,Michael Meyers.
40223,L257733,u1228,m80,WILL,Who?
40224,L257730,u1228,m80,WILL,You're right.  It does sound strange.
40225,L257729,u1223,m80,KERI,My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
40226,L257728,u1228,m80,WILL,What?
40227,L257727,u1223,m80,KERI,There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
40228,L257619,u1223,m80,KERI,I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
40229,L257618,u1228,m80,WILL,What are you looking at?
40230,L257617,u1223,m80,KERI,What?
40231,L257616,u1228,m80,WILL,"Hey, you alright?"
40232,L257544,u1223,m80,KERI,Bye Will.
40233,L257543,u1228,m80,WILL,A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
40234,L257542,u1223,m80,KERI,I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
40235,L257540,u1228,m80,WILL,Doesn't make it bad advice.
40236,L257539,u1223,m80,KERI,"Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?"
40237,L257538,u1228,m80,WILL,"The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free."
40238,L257537,u1223,m80,KERI,It's not going to happen.
40239,L257536,u1228,m80,WILL,This kid just wants his freedom.
40240,L257535,u1223,m80,KERI,He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
40241,L257534,u1228,m80,WILL,Still wants to move out?
40242,L257533,u1223,m80,KERI,It's always John.
40243,L257532,u1228,m80,WILL,"It's John, isn't it?"
40244,L257530,u1223,m80,KERI,Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
40245,L257529,u1228,m80,WILL,You okay?  You seem a little off.
40246,L257528,u1223,m80,KERI,Looks great.  It does.
40247,L257527,u1228,m80,WILL,Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
40248,L257785,u1224,m80,LINDA,Can't you?
40249,L257784,u1227,m80,SHANE,Can't you hold it?
40250,L257783,u1224,m80,LINDA,I have to pee.
40251,L257782,u1227,m80,SHANE,What is it?
40252,L257781,u1224,m80,LINDA,Wait.
40253,L257624,u1227,m80,SHANE,You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
40254,L257623,u1224,m80,LINDA,"Look, they're staring right at us."
40255,L257776,u1224,m80,LINDA,"Oh, don't be such a victim."
40256,L257775,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Have enough fun for the both of us.
40257,L257774,u1224,m80,LINDA,Let the party begin.
40258,L257773,u1224,m80,LINDA,Very insightful.
40259,L257772,u1225,m80,MOLLY,But the dance is in the gymnasium.
40260,L257771,u1224,m80,LINDA,Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
40261,L257770,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Where's Shane?
40262,L257769,u1224,m80,LINDA,Thanks!
40263,L257768,u1225,m80,MOLLY,"Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus."
40264,L257767,u1224,m80,LINDA,"Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?"
40265,L257766,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
40266,L257765,u1224,m80,LINDA,You're so easy...
40267,L257764,u1225,m80,MOLLY,"Shit, Linda!"
40268,L257763,u1224,m80,LINDA,BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
40269,L257714,u1224,m80,LINDA,"Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing."
40270,L257713,u1225,m80,MOLLY,You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
40271,L257712,u1224,m80,LINDA,I'll pop a Benadryl.
40272,L257711,u1225,m80,MOLLY,I thought you were allergic to latex.
40273,L257710,u1224,m80,LINDA,Shane's going as a condom.
40274,L257679,u1225,m80,MOLLY,Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
40275,L257678,u1224,m80,LINDA,"Ooooh, busted."
40276,L257628,u1225,m80,MOLLY,You're unbelievable.
40277,L257627,u1224,m80,LINDA,Better her than me.
40278,L257507,u1224,m80,LINDA,"You say, ""The key to my heart,"" and I'm gonna hurl."
40279,L257506,u1225,m80,MOLLY,What's this?
40280,L257494,u1225,m80,MOLLY,He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
40281,L257493,u1224,m80,LINDA,Fuckin' A.
40282,L257492,u1225,m80,MOLLY,I did alright.
40283,L257491,u1224,m80,LINDA,"You aced it, didn't you?"
40284,L261202,u1229,m81,BETH,He's in the bathroom.
40285,L261201,u1235,m81,KARA,Is Tim there?
40286,L261200,u1229,m81,BETH,We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
40287,L261199,u1235,m81,KARA,What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
40288,L261198,u1229,m81,BETH,"Kara? ... No, this is Beth."
40289,L261197,u1235,m81,KARA,Mom -- Who is this?
40290,L260951,u1229,m81,BETH,"You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely."
40291,L260950,u1235,m81,KARA,No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
40292,L260949,u1229,m81,BETH,Why?  You interested?
40293,L260948,u1235,m81,KARA,"Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?"
40294,L260939,u1229,m81,BETH,Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
40295,L260938,u1235,m81,KARA,Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
40296,L260937,u1229,m81,BETH,He do that to you?
40297,L261194,u1229,m81,BETH,What if it's Kara?
40298,L261193,u1237,m81,TIM,Answer what?
40299,L261192,u1229,m81,BETH,Aren't you gonna answer that?
40300,L261191,u1237,m81,TIM,Then they can watch.
40301,L261190,u1229,m81,BETH,What if your parents come home?
40302,L261189,u1237,m81,TIM,Guess so ...
40303,L261188,u1229,m81,BETH,Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
40304,L261167,u1229,m81,BETH,We can light our own tree at home.
40305,L261166,u1237,m81,TIM,But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
40306,L261165,u1229,m81,BETH,Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
40307,L261164,u1237,m81,TIM,Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
40308,L261163,u1229,m81,BETH,"Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy."
40309,L261083,u1237,m81,TIM,Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
40310,L261082,u1229,m81,BETH,Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
40311,L260959,u1229,m81,BETH,Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
40312,L260958,u1237,m81,TIM,Happy fuckin' Halloween.
40313,L260946,u1229,m81,BETH,"Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995."
40314,L260945,u1237,m81,TIM,Whatever happened to women in back?
40315,L260941,u1237,m81,TIM,"Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween."
40316,L260940,u1229,m81,BETH,"Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do."
40317,L261274,u1235,m81,KARA,Danny!!!
40318,L261273,u1230,m81,DANNY,Mommy!!!
40319,L261186,u1235,m81,KARA,I promise.
40320,L261185,u1230,m81,DANNY,Promise?
40321,L261184,u1235,m81,KARA,No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
40322,L261183,u1230,m81,DANNY,I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
40323,L261182,u1235,m81,KARA,"There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep."
40324,L261181,u1230,m81,DANNY,"Mommy, I'm scared."
40325,L261102,u1235,m81,KARA,"Danny, you're just going to have to wait!"
40326,L261101,u1230,m81,DANNY,"Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!"
40327,L261097,u1235,m81,KARA,You can't expect us to stay here --
40328,L261096,u1230,m81,DANNY,"Mom, I want to go to the fair ..."
40329,L260835,u1235,m81,KARA,Okay ... But just for tonight.
40330,L260834,u1230,m81,DANNY,"No, Mom -- keep it on!"
40331,L260832,u1235,m81,KARA,Like what?
40332,L260831,u1230,m81,DANNY,He says things.  Bad things.
40333,L260830,u1235,m81,KARA,You've been watching too much TV.
40334,L260829,u1230,m81,DANNY,But I've seen him!
40335,L260828,u1235,m81,KARA,"They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?"
40336,L260827,u1230,m81,DANNY,The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
40337,L260826,u1235,m81,KARA,Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
40338,L260819,u1230,m81,DANNY,The voice man!  He's here!
40339,L260818,u1235,m81,KARA,Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
40340,L261057,u1231,m81,DEBRA,"You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew."
40341,L261056,u1234,m81,JOHN,"Debra, you're fuckin' insane."
40342,L261055,u1231,m81,DEBRA,"I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us."
40343,L261054,u1234,m81,JOHN,"What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?"
40344,L261053,u1231,m81,DEBRA,"John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!"
40345,L261052,u1234,m81,JOHN,What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
40346,L261051,u1231,m81,DEBRA,He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
40347,L261050,u1231,m81,DEBRA,A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
40348,L261049,u1234,m81,JOHN,What is it this time?
40349,L260917,u1231,m81,DEBRA,"You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara."
40350,L260916,u1234,m81,JOHN,See what I'm talkin' about?
40351,L260915,u1234,m81,JOHN,"Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect."
40352,L260914,u1231,m81,DEBRA,"Relax, John.  They were just kids."
40353,L260913,u1234,m81,JOHN,Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
40354,L261044,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did."
40355,L261043,u1231,m81,DEBRA,God ... this can't be true.
40356,L261042,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
40357,L261041,u1231,m81,DEBRA,What should I do?
40358,L261035,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
40359,L261034,u1231,m81,DEBRA,Jamie?  But I thought she was --
40360,L261033,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter."
40361,L261032,u1231,m81,DEBRA,What makes you think he'll come here again?
40362,L261031,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
40363,L261024,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,I've come to help your family.
40364,L261023,u1231,m81,DEBRA,Who are you?
40365,L261022,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
40366,L260963,u1233,m81,JAMIE,It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
40367,L260962,u1232,m81,HARRY SIMMS,"Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?"
40368,L260961,u1233,m81,JAMIE,"No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby."
40369,L260960,u1232,m81,HARRY SIMMS,So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
40370,L260891,u1233,m81,JAMIE,It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
40371,L260890,u1232,m81,HARRY SIMMS,"Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?"
40372,L260889,u1233,m81,JAMIE,No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
40373,L260888,u1232,m81,HARRY SIMMS,So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
40374,L261280,u1238,m81,TOMMY,It's not working!
40375,L261279,u1235,m81,KARA,Come on!
40376,L261278,u1238,m81,TOMMY,Wait a minute ...
40377,L261277,u1235,m81,KARA,What now?!
40378,L261232,u1238,m81,TOMMY,"Kara, no!"
40379,L261231,u1235,m81,KARA,"Danny!  Danny, where are you?!"
40380,L261222,u1238,m81,TOMMY,He's gone.
40381,L261221,u1235,m81,KARA,Where's the baby?!
40382,L261132,u1238,m81,TOMMY,"Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --"
40383,L261131,u1235,m81,KARA,Danny?!  Danny!
40384,L261129,u1238,m81,TOMMY,To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
40385,L261128,u1235,m81,KARA,Where are you going?
40386,L261127,u1238,m81,TOMMY,"'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'"
40387,L261126,u1235,m81,KARA,Halloween.
40388,L261125,u1238,m81,TOMMY,"Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'"
40389,L261124,u1235,m81,KARA,"Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic."
40390,L261111,u1235,m81,KARA,It's a rune ... Thorn.
40391,L261110,u1238,m81,TOMMY,It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
40392,L261109,u1238,m81,TOMMY,Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
40393,L261108,u1235,m81,KARA,Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
40394,L261107,u1238,m81,TOMMY,Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
40395,L261105,u1235,m81,KARA,Here.  Let me try.
40396,L261104,u1238,m81,TOMMY,"God, what's wrong with him?"
40397,L261100,u1238,m81,TOMMY,Him.
40398,L261099,u1235,m81,KARA,Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
40399,L261075,u1235,m81,KARA,You stay away from him!
40400,L261074,u1238,m81,TOMMY,I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
40401,L261073,u1235,m81,KARA,"My, God!  What have you done to him?"
40402,L261071,u1235,m81,KARA,"Danny, go downstairs -- Now!"
40403,L261070,u1238,m81,TOMMY,She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
40404,L261271,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Leave the boy.  Take me.
40405,L261270,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Stay away, Sam."
40406,L261269,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,No!!!
40407,L261256,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive."
40408,L261255,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,You've created a monster.
40409,L261249,u1239,m81,WYNN,"And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you."
40410,L261248,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Samhain.
40411,L261247,u1239,m81,WYNN,There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
40412,L261246,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Jamie's baby ...
40413,L261245,u1239,m81,WYNN,"She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny."
40414,L261244,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Why did you take Jamie?
40415,L261243,u1239,m81,WYNN,Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
40416,L261242,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,It was you.
40417,L261241,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell."
40418,L261240,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"This is madness, Wynn."
40419,L261239,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice."
40420,L261238,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you."
40421,L261237,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Where's the child?
40422,L261093,u1239,m81,WYNN,I'll meet you over there.
40423,L261092,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
40424,L261089,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
40425,L261088,u1239,m81,WYNN,No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
40426,L261087,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Any word on the location of the Strodes?
40427,L261086,u1239,m81,WYNN,There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
40428,L261019,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,An old friend.
40429,L261018,u1239,m81,WYNN,There you are.  Who was that boy?
40430,L260996,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to."
40431,L260995,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Sam, don't -- let them take care of her."
40432,L260974,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,It's a sign.  He's come home.
40433,L260973,u1239,m81,WYNN,What is that?
40434,L260911,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Or what's left of him.
40435,L260910,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back."
40436,L260906,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him."
40437,L260905,u1239,m81,WYNN,"After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --"
40438,L260904,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well."
40439,L260903,u1239,m81,WYNN,You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
40440,L260902,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
40441,L260887,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind."
40442,L260886,u1239,m81,WYNN,"But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over."
40443,L260880,u1239,m81,WYNN,"You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference."
40444,L260879,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
40445,L260878,u1239,m81,WYNN,"We need you, Dr. Loomis."
40446,L260875,u1239,m81,WYNN,Retiring.
40447,L260874,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,But surely Rogers isn't --
40448,L260873,u1239,m81,WYNN,"As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff."
40449,L260872,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
40450,L260871,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink."
40451,L260868,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
40452,L260867,u1239,m81,WYNN,"Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!"
40453,L261229,u1238,m81,TOMMY,No!!!
40454,L261228,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!"
40455,L261226,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
40456,L261225,u1238,m81,TOMMY,No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
40457,L261224,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,No one.
40458,L261223,u1238,m81,TOMMY,Who else knew I had the baby?!
40459,L261014,u1238,m81,TOMMY,"No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night."
40460,L261013,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
40461,L261012,u1238,m81,TOMMY,I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
40462,L261011,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,What do you know about Michael?
40463,L261010,u1238,m81,TOMMY,Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
40464,L261009,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
40465,L261008,u1238,m81,TOMMY,I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
40466,L261007,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,"I'm sorry, but do I know you --"
40467,L261006,u1238,m81,TOMMY,"Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie."
40468,L261005,u1236,m81,LOOMIS,Yes?
40469,L268150,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Goodbye, Looseleaf."
40470,L268149,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, ""Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much."" You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one."
40471,L268148,u1240,m82,HAROLD,They were enemies.  We were at war.
40472,L268147,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, ""Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."""
40473,L268146,u1240,m82,HAROLD,If what?
40474,L268145,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I don't think so.  It could have been.
40475,L268144,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!"
40476,L268143,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
40477,L268142,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Everybody thinks that.
40478,L268141,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I know you think that.
40479,L268140,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're an imbecile.
40480,L268139,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Okay.  Okay.
40481,L268138,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You.
40482,L268137,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Me?
40483,L268136,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Maybe it's time you got out.
40484,L268135,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, ""Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again."" That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, ""Jesus--who could blame her?"""
40485,L268134,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You did?
40486,L268133,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You never played a violin.
40487,L268132,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Tit for tat--as simple as that.
40488,L268131,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
40489,L268130,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"In what way, pray tell?"
40490,L268129,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
40491,L268128,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What's this?
40492,L268127,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
40493,L268090,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!"
40494,L268089,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"Hi, Penelope."
40495,L268071,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead."
40496,L268070,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I dunno.
40497,L268069,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
40498,L268068,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
40499,L268067,u1240,m82,HAROLD,All the more reason to go to Africa.
40500,L268066,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
40501,L268065,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
40502,L268064,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I dunno.
40503,L268063,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
40504,L268051,u1240,m82,HAROLD,He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
40505,L268050,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?"
40506,L268043,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"You keep on saying ""deep"" and ""deeply."" I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime."
40507,L268042,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected."
40508,L268041,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
40509,L268027,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
40510,L268026,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
40511,L268025,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I didn't know we had any women left.
40512,L268024,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women."
40513,L268023,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
40514,L268022,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare."
40515,L268021,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore."
40516,L268020,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
40517,L268019,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Go to the funeral?
40518,L267948,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Sorry.
40519,L267947,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, ""Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."""
40520,L267946,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Really?
40521,L267945,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
40522,L267944,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Oh.  I'd forgotten.
40523,L267943,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
40524,L267942,u1240,m82,HAROLD,When?
40525,L267941,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You told me.
40526,L267940,u1240,m82,HAROLD,How do you know that?
40527,L267939,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
40528,L267938,u1240,m82,HAROLD,He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
40529,L267937,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Huh.
40530,L267936,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern."
40531,L267935,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Excuse me.
40532,L267930,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"You know me, boy."
40533,L267929,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What's funny about that?
40534,L267928,u1240,m82,HAROLD,She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
40535,L267927,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
40536,L267926,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The educational process.
40537,L267925,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"I dunno, boy."
40538,L267898,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"How about breakfast, wife?"
40539,L267897,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,First Nagasaki--now this.
40540,L267896,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Could have happened to anybody.
40541,L267883,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
40542,L267882,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Otherwise, how are things?"
40543,L267875,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Let's talk about something else.
40544,L267874,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And how were things?
40545,L267871,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Haven't got one.
40546,L267870,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
40547,L267869,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You ever own a motorcycle?
40548,L267868,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Go home!
40549,L267867,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I've been looking at motorcycles.
40550,L267504,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I'm lonesome already.
40551,L267503,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways."
40552,L267502,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Months?
40553,L267501,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!"
40554,L267500,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!"
40555,L267498,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
40556,L267497,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful."
40557,L267496,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,How short the skirts are.
40558,L267495,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Let's talk about it some other time.
40559,L267494,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You know what gets me?
40560,L267493,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"So long, Colonel."
40561,L267492,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was."
40562,L267491,u1240,m82,HAROLD,That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
40563,L267490,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I'm liable to find anything!
40564,L267489,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Go home.
40565,L267488,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch."
40566,L267487,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Go home!
40567,L267486,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
40568,L267485,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
40569,L267484,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,What'll you do for transportation?
40570,L267483,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care."
40571,L267482,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Can I have the Cadillac?
40572,L267481,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
40573,L267480,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
40574,L267479,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The hell with the diamonds!
40575,L267478,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
40576,L267477,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Go home!
40577,L267476,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You know what gets me?
40578,L267475,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people."
40579,L267474,u1240,m82,HAROLD,This room is full of ghosts.
40580,L267473,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there."
40581,L267472,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler."
40582,L267471,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I didn't tell you everything.
40583,L267470,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!"
40584,L267469,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"You don't know my mother-in-law, boy."
40585,L267468,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Tell them yourself!
40586,L267467,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
40587,L267466,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
40588,L267465,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
40589,L267464,u1240,m82,HAROLD,At least!
40590,L267463,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,At least we found the diamonds.
40591,L267462,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
40592,L267461,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"How everybody says ""fuck"" and ""shit"" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say ""fuck"" or ""shit"" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says ""fuck"" and ""shit,"" ""fuck"" and ""shit"" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country."
40593,L267460,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Oh, shit."
40594,L267459,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You know what gets me?
40595,L267458,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You know what gets me?
40596,L267457,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Home.
40597,L267456,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Must have changed that law.
40598,L267455,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I suppose.
40599,L267454,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"Used to be against the law, didn't it?"
40600,L267453,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Um.
40601,L267452,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,How all the magazines show tits today.
40602,L267451,u1240,m82,HAROLD,No.
40603,L267450,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,You know what gets me?
40604,L267449,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Home is important to a man.
40605,L267448,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
40606,L267447,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young."
40607,L267446,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We'll see.
40608,L267445,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week."
40609,L267444,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Home, sweet home."
40610,L267443,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I'm gonna wet my pants.
40611,L267442,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
40612,L267441,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
40613,L267440,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We've never met.
40614,L267439,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Didn't recognize you.
40615,L267438,u1240,m82,HAROLD,A bitch.
40616,L267437,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,It's a bitch.
40617,L267436,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Hm?
40618,L267435,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"I dunno, boy."
40619,L267434,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Miss me, baby?"
40620,L268177,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Thank God!
40621,L268176,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out."
40622,L268175,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Out!
40623,L268174,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew."
40624,L268173,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Out!  Out!
40625,L268172,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You're my buddy.
40626,L268171,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!"
40627,L268170,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
40628,L268169,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one."
40629,L268168,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
40630,L268167,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"You're hollow, like a woman."
40631,L268166,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I wouldn't drop my gun.
40632,L268165,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
40633,L268164,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Gee whiz--
40634,L268163,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive."
40635,L268162,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,What went wrong?
40636,L268161,u1240,m82,HAROLD,To make an ass of yourself.
40637,L268160,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You invited me.
40638,L268159,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
40639,L268158,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,For Africa.
40640,L268157,u1240,m82,HAROLD,For what?
40641,L268156,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,We got to get another pilot.
40642,L268155,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What?
40643,L268154,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
40644,L268124,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!"
40645,L268123,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out."
40646,L268118,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things."
40647,L268117,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
40648,L268116,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'm interested in long-term expectations.
40649,L268115,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You're making a joke.
40650,L268114,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Fifty years?
40651,L268085,u1240,m82,HAROLD,That can be arranged.
40652,L268084,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I just want one true adventure before I die.
40653,L268083,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
40654,L268082,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I've considered that.
40655,L268081,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa."
40656,L268080,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Get used to it.  Back door, Paul."
40657,L268079,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,What an awful sound!
40658,L268077,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You actually sold insurance!
40659,L268076,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Insurance!
40660,L268060,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Pass the fucking catsup.
40661,L268059,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"What you say is, ""Pass the fucking catsup."""
40662,L268058,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
40663,L268057,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
40664,L268056,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
40665,L268049,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
40666,L268048,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Blue soup.
40667,L268047,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup."
40668,L268046,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
40669,L268045,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Our pleasure.
40670,L268044,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
40671,L268037,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
40672,L268036,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I forget mine for years on end.
40673,L268035,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
40674,L268034,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You've come to the right man.
40675,L268033,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I wanted to apologize.
40676,L268032,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The posies are for her?
40677,L268031,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Is Penelope in?
40678,L268030,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"How are you, honeybunch?"
40679,L268029,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Hello.
40680,L268251,u1243,m82,PAUL,Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
40681,L268250,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'm talking to you gently now.
40682,L268249,u1243,m82,PAUL,"I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same."
40683,L268241,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin."
40684,L268240,u1243,m82,PAUL,"It's your house, Dad."
40685,L268239,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
40686,L268238,u1243,m82,PAUL,I don't want to fight you.
40687,L268237,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?"
40688,L268219,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`"
40689,L268218,u1243,m82,PAUL,Dad--
40690,L268217,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!"

40692,L268215,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
40693,L268214,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it."
40694,L268213,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Open the bolt!
40695,L268212,u1243,m82,PAUL,No.
40696,L268211,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
40697,L268210,u1243,m82,PAUL,No.
40698,L268209,u1240,m82,HAROLD,That's a rifle you have?

40704,L268087,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Who was it?

40706,L268055,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word."

40708,L268053,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?"

40710,L267913,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.

40736,L267737,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
40737,L267736,u1243,m82,PAUL,I can't take my eyes off you.
40738,L267735,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Why don't you go to bed--son.
40739,L267734,u1243,m82,PAUL,She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
40740,L267733,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
40741,L267732,u1243,m82,PAUL,Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
40742,L267731,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt."
40743,L267683,u1243,m82,PAUL,Sir?
40744,L267682,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home."
40745,L267630,u1243,m82,PAUL,"Go ahead.  No, no, no, no."
40746,L267629,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may."
40747,L267628,u1243,m82,PAUL,"No, no, no, no, no."
40748,L267627,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're a very good boy to respond that way.
40749,L267626,u1243,m82,PAUL,"Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing."
40750,L267625,u1240,m82,HAROLD,He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
40751,L267624,u1243,m82,PAUL,They're not engaged.
40752,L267623,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
40753,L267622,u1243,m82,PAUL,"Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players."
40754,L267621,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're supposed to get hurt!
40755,L267620,u1243,m82,PAUL,"I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt."
40756,L267619,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?"
40757,L267618,u1243,m82,PAUL,Sir?
40758,L267617,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
40759,L267616,u1243,m82,PAUL,"When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch."
40760,L267615,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
40761,L267614,u1243,m82,PAUL,Mhravitch.
40762,L267613,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
40763,L267611,u1243,m82,PAUL,"And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, ""Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."""
40764,L267610,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
40765,L267609,u1243,m82,PAUL,Where did you get the poison?
40766,L267608,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there."
40767,L267607,u1243,m82,PAUL,Go on.
40768,L267606,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
40769,L267605,u1243,m82,PAUL,I don't know.
40770,L267604,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
40771,L267603,u1243,m82,PAUL,Uck.
40772,L267602,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound."
40773,L267601,u1243,m82,PAUL,Mhravitch.
40774,L267600,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
40775,L267599,u1243,m82,PAUL,Wow.
40776,L267598,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia."
40777,L267597,u1243,m82,PAUL,Tell me that!  Tell me that!
40778,L267596,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand."
40779,L267595,u1243,m82,PAUL,Tell me that.
40780,L267594,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
40781,L267593,u1243,m82,PAUL,"""The sting."""
40782,L267592,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"As in ""Death, where is thy sting?"" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more."
40783,L267591,u1243,m82,PAUL,"""The sting."""
40784,L267590,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him ""La Picadura""--""the sting."""
40785,L267589,u1243,m82,PAUL,Dad was never in England?
40786,L267588,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Oh hell.
40787,L267587,u1243,m82,PAUL,England?
40788,L267586,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"""Dad?""  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country."
40789,L267585,u1243,m82,PAUL,Tell me some true stories about Dad.
40790,L267584,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise."
40791,L267583,u1243,m82,PAUL,He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
40792,L267582,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure."
40793,L267581,u1243,m82,PAUL,Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
40794,L267580,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What does he do--of an athletic nature?
40795,L267579,u1243,m82,PAUL,"""Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."""
40796,L267578,u1240,m82,HAROLD,No.
40797,L267577,u1243,m82,PAUL,"He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?"
40798,L267576,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It makes life spicy.
40799,L267575,u1243,m82,PAUL,What's good about that?
40800,L267574,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Excellent!
40801,L267573,u1243,m82,PAUL,He insults him all the time.
40802,L267572,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?"
40803,L267571,u1243,m82,PAUL,She has a master's degree in English literature.
40804,L267570,u1240,m82,HAROLD,College?
40805,L267569,u1243,m82,PAUL,They were in the same creative writing class.
40806,L267568,u1240,m82,HAROLD,College!
40807,L267567,u1243,m82,PAUL,She met him at college.
40808,L267566,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--"
40809,L267565,u1243,m82,PAUL,He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
40810,L267564,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
40811,L267563,u1243,m82,PAUL,He worships Father.
40812,L267562,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Even this--""Herb Shuttle"", you said?"
40813,L267561,u1243,m82,PAUL,Everybody says he was so brave.
40814,L267560,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Man and boy.
40815,L267559,u1243,m82,PAUL,"I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?"
40816,L267558,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
40817,L267557,u1243,m82,PAUL,I'll see.
40818,L267556,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
40819,L267555,u1243,m82,PAUL,"She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess."
40820,L267554,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
40821,L267553,u1243,m82,PAUL,Where's Mom?
40822,L267552,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
40823,L267551,u1243,m82,PAUL,Is anybody besides you here now?
40824,L267550,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
40825,L267549,u1243,m82,PAUL,Dr. Woodly.
40826,L267548,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago."
40827,L267547,u1243,m82,PAUL,Do you mind if I ask who you are?
40828,L267546,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Life has denied me that thrill.
40829,L267545,u1243,m82,PAUL,Do you know who Wanda June is?
40830,L267544,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Ask it!
40831,L267543,u1243,m82,PAUL,Are you--do you--
40832,L267542,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You were about to ask a question?
40833,L267541,u1243,m82,PAUL,Are you--
40834,L267540,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Hello.
40835,L267539,u1243,m82,PAUL,Hello.
40836,L267538,u1240,m82,HAROLD,As a matter of fact--I am home.
40837,L267537,u1243,m82,PAUL,Sir?
40838,L267536,u1240,m82,HAROLD,As a matter of fact--
40839,L267535,u1243,m82,PAUL,Anybody home?
40840,L268318,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Do it, Norbert."
40841,L268317,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
40842,L268316,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go."
40843,L268315,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!"
40844,L268314,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You've killed women?
40845,L268313,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?"
40846,L268309,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Out!
40847,L268308,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say."
40848,L268305,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool."
40849,L268304,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The National Safety Council would be appalled.
40850,L268303,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
40851,L268300,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Load it for her.
40852,L268299,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,How do I load?
40853,L268298,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,There it is.  Give it to me.
40854,L268297,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Help your mother find the bullet.
40855,L268296,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Where's the bullet?
40856,L268295,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun."
40857,L268294,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I mean it!
40858,L268293,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way."
40859,L268292,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone."
40860,L268291,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Ah!  The lady is armed.
40861,L268290,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
40862,L268281,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking."
40863,L268280,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?"
40864,L268271,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Stop!
40865,L268270,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,This is suicide.  Go get the police.
40866,L268263,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Don't!
40867,L268262,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm going to call the police.
40868,L268248,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"You hope this, too?"
40869,L268247,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
40870,L268246,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?"
40871,L268245,u1240,m82,HAROLD,No.
40872,L268244,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,No.
40873,L268243,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here."
40874,L268242,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore."
40875,L268235,u1240,m82,HAROLD,May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
40876,L268234,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all."
40877,L268233,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"If you've lived a good life, fought well--"
40878,L268232,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed."
40879,L268231,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What a handsome word.
40880,L268230,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Honor, I suppose."
40881,L268229,u1240,m82,HAROLD,If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
40882,L268228,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,No you don't.
40883,L268227,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I plan to live one hundred years!
40884,L268226,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
40885,L268225,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'm teaching my son to be a man.
40886,L268224,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
40887,L268223,u1240,m82,HAROLD,If he thinks he's man enough.
40888,L268222,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You're begging him to kill you?
40889,L268221,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy."
40890,L268220,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He's a child!
40891,L268204,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
40892,L268203,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Like what?
40893,L268202,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!"
40894,L268201,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Sounds quite beautiful.
40895,L268200,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang ""Oh Promise Me."" Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to ""Oh Promise Me""?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender."
40896,L268199,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Blue soup?
40897,L268198,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
40898,L268197,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,It seems highly intelligent to me.
40899,L268196,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?"
40900,L268195,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain."
40901,L268194,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Last I heard, his mother was going alone."
40902,L268193,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
40903,L268192,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
40904,L268191,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Rifle?
40905,L268190,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up."
40906,L268189,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
40907,L268188,u1240,m82,HAROLD,See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
40908,L268186,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I see.
40909,L268185,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know."
40910,L268183,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
40911,L268182,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
40912,L268181,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Just one favor.
40913,L268180,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye."
40914,L268179,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Almost a Christmas scene.
40915,L268178,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Well--what have we here?  A family.
40916,L268122,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
40917,L268121,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Things.
40918,L268112,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Hope.
40919,L268111,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
40920,L268110,u1240,m82,HAROLD,He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
40921,L268109,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Two hundred years old.
40922,L268108,u1240,m82,HAROLD,About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
40923,L268107,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He cried.
40924,L268106,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions."
40925,L268105,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He knows you shattered his violin.
40926,L268104,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?"
40927,L268103,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Unless she has nerve.
40928,L268102,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything."
40929,L268101,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Did you like it, dear?"
40930,L268100,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It's a big and busy funeral home.
40931,L268099,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,A dozen?
40932,L268098,u1240,m82,HAROLD,He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
40933,L268097,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"You took him to the funeral, I hear."
40934,L268096,u1240,m82,HAROLD,If he wants to go.
40935,L268095,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I came for Paul as well.
40936,L268094,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
40937,L268093,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use."
40938,L268092,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Sneaking in the back door.
40939,L268091,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I came for my clothes.
40940,L267984,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
40941,L267983,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Why not?
40942,L267982,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,No you're not!
40943,L267981,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin."
40944,L267980,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What are you going to do?
40945,L267979,u1240,m82,HAROLD,That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
40946,L267978,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I don't think so.
40947,L267977,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And no one's there now?
40948,L267976,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Yes.
40949,L267975,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And he keeps it in his apartment?
40950,L267974,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess."
40951,L267973,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And what is his most cherished possession?
40952,L267972,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Yes.
40953,L267971,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The doctor.
40954,L267970,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
40955,L267969,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You learned this in some college course?
40956,L267968,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge."
40957,L267967,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Go on.
40958,L267966,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there."
40959,L267965,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
40960,L267964,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth."
40961,L267963,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Tell me about its sexual roots.
40962,L267962,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
40963,L267961,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Such as?...
40964,L267960,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you."
40965,L267959,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Fish can't feel.
40966,L267958,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
40967,L267957,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It couldn't!
40968,L267956,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel."
40969,L267955,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
40970,L267954,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
40971,L267953,u1240,m82,HAROLD,That's what you're supposed to say.
40972,L267952,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me."
40973,L267951,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What then?
40974,L267950,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,No.
40975,L267949,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Let me guess--breakfast is served?
40976,L267933,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
40977,L267932,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
40978,L267931,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
40979,L267924,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
40980,L267923,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,They don't have to feel like slaves.
40981,L267922,u1240,m82,HAROLD,People now have dignity when frying eggs?
40982,L267921,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
40983,L267920,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!"
40984,L267919,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,People don't use that word any more.
40985,L267918,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now."
40986,L267916,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"You're a woman, aren't you?"
40987,L267915,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
40988,L267914,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!"
40989,L267911,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
40990,L267910,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You're wrong.
40991,L267909,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
40992,L267908,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What a honeymoon.
40993,L267907,u1240,m82,HAROLD,She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
40994,L267906,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"""Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."""
40995,L267905,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Which one?
40996,L267904,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
40997,L267903,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow."
40998,L267902,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
40999,L267901,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
41000,L267900,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?"
41001,L267899,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Breakfast?
41002,L267864,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Ram it up your ass!
41003,L267863,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I have some change!
41004,L267858,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl."
41005,L267857,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I have a brain.
41006,L267856,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
41007,L267855,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
41008,L267854,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense."
41009,L267853,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around."
41010,L267852,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Turn around?
41011,L267851,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Now--turn around, if you would."
41012,L267849,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
41013,L267848,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
41014,L267847,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You used to like it stark!
41015,L267846,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,It's so--so stark.
41016,L267845,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
41017,L267840,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
41018,L267839,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He hasn't had breakfast yet.
41019,L267836,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
41020,L267835,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"A trip, you mean?"
41021,L267834,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
41022,L267833,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I did?
41023,L267832,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
41024,L267831,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary."
41025,L267830,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Now that's what I call fun.
41026,L267823,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Do say hello to your mother.
41027,L267822,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Say hello to your mother.
41028,L267821,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
41029,L267818,u1240,m82,HAROLD,He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
41030,L267817,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
41031,L267813,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--"
41032,L267812,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Please--
41033,L267811,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I could carve a better man out of a banana!
41034,L267810,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Harold!
41035,L267802,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Have some.
41036,L267801,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared."
41037,L267785,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Thank God!
41038,L267784,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Nothing would please me more.
41039,L267783,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends."
41040,L267779,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I was, I was.  It never lasts long."
41041,L267778,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Paul said you were awfully sick.
41042,L267777,u1240,m82,HAROLD,When I'm dead--  or fucking.
41043,L267776,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Shouldn't you lie down?
41044,L267775,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We all are.
41045,L267774,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"He's a very decent man, Harold."
41046,L267773,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
41047,L267772,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,We thought it was an emergency.
41048,L267771,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Your old beau?
41049,L267770,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,We thought a doctor might help.
41050,L267769,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What's that all about?
41051,L267761,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
41052,L267760,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Bluh.
41053,L267703,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
41054,L267702,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
41055,L267701,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock."
41056,L267700,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed."
41057,L267699,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
41058,L267698,u1240,m82,HAROLD,This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
41059,L267697,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Situation.
41060,L267696,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Disease?
41061,L267695,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
41062,L267694,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
41063,L267693,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can."
41064,L267692,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You were well adjusted to my being dead?
41065,L267691,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive."
41066,L267690,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Like hugging a lamp post.
41067,L267689,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Give us time.
41068,L267688,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What's the matter?
41069,L267674,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
41070,L267673,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Not at all.
41071,L267672,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?"
41072,L267671,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,How do you do?
41073,L267533,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
41074,L267532,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Some kind of animal?
41075,L267531,u1240,m82,HAROLD,My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
41076,L267530,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What do you do for a living?
41077,L267529,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
41078,L267528,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,This is crazy.
41079,L267527,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You are woman.  I know woman well.
41080,L267526,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You don't even know me.
41081,L267525,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Daughter--I love you very much.
41082,L267524,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm engaged.
41083,L267523,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
41084,L267522,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man."
41085,L267521,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"What time do you get off work, my child?"
41086,L267520,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?"
41087,L267519,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?"
41088,L267518,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Sir?
41089,L267517,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle."
41090,L267516,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Eighteen--  and a half.
41091,L267515,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I think so, daughter.  How old are you?"
41092,L267514,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Can I help you, sir?"
41093,L267513,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Heaven.
41094,L267512,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"""Hamburger Heaven."""
41095,L267169,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport."
41096,L267168,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
41097,L268396,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word."
41098,L268395,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
41099,L268394,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs."
41100,L268393,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Leave the rifle here.
41101,L268392,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Use the sanitary facilities, if I may."
41102,L268391,u1248,m82,WOODLY,What are you going to do?
41103,L268390,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means."
41104,L268389,u1248,m82,WOODLY,New lives begin!
41105,L268388,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"It's trash now, like mine."
41106,L268387,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Thank you--for my life.
41107,L268386,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
41108,L268385,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Can't do it.
41109,L268384,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
41110,L268383,u1248,m82,WOODLY,No.
41111,L268382,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Get up.
41112,L268381,u1248,m82,WOODLY,No.  No.
41113,L268380,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I've enjoyed being man.
41114,L268379,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Don't shoot.
41115,L268378,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time."
41116,L268377,u1248,m82,WOODLY,What is this thing that kills me?
41117,L268376,u1240,m82,HAROLD,If you want to be found that way.
41118,L268375,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
41119,L268374,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there."
41120,L268373,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Like the saber-toothed tiger.
41121,L268372,u1248,m82,WOODLY,New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
41122,L268371,u1240,m82,HAROLD,My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
41123,L268370,u1248,m82,WOODLY,No!
41124,L268369,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'm going to shoot you now.
41125,L268368,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
41126,L268367,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We never quit fighting until we're dead.
41127,L268366,u1248,m82,WOODLY,More clowning!  Don't you see?
41128,L268365,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
41129,L268364,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I'm utterly satisfied.
41130,L268363,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Here.  Finish the job.
41131,L268362,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind."
41132,L268361,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Was I ever of use?
41133,L268360,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns."
41134,L268359,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're too modest.
41135,L268358,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--"
41136,L268357,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The new hero is you.
41137,L268356,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed."
41138,L268355,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
41139,L268354,u1248,m82,WOODLY,My violin is avenged!
41140,L268353,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Don Quixote.
41141,L268352,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
41142,L268351,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I see.
41143,L268350,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife."
41144,L268349,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?"
41145,L268348,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
41146,L268347,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, ""Is Harold Ryan really a clown?"" And the answer is, ""Yes."""
41147,L268346,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Poison.
41148,L268345,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, ""Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete,"" and, ""Clown, clown, clown."""
41149,L268344,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
41150,L268343,u1240,m82,HAROLD,With spittle?
41151,L268342,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I've struck my blow.
41152,L268341,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Cut me open.  Find out.
41153,L268340,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
41154,L268339,u1240,m82,HAROLD,No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
41155,L268338,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"In any event, I will not beg for mercy."
41156,L268337,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You hope.
41157,L268336,u1248,m82,WOODLY,King Arthur.
41158,L268335,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'm an honorable clown?
41159,L268334,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
41160,L268333,u1240,m82,HAROLD,This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
41161,L268332,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else."
41162,L268331,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
41163,L268330,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
41164,L268329,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I love you!  Have a cigar!
41165,L268328,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
41166,L268327,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
41167,L268326,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I'm high as a kite.
41168,L268325,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
41169,L268320,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"And terror, if you don't mind."
41170,L268319,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Hands and knees, you say?"
41171,L268311,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Comical?
41172,L268310,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are."
41173,L268289,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
41174,L268288,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You're a son of a bitch.
41175,L268287,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon."
41176,L268286,u1248,m82,WOODLY,A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
41177,L268285,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Now who's being cruel?
41178,L268284,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You're old--so old.
41179,L268283,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Oooooo.  That hurt.
41180,L268282,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"You're a filthy, rotten bastard."
41181,L268279,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"We'll find out now, won't we?"
41182,L268278,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
41183,L268277,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You haven't heard me yet.
41184,L268276,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me."
41185,L268275,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Correct.
41186,L268274,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
41187,L268273,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Yes.
41188,L268272,u1240,m82,HAROLD,There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
41189,L268269,u1240,m82,HAROLD,He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
41190,L268268,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. ""Honor, "" if you like."
41191,L268267,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What brought you back?
41192,L268266,u1248,m82,WOODLY,It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
41193,L268265,u1240,m82,HAROLD,This is man to man.
41194,L268261,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Lest we forget how cruel you are.
41195,L268260,u1240,m82,HAROLD,There's a certain amount of information there.
41196,L268259,u1248,m82,WOODLY,This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
41197,L268258,u1240,m82,HAROLD,It died for your sins.
41198,L267829,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye."
41199,L267828,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What for?
41200,L267827,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
41201,L267820,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"You were wrong, you quack!"
41202,L267819,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I thought she was a widow.
41203,L267815,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: ""We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."""
41204,L267814,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Good Lord.
41205,L267809,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear."
41206,L267808,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally."
41207,L267807,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"We have, have we?"
41208,L267806,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things."
41209,L267805,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Wasn't that sweet of me?
41210,L267800,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Hundreds.
41211,L267799,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Are you've seen it work cures?
41212,L267798,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it."
41213,L267797,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I've never heard of it.
41214,L267796,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means ""cougar fang."" Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back."
41215,L267795,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Would you say that again?
41216,L267794,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Pacqualinincheewa root.
41217,L267793,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I was going to ask.
41218,L267792,u1240,m82,HAROLD,You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
41219,L267791,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: ""the Woodly galloping crud."""
41220,L267790,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You have chills?
41221,L267789,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
41222,L267788,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You've been bitten by bats?
41223,L267787,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
41224,L267786,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?"
41225,L267782,u1240,m82,HAROLD,What a brilliant diagnosis!
41226,L267781,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Ah!  You're ambulatory!
41227,L267729,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Good night.
41228,L267728,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night."
41229,L267727,u1248,m82,WOODLY,None.
41230,L267726,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--"
41231,L267725,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I feel the same way.  What next?
41232,L267714,u1240,m82,HAROLD,She's crying because she's so happy.
41233,L267713,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Are--are you crying, Penelope?"
41234,L267712,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
41235,L267711,u1248,m82,WOODLY,A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
41236,L267710,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope."
41237,L267706,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I came back.
41238,L267705,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back."
41239,L267433,u1240,m82,HAROLD,I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
41240,L267432,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I've literally got to run!
41241,L267431,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes."
41242,L267430,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I've got to run!
41243,L267429,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
41244,L267428,u1248,m82,WOODLY,And her fianc!
41245,L267427,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
41246,L267426,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
41247,L267425,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?"
41248,L267424,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
41249,L267423,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?"
41250,L267422,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
41251,L267421,u1240,m82,HAROLD,She still has just the one child-- the boy?
41252,L267420,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Will you please go?  An emergency!
41253,L267419,u1240,m82,HAROLD,And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
41254,L267418,u1248,m82,WOODLY,She's fine.  Please--
41255,L267417,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Ahh--then she's still alive.
41256,L267416,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
41257,L267415,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
41258,L267414,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here."
41259,L267413,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while."
41260,L267412,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We'll miss you so.
41261,L267411,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
41262,L267410,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
41263,L267409,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Oh dear.
41264,L267408,u1248,m82,WOODLY,...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
41265,L267407,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"Hello, Mother."
41266,L267406,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother."
41267,L267404,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
41268,L267403,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"He's dead, you know."
41269,L267402,u1240,m82,HAROLD,We tried to be.  We tried to be.
41270,L267401,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
41271,L267400,u1240,m82,HAROLD,"But here you are inside, aren't you?"
41272,L267399,u1248,m82,WOODLY,It's always locked.
41273,L267398,u1240,m82,HAROLD,The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
41274,L267393,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You startled me.
41275,L267392,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Gentlemen--that's nice.
41276,L267391,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
41277,L267390,u1240,m82,HAROLD,Ooops.
41278,L267389,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Ooops.
41279,L268153,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys."
41280,L268152,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"What will you do, Colonel?"
41281,L268151,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"So long, you guys."
41282,L268126,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I dunno.
41283,L268125,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know."
41284,L267895,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?"
41285,L267894,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,How horrible.
41286,L267893,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, ""Guess who?"" She conked right out."
41287,L267892,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What happened?
41288,L267891,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--"
41289,L267890,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Who's dead?
41290,L267889,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"For saying ""shit."" Or is that okay now?"
41291,L267888,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,For what?
41292,L267887,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope."
41293,L267886,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Alice is dead?
41294,L267885,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Jesus.
41295,L267884,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Dead!
41296,L267881,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"So that's it! ""Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum."" Everybody was yelling ""Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum."" I thought it was some foreign language."
41297,L267880,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
41298,L267879,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,There was so much going on.
41299,L267878,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You didn't even find that out?
41300,L267877,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,She did?
41301,L267876,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Alice got married again.
41302,L267873,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
41303,L267872,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"And you went home unannounced, too?"
41304,L267177,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
41305,L267176,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,It was a bitch.
41306,L267175,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You don't know?
41307,L267174,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,"I dunno, boy."
41308,L267173,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash."
41309,L267172,u1241,m82,LOOSELEAF,Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
41310,L268009,u1242,m82,MILDRED,Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
41311,L268008,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,Won't you please join our club? Please?
41312,L268007,u1242,m82,MILDRED,"That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids."
41313,L268006,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,I'm only ten years old.
41314,L268005,u1242,m82,MILDRED,"Thought you were another wife, maybe."
41315,L268004,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
41316,L268016,u1242,m82,MILDRED,Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
41317,L268015,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,Ja?
41318,L268014,u1242,m82,MILDRED,Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
41319,L268013,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,That is sad.
41320,L268012,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,"Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word ""buffalo."" Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids."
41321,L268011,u1242,m82,MILDRED,Premature ejaculation.
41322,L268010,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,Because he was cruel?
41323,L268003,u1242,m82,MILDRED,Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
41324,L268002,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
41325,L268001,u1242,m82,MILDRED,Yes.
41326,L268000,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
41327,L267999,u1242,m82,MILDRED,I heard you were looking for me.
41328,L267998,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,"Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?"
41329,L267661,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope."
41330,L267660,u1243,m82,PAUL,No.
41331,L267659,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
41332,L267658,u1243,m82,PAUL,Don't touch me.
41333,L267645,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
41334,L267644,u1243,m82,PAUL,I'll kill myself.
41335,L267643,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
41336,L267642,u1243,m82,PAUL,I don't want to live any more.
41337,L267641,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,That goes double for me.
41338,L267632,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,What a relief!
41339,L267631,u1243,m82,PAUL,Thank God!
41340,L267317,u1243,m82,PAUL,"Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too."
41341,L267316,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
41342,L267313,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?"
41343,L267312,u1243,m82,PAUL,Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
41344,L267311,u1243,m82,PAUL,Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
41345,L267310,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
41346,L267309,u1243,m82,PAUL,Don't!
41347,L267308,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,What's this?
41348,L267307,u1243,m82,PAUL,And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
41349,L267306,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Kid--kid--
41350,L267305,u1243,m82,PAUL,She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
41351,L267304,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
41352,L267303,u1243,m82,PAUL,It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
41353,L267302,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
41354,L267301,u1243,m82,PAUL,Don't worry about it.
41355,L267300,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Something's made you sore.
41356,L267299,u1243,m82,PAUL,I don't care what she wears.
41357,L267298,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
41358,L267766,u1243,m82,PAUL,Okay.
41359,L267765,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Then get him.
41360,L267764,u1243,m82,PAUL,Yeah.
41361,L267763,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"It is an emergency, isn't it?"
41362,L267762,u1243,m82,PAUL,Really?
41363,L267759,u1243,m82,PAUL,He can hardly talk.
41364,L267758,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What does he say to do?
41365,L267757,u1243,m82,PAUL,Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
41366,L267756,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What are his symptoms?
41367,L267716,u1243,m82,PAUL,Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
41368,L267715,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,That's why I'm crying.
41369,L267681,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"It is you, isn't it, Harold?"
41370,L267680,u1243,m82,PAUL,I don't get it.
41371,L267679,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
41372,L267678,u1243,m82,PAUL,What?
41373,L267677,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,That man is your father.
41374,L267676,u1243,m82,PAUL,Mom?
41375,L267670,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,For Heaven's sakes!
41376,L267669,u1243,m82,PAUL,Don't know.
41377,L267668,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What's his name?
41378,L267667,u1243,m82,PAUL,Father's friend.
41379,L267666,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Then who flushed the toilet?
41380,L267665,u1243,m82,PAUL,No.
41381,L267664,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Is Norbert still here?
41382,L267640,u1243,m82,PAUL,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
41383,L267639,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Yes, he is."
41384,L267638,u1243,m82,PAUL,What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
41385,L267637,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Who have you been talking to?
41386,L267636,u1243,m82,PAUL,Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
41387,L267315,u1243,m82,PAUL,Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
41388,L267314,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Where will you be?
41389,L267211,u1243,m82,PAUL,It's beautiful.
41390,L267210,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I hate that thing.
41391,L267209,u1243,m82,PAUL,"To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody."
41392,L267208,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I don't really know.
41393,L267207,u1243,m82,PAUL,J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
41394,L267206,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,A lot of people don't.
41395,L267205,u1243,m82,PAUL,I didn't know that.
41396,L267204,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother."
41397,L267203,u1243,m82,PAUL,I was afraid to ask.
41398,L267202,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,In a railroad accident many years ago.
41399,L267201,u1243,m82,PAUL,How did she lose her feet?
41400,L267200,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?"
41401,L267199,u1243,m82,PAUL,Still lives with his mother.
41402,L267198,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Not true.
41403,L267197,u1243,m82,PAUL,You're the only woman he ever took out.
41404,L267196,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,That's an interesting piece of news.
41405,L267195,u1243,m82,PAUL,A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
41406,L267194,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,A what kind of doctor?
41407,L267193,u1243,m82,PAUL,A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
41408,L267192,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Thank you, kind sir."
41409,L267191,u1243,m82,PAUL,If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
41410,L267190,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
41411,L267189,u1243,m82,PAUL,He's alive!
41412,L267188,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He's a ghost!
41413,L267187,u1243,m82,PAUL,You're married!  You've already got a husband!
41414,L267186,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Oh, Paul--"
41415,L267185,u1243,m82,PAUL,Stay home tonight!
41416,L267184,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I know.
41417,L267183,u1243,m82,PAUL,Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
41418,L267182,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I told you this was a simple-minded play.
41419,L267181,u1243,m82,PAUL,"He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived."
41420,L267180,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared."
41421,L267721,u1248,m82,WOODLY,No!
41422,L267720,u1243,m82,PAUL,He is my father.
41423,L267719,u1248,m82,WOODLY,He isn't?
41424,L267718,u1243,m82,PAUL,He isn't any friend of Father.
41425,L267717,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
41426,L267285,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
41427,L267284,u1243,m82,PAUL,It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
41428,L267237,u1243,m82,PAUL,Keeps fairies away!
41429,L267236,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I hate that thing.
41430,L267233,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety."
41431,L267232,u1243,m82,PAUL,It's fine!
41432,L267231,u1248,m82,WOODLY,How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
41433,L267230,u1243,m82,PAUL,Don't worry about it.
41434,L267229,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?"
41435,L267228,u1243,m82,PAUL,My father!
41436,L267227,u1248,m82,WOODLY,A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
41437,L267226,u1243,m82,PAUL,Everything stays as it is!
41438,L267221,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Oh?
41439,L267220,u1243,m82,PAUL,We don't have a maid any more.
41440,L267214,u1248,m82,WOODLY,You're going out?
41441,L267213,u1243,m82,PAUL,You're taking Mom out tonight?
41442,L267212,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope."
41443,L268120,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him."
41444,L268119,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You and Harold are friends?
41445,L267663,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
41446,L267662,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,It's true.
41447,L267657,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
41448,L267656,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You were wonderful.
41449,L267655,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful."
41450,L267654,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm saying no--and thank you.
41451,L267653,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You're saying no.
41452,L267652,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League."
41453,L267651,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Marry me instead.
41454,L267650,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm sorry.
41455,L267649,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
41456,L267648,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
41457,L267647,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,How long has this been going on?
41458,L267646,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Possibly.
41459,L267635,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?"
41460,L267634,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What's the matter now?
41461,L267388,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
41462,L267387,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What was it?
41463,L267386,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
41464,L267385,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?"
41465,L267384,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
41466,L267383,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Did you talk to Paul?
41467,L267380,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, ""Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."""
41468,L267379,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,How nice.
41469,L267378,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake."
41470,L267377,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,A what?
41471,L267376,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake."
41472,L267375,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You figure!
41473,L267374,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
41474,L267373,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
41475,L267372,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,The park!
41476,L267371,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park."
41477,L267370,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Is he coming home?
41478,L267369,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Far as I know.
41479,L267368,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Is he all right?
41480,L267367,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Yeah.
41481,L267366,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Did you see him?
41482,L267328,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
41483,L267327,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What then?
41484,L267294,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?"
41485,L267293,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
41486,L267292,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
41487,L267277,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Women are always late.  You'll find out.
41488,L267276,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Coming.
41489,L267267,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Good night.
41490,L267266,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night."
41491,L267265,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I see.
41492,L267264,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,That's when I'll get my confidence back.
41493,L267263,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm touched.
41494,L267262,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife."
41495,L267261,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead."
41496,L267260,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Something happens to my confidence.
41497,L267259,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Yes?
41498,L267258,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, ""My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"""
41499,L267257,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
41500,L267256,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt."
41501,L267255,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I know.
41502,L267254,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
41503,L267253,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm glad.
41504,L267252,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up."
41505,L267251,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,That's something I suppose.
41506,L267250,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,He'd assume we had.
41507,L267249,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know."
41508,L267248,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is."
41509,L267247,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Doing what?
41510,L267246,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
41511,L267244,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?"
41512,L267243,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
41513,L267242,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Please--
41514,L268322,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Goodbye.
41515,L268321,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Do it!
41516,L268307,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!"
41517,L268306,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Everything's going to be beautiful.
41518,L268257,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?"
41519,L268256,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"You fool, you fool."
41520,L268255,u1248,m82,WOODLY,It's really that bad?
41521,L268254,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Get out of here.
41522,L267826,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Thanks.
41523,L267825,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Tell her to have a nice trip.
41524,L267824,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
41525,L267804,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I believe in miracles now.
41526,L267803,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Thank you.  Thank you very much.
41527,L267709,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,How neat.  How keen.
41528,L267708,u1248,m82,WOODLY,We met here earlier this evening.
41529,L267707,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,You know each other?
41530,L267364,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged."
41531,L267363,u1248,m82,WOODLY,That's been said before.
41532,L267362,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,It's a jungle out there.
41533,L267361,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, ""You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight.""  On that we can build."
41534,L267360,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,He's not your son.
41535,L267359,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that."
41536,L267358,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,We've got to rescue him.
41537,L267357,u1248,m82,WOODLY,He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
41538,L267356,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Paul's only twelve years old.
41539,L267355,u1248,m82,WOODLY,They didn't murder me.
41540,L267354,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
41541,L267353,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me."
41542,L267352,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,I'm amazed.
41543,L267351,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--"
41544,L267350,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Why would you do that?
41545,L267349,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight."
41546,L267348,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Meaning?
41547,L267347,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
41548,L267346,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,It's suicide!
41549,L267345,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I wish Paul luck.
41550,L267344,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
41551,L267343,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty."
41552,L267342,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!"
41553,L267341,u1248,m82,WOODLY,What kind of a life is that?
41554,L267340,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition."
41555,L267339,u1248,m82,WOODLY,The what?
41556,L267338,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,That's the XKE.
41557,L267337,u1248,m82,WOODLY,We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
41558,L267336,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"The only thing I ever told him about life was, ""Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."""
41559,L267335,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again."
41560,L267334,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,As long as he keeps out of the park.
41561,L267333,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow."
41562,L267332,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,It is?
41563,L267331,u1248,m82,WOODLY,This is very good for us.
41564,L267323,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Tonight's the night.
41565,L267322,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say."
41566,L267297,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you."
41567,L267296,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,What?
41568,L267295,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
41569,L267235,u1248,m82,WOODLY,No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
41570,L267234,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"""War is not healthy for children and other living things."" How lovely."
41571,L267225,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
41572,L267224,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
41573,L267223,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?"
41574,L267222,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
41575,L267219,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,She quit this afternoon.
41576,L267218,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact."
41577,L267217,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,We made the date three months ago.
41578,L267216,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Take plenty of cigars.
41579,L267215,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
41580,L267171,u1244,m82,PENELOPE,"Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?"
41581,L267170,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed."
41582,L267382,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"We can take off the ""Wanda June"" with a butter knife."
41583,L267381,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"""Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"""
41584,L267330,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back."
41585,L267329,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Minors aren't allowed at fights.
41586,L267326,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
41587,L267325,u1248,m82,WOODLY,What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
41588,L267324,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--"
41589,L267321,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father."
41590,L267320,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--"
41591,L267319,u1248,m82,WOODLY,It's good.  Let him go.
41592,L267318,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Kid--kid--
41593,L267291,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!"
41594,L267290,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
41595,L267289,u1248,m82,WOODLY,He died of a massive rupture.
41596,L267288,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
41597,L267287,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
41598,L267286,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
41599,L267283,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?"
41600,L267282,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind."
41601,L267281,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
41602,L267280,u1248,m82,WOODLY,It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
41603,L267279,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,"I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!"
41604,L267278,u1248,m82,WOODLY,The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
41605,L267275,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Penelope!  We're late!
41606,L267274,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive."
41607,L267273,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
41608,L267272,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Phooey.
41609,L267271,u1248,m82,WOODLY,"That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true."
41610,L267270,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Or get eaten alive.
41611,L267269,u1248,m82,WOODLY,Not true.
41612,L267268,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,You've got to fight from time to time.
41613,L267241,u1248,m82,WOODLY,That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
41614,L267240,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Is that a fact?
41615,L267239,u1248,m82,WOODLY,I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
41616,L267238,u1245,m82,SHUTTLE,Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
41617,L267996,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,"You bet! ""The Harold Ryan Fan Club."" Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, ""Go take a flying--"
41618,L267995,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,"We're going to have jackets, aren't we?"
41619,L267994,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,"It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? ""Pontius Pilate Athletic Club."" Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club."
41620,L267993,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,"Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard."
41621,L267992,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
41622,L267991,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,"Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard."
41623,L267990,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,Mozart plays shuffleboard.
41624,L267989,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
41625,L267988,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,"We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard."
41626,L267987,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,"We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time."
41627,L267986,u1246,m82,VON KONIGSWALD,"Yes, we do."
41628,L267985,u1247,m82,WANDA JUNE,We have this new club up here in Heaven.
41629,L269561,u1249,m83,BEATRICE,"You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?"
41630,L269560,u1255,m83,JAKE,No. I don't think so.
41631,L269550,u1249,m83,BEATRICE,That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
41632,L269549,u1255,m83,JAKE,I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
41633,L269548,u1249,m83,BEATRICE,"What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express."
41634,L269547,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41635,L269546,u1249,m83,BEATRICE,Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
41636,L269686,u1250,m83,BLACK STUD,"Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come."
41637,L269685,u1255,m83,JAKE,"I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call."
41638,L269684,u1250,m83,BLACK STUD,"What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long."
41639,L269683,u1255,m83,JAKE,"No, just not the type."
41640,L269682,u1250,m83,BLACK STUD,You mean I'm black?
41641,L269681,u1255,m83,JAKE,You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
41642,L269402,u1251,m83,BURROWS,"Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead."
41643,L269401,u1255,m83,JAKE,What are you doing?
41644,L269400,u1251,m83,BURROWS,"I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities."
41645,L269399,u1255,m83,JAKE,There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
41646,L269398,u1251,m83,BURROWS,There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
41647,L269397,u1255,m83,JAKE,"But is she, has..."
41648,L269396,u1251,m83,BURROWS,The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
41649,L269855,u1251,m83,BURROWS,"Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you."
41650,L269854,u1261,m83,MAST,Big threat. TV would ream you.
41651,L269853,u1251,m83,BURROWS,We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
41652,L269852,u1261,m83,MAST,"If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star."
41653,L269851,u1251,m83,BURROWS,I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
41654,L269850,u1261,m83,MAST,"You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you..."
41655,L269849,u1251,m83,BURROWS,Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
41656,L269605,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
41657,L269604,u1252,m83,FELICE,Wait?
41658,L269603,u1255,m83,JAKE,Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
41659,L269602,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
41660,L269601,u1252,m83,FELICE,"Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks."
41661,L269600,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'm getting angry.
41662,L269599,u1252,m83,FELICE,"Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before."
41663,L269598,u1255,m83,JAKE,...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
41664,L269597,u1252,m83,FELICE,That's cool.
41665,L269596,u1255,m83,JAKE,I said I just wanted to talk to you...
41666,L269595,u1252,m83,FELICE,"Now, what do you want?"
41667,L269594,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
41668,L269593,u1252,m83,FELICE,"What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it."
41669,L269592,u1255,m83,JAKE,What do you mean?
41670,L269591,u1252,m83,FELICE,Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
41671,L269590,u1255,m83,JAKE,You want a tip?
41672,L269589,u1252,m83,FELICE,"Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips."
41673,L269588,u1255,m83,JAKE,What do you mean?
41674,L269587,u1252,m83,FELICE,Are you going to stiff me?
41675,L269586,u1255,m83,JAKE,"No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me."
41676,L269585,u1252,m83,FELICE,Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
41677,L269584,u1255,m83,JAKE,What?
41678,L269583,u1252,m83,FELICE,Pull out your cock.
41679,L269582,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here."
41680,L269581,u1252,m83,FELICE,"I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off."
41681,L269580,u1255,m83,JAKE,"No, I don't."
41682,L269579,u1252,m83,FELICE,"You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?"
41683,L269578,u1255,m83,JAKE,There's a girl I want to ask you about.
41684,L269577,u1252,m83,FELICE,Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
41685,L269576,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Well, I want to..."
41686,L269575,u1252,m83,FELICE,You're still dressed?
41687,L269573,u1255,m83,JAKE,You'll be fine.
41688,L269572,u1252,m83,FELICE,Do you have any particular choice of girl?
41689,L269571,u1255,m83,JAKE,Okay. I'll take a half hour.
41690,L269570,u1252,m83,FELICE,You may do that in the privacy of your room.
41691,L269569,u1255,m83,JAKE,I just want to ask some questions.
41692,L269568,u1252,m83,FELICE,Do you want to take a session?
41693,L269567,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah.
41694,L269566,u1252,m83,FELICE,"We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express."
41695,L269565,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41696,L269648,u1253,m83,GIRL AT THE WINDOW,"'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671."
41697,L269647,u1255,m83,JAKE,Okay.
41698,L269646,u1253,m83,GIRL AT THE WINDOW,"'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face."
41699,L269644,u1253,m83,GIRL AT THE WINDOW,"The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face."
41700,L269643,u1255,m83,JAKE,Just one.
41701,L269642,u1253,m83,GIRL AT THE WINDOW,How many weeks?
41702,L269641,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
41703,L270001,u1254,m83,HOPE,That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
41704,L270000,u1255,m83,JAKE,I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
41705,L269999,u1254,m83,HOPE,"Man, how many girls do you need?"
41706,L269998,u1255,m83,JAKE,"That's all you got, three girls?"
41707,L269997,u1254,m83,HOPE,My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
41708,L269996,u1255,m83,JAKE,What girls you got here?
41709,L269995,u1254,m83,HOPE,I don't know no Tod.
41710,L269994,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
41711,L269993,u1254,m83,HOPE,"...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation."
41712,L269992,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Yeah, yeah..."
41713,L269991,u1254,m83,HOPE,We offer...
41714,L269990,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah.
41715,L269989,u1254,m83,HOPE,Hello. You want some information?
41716,L269356,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah. How did you know?
41717,L269355,u1260,m83,MARY,"Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?"
41718,L269354,u1255,m83,JAKE,If you say so.
41719,L269353,u1260,m83,MARY,Yes. I think it'll look better.
41720,L269352,u1255,m83,JAKE,Are you sure it's all right?
41721,L269351,u1260,m83,MARY,"Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit."
41722,L269350,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah.
41723,L269349,u1260,m83,MARY,Overpowering?
41724,L269348,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
41725,L269347,u1260,m83,MARY,Sam?
41726,L269346,u1255,m83,JAKE,Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
41727,L269345,u1260,m83,MARY,Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
41728,L269344,u1255,m83,JAKE,What's that shade of blue called?
41729,L269343,u1260,m83,MARY,"Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right."
41730,L269342,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for."
41731,L269341,u1260,m83,MARY,"No, that would be much too overpowering."
41732,L269340,u1255,m83,JAKE,"No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall."
41733,L269339,u1260,m83,MARY,Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
41734,L269338,u1255,m83,JAKE,Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
41735,L269337,u1260,m83,MARY,"I like it, Mr. Van Dorn."
41736,L269336,u1255,m83,JAKE,"What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary."
41737,L269335,u1260,m83,MARY,"I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area."
41738,L269334,u1255,m83,JAKE,Is this all the display space we can get?
41739,L269980,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Where is he, Niki?"
41740,L269979,u1262,m83,NIKI,But then you'll forget about me.
41741,L269978,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is."
41742,L269977,u1262,m83,NIKI,I can't tell you that.
41743,L269976,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where is he?
41744,L269975,u1262,m83,NIKI,What happened?
41745,L269974,u1255,m83,JAKE,Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
41746,L269973,u1262,m83,NIKI,Did you find out where she was?
41747,L269914,u1262,m83,NIKI,"So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit."
41748,L269913,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about..."
41749,L269912,u1262,m83,NIKI,"My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money..."
41750,L269911,u1255,m83,JAKE,Granville?
41751,L269910,u1262,m83,NIKI,Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
41752,L269909,u1255,m83,JAKE,"I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes..."
41753,L269908,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex."
41754,L269907,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
41755,L269906,u1262,m83,NIKI,She left you right?
41756,L269905,u1262,m83,NIKI,Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
41757,L269904,u1255,m83,JAKE,Why do you say that?
41758,L269903,u1262,m83,NIKI,You wife isn't dead is she?
41759,L269902,u1255,m83,JAKE,What makes you so sure?
41760,L269901,u1262,m83,NIKI,I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
41761,L269900,u1255,m83,JAKE,But what?
41762,L269899,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Look, I really don't know your daughter but..."
41763,L269897,u1262,m83,NIKI,On your own land?
41764,L269896,u1255,m83,JAKE,Grand Rapids? Of course.
41765,L269895,u1262,m83,NIKI,Do you live in a house back in wherever.
41766,L269894,u1255,m83,JAKE,They are the same.
41767,L269893,u1262,m83,NIKI,I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
41768,L269892,u1255,m83,JAKE,I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
41769,L269891,u1262,m83,NIKI,Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
41770,L269890,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where does he live.
41771,L269889,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now."
41772,L269886,u1255,m83,JAKE,Why can't I meet him now?
41773,L269885,u1262,m83,NIKI,Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
41774,L269884,u1262,m83,NIKI,It doesn't make any sense to me.
41775,L269883,u1255,m83,JAKE,It's not quite the same thing.
41776,L269882,u1262,m83,NIKI,If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
41777,L269881,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
41778,L269880,u1262,m83,NIKI,I thought I was fucked up.
41779,L269879,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Yeah.  Well, mostly."
41780,L269878,u1262,m83,NIKI,You really believe all that?
41781,L269877,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will."
41782,L269876,u1262,m83,NIKI,Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
41783,L269875,u1255,m83,JAKE,More or less.
41784,L269874,u1262,m83,NIKI,So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
41785,L269873,u1255,m83,JAKE,"He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved."
41786,L269872,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?"
41787,L269871,u1255,m83,JAKE,I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
41788,L269870,u1262,m83,NIKI,"No, please go on."
41789,L269869,u1255,m83,JAKE,I can stop if you want.
41790,L269868,u1262,m83,NIKI,Fuck.
41791,L269867,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven."
41792,L269866,u1262,m83,NIKI,Shit.
41793,L269865,u1255,m83,JAKE,"T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'"
41794,L269864,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Yeah, yeah, go on."
41795,L269863,u1255,m83,JAKE,It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
41796,L269862,u1262,m83,NIKI,What the crap?
41797,L269861,u1255,m83,JAKE,They believe in the 'TULIP.'
41798,L269860,u1262,m83,NIKI,Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
41799,L269859,u1255,m83,JAKE,Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
41800,L269858,u1262,m83,NIKI,You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
41801,L269847,u1255,m83,JAKE,Is Kristen safe?
41802,L269846,u1262,m83,NIKI,He deals in pain.
41803,L269845,u1255,m83,JAKE,What does that mean?  What does he do?
41804,L269844,u1262,m83,NIKI,Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
41805,L269843,u1255,m83,JAKE,They were here?
41806,L269842,u1262,m83,NIKI,Tijuana.
41807,L269841,u1255,m83,JAKE,What's T-J?
41808,L269832,u1255,m83,JAKE,I care about my daughter.
41809,L269831,u1262,m83,NIKI,What do you care about?
41810,L269830,u1255,m83,JAKE,I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
41811,L269828,u1262,m83,NIKI,We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
41812,L269827,u1255,m83,JAKE,Not very.
41813,L269826,u1262,m83,NIKI,How important do you think sex is?
41814,L269825,u1255,m83,JAKE,But it's all you do.
41815,L269824,u1262,m83,NIKI,Neither am I.
41816,L269823,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41817,L269822,u1262,m83,NIKI,Why? Are you a sex fiend?
41818,L269821,u1255,m83,JAKE,"You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex."
41819,L269820,u1262,m83,NIKI,No.
41820,L269819,u1255,m83,JAKE,You used to work at Copper Penny?
41821,L269818,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job."
41822,L269817,u1262,m83,NIKI,No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
41823,L269816,u1255,m83,JAKE,Is that the way it was with you?
41824,L269815,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?"
41825,L269814,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?"
41826,L269813,u1262,m83,NIKI,You don't understand shit.
41827,L269812,u1255,m83,JAKE,Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
41828,L269811,u1262,m83,NIKI,'Sucking off.'
41829,L269810,u1255,m83,JAKE,Say what?
41830,L269809,u1262,m83,NIKI,"You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?"
41831,L269808,u1255,m83,JAKE,You know what I'm talking about.
41832,L269807,u1262,m83,NIKI,What rate?
41833,L269806,u1255,m83,JAKE,You won't keep growing at this rate.
41834,L269805,u1262,m83,NIKI,At least I'm a growing person.
41835,L269804,u1255,m83,JAKE,You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
41836,L269799,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days."
41837,L269798,u1255,m83,JAKE,She's dead.
41838,L269797,u1262,m83,NIKI,And your wife? Where's she?
41839,L269796,u1255,m83,JAKE,Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
41840,L269795,u1262,m83,NIKI,Jesus.
41841,L269794,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah.  I'm her father.
41842,L269793,u1262,m83,NIKI,Of Joanne's?
41843,L269792,u1255,m83,JAKE,A friend.
41844,L269791,u1262,m83,NIKI,I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
41845,L269790,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41846,L269789,u1262,m83,NIKI,"You're not a private detective either, are you?"
41847,L269788,u1255,m83,JAKE,Ulcers.
41848,L269787,u1262,m83,NIKI,You don't drink?
41849,L269786,u1255,m83,JAKE,"I don't drink, but you can go out."
41850,L269785,u1262,m83,NIKI,You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
41851,L269784,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep."
41852,L269783,u1262,m83,NIKI,Huh?
41853,L269782,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41854,L269779,u1255,m83,JAKE,I am.
41855,L269778,u1262,m83,NIKI,I thought you were going to bed?
41856,L269758,u1262,m83,NIKI,This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
41857,L269757,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?"
41858,L269756,u1262,m83,NIKI,When do we start?
41859,L269755,u1255,m83,JAKE,Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
41860,L269754,u1262,m83,NIKI,Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
41861,L269753,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Half now, half later."
41862,L269752,u1262,m83,NIKI,Up front?
41863,L269751,u1255,m83,JAKE,"I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl."
41864,L269750,u1262,m83,NIKI,This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
41865,L269749,u1255,m83,JAKE,Three hundred?
41866,L269748,u1262,m83,NIKI,Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
41867,L269747,u1255,m83,JAKE,Something like that. How much do you make?
41868,L269746,u1262,m83,NIKI,Are you a private detective?
41869,L269745,u1255,m83,JAKE,"How much do you make a week, Niki?"
41870,L269744,u1262,m83,NIKI,"You're not a film producer, are you?"
41871,L269743,u1255,m83,JAKE,"If we went there, would you be able to find him?"
41872,L269742,u1262,m83,NIKI,Last I heard he went to San Diego.
41873,L269741,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where's he?
41874,L269740,u1262,m83,NIKI,Tod might know.
41875,L269739,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where is she?
41876,L269738,u1255,m83,JAKE,Do you know where she would be?
41877,L269737,u1262,m83,NIKI,Nah.
41878,L269736,u1255,m83,JAKE,Do you know where she lives?
41879,L269735,u1262,m83,NIKI,No. I saw her with Tod.
41880,L269734,u1255,m83,JAKE,You know her?
41881,L269733,u1262,m83,NIKI,Joanne?
41882,L269731,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this."
41883,L269730,u1255,m83,JAKE,Um-hm. Live sound.
41884,L269729,u1262,m83,NIKI,You making a feature?
41885,L269728,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah.
41886,L269727,u1262,m83,NIKI,Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
41887,L269726,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
41888,L269725,u1262,m83,NIKI,It's your money. You talk.
41889,L269724,u1262,m83,NIKI,Too bad. I wasn't in it.
41890,L269723,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41891,L269722,u1262,m83,NIKI,Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
41892,L269721,u1255,m83,JAKE,Are you Niki?
41893,L269654,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more."
41894,L269653,u1255,m83,JAKE,I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
41895,L269652,u1262,m83,NIKI,She thinks so.  What do you do?
41896,L269651,u1255,m83,JAKE,The other girl is the star?
41897,L269650,u1262,m83,NIKI,You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
41898,L269649,u1255,m83,JAKE,Are you the star of this picture?
41899,L270028,u1261,m83,MAST,"Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over."
41900,L270027,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money..."
41901,L269972,u1261,m83,MAST,But I'm here to help you...
41902,L269971,u1255,m83,JAKE,Just leave me alone.
41903,L269970,u1261,m83,MAST,"What happened, pilgrim?"
41904,L269933,u1261,m83,MAST,Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
41905,L269932,u1255,m83,JAKE,Does she know anything about this?
41906,L269931,u1261,m83,MAST,Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
41907,L269930,u1255,m83,JAKE,It's just a name.
41908,L269929,u1261,m83,MAST,"You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?"
41909,L269928,u1255,m83,JAKE,I just heard. Who is he?
41910,L269927,u1261,m83,MAST,Where'd you hear that name?
41911,L269926,u1255,m83,JAKE,Who is Ratan?
41912,L269925,u1261,m83,MAST,Like what?
41913,L269924,u1255,m83,JAKE,Why don't you tell me something for a change?
41914,L269923,u1261,m83,MAST,I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
41915,L269922,u1255,m83,JAKE,You sure as hell haven't been any help.
41916,L269921,u1261,m83,MAST,"Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into."
41917,L269920,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Yeah, sure."
41918,L269919,u1261,m83,MAST,Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
41919,L269918,u1255,m83,JAKE,Do the police want to arrest me?
41920,L269917,u1261,m83,MAST,"I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face."
41921,L269916,u1255,m83,JAKE,What are you doing here?
41922,L269521,u1255,m83,JAKE,Get out!
41923,L269520,u1261,m83,MAST,But this is my apartment.
41924,L269519,u1255,m83,JAKE,Get out.
41925,L269518,u1261,m83,MAST,"I'm only human, you know."
41926,L269517,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit."
41927,L269516,u1261,m83,MAST,"Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong."
41928,L269515,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too."
41929,L269514,u1261,m83,MAST,"I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something."
41930,L269482,u1261,m83,MAST,"I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why."
41931,L269481,u1255,m83,JAKE,"You like this, don't you. Showing me... this."
41932,L269480,u1261,m83,MAST,Yeah. Probably.
41933,L269479,u1255,m83,JAKE,Do you think she's safe?
41934,L269478,u1261,m83,MAST,The police? They know less than you do.
41935,L269477,u1255,m83,JAKE,But the police...
41936,L269476,u1261,m83,MAST,"It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else."
41937,L269475,u1255,m83,JAKE,What's it called?
41938,L269474,u1261,m83,MAST,"Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist."
41939,L269473,u1255,m83,JAKE,What do you mean?
41940,L269472,u1261,m83,MAST,I don't know.
41941,L269471,u1255,m83,JAKE,Who made it?
41942,L269470,u1261,m83,MAST,I bought it at a store in L.A.
41943,L269469,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where did you get that film?
41944,L269468,u1261,m83,MAST,I don't know.
41945,L269467,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where is she?
41946,L269464,u1261,m83,MAST,"There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see."
41947,L269463,u1255,m83,JAKE,Hmm.
41948,L269462,u1261,m83,MAST,Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
41949,L269461,u1255,m83,JAKE,They are?
41950,L269460,u1261,m83,MAST,They're legal now.
41951,L269459,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41952,L269458,u1261,m83,MAST,Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
41953,L269457,u1255,m83,JAKE,That's like a stag film.
41954,L269456,u1261,m83,MAST,"Do you know what a ""hardcore"" movie is?"
41955,L269455,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
41956,L269454,u1261,m83,MAST,"Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?"
41957,L269453,u1255,m83,JAKE,What do you mean?
41958,L269452,u1261,m83,MAST,I don't know.
41959,L269451,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where is she?
41960,L269450,u1261,m83,MAST,I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
41961,L269449,u1255,m83,JAKE,What have you found out?
41962,L269448,u1261,m83,MAST,"This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all."
41963,L269447,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'll be there.
41964,L269446,u1261,m83,MAST,What are you paying me for?
41965,L269445,u1255,m83,JAKE,I've got a meeting...
41966,L269444,u1261,m83,MAST,Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
41967,L269443,u1255,m83,JAKE,In G.R.? Why?
41968,L269442,u1261,m83,MAST,I'm back in Grand Rapids.
41969,L269441,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
41970,L269440,u1261,m83,MAST,Yeah.
41971,L269439,u1255,m83,JAKE,Mast?
41972,L269438,u1261,m83,MAST,Mr. Van Dorn?
41973,L269437,u1255,m83,JAKE,Hello?
41974,L269418,u1261,m83,MAST,"I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down."
41975,L269417,u1255,m83,JAKE,And better?
41976,L269416,u1261,m83,MAST,"As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper."
41977,L269415,u1255,m83,JAKE,That's right.
41978,L269414,u1261,m83,MAST,You are.
41979,L269413,u1255,m83,JAKE,Who's paying you?
41980,L269412,u1261,m83,MAST,"Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them."
41981,L269411,u1255,m83,JAKE,"If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language."
41982,L269410,u1261,m83,MAST,"No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around..."
41983,L269409,u1261,m83,MAST,"Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?"
41984,L269408,u1255,m83,JAKE,...What do you have to offer?
41985,L269407,u1261,m83,MAST,Andy.
41986,L269406,u1255,m83,JAKE,"So then, Mr. Mast..."
41987,L269405,u1261,m83,MAST,"Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care."
41988,L269404,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Well, what do they know?"
41989,L269403,u1261,m83,MAST,"Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in."
41990,L269671,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them..."
41991,L269670,u1267,m83,WES,What will I tell the others? They care about you.
41992,L269669,u1255,m83,JAKE,"You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me."
41993,L269668,u1267,m83,WES,What plan?
41994,L269667,u1255,m83,JAKE,I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
41995,L269666,u1267,m83,WES,What is going on?
41996,L269665,u1255,m83,JAKE,Just do what I say. Don't ask.
41997,L269664,u1255,m83,JAKE,Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
41998,L269663,u1267,m83,WES,What?
41999,L269662,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Wes, do me a favor."
42000,L269661,u1267,m83,WES,"I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive."
42001,L269660,u1255,m83,JAKE,How did you find me?
42002,L269659,u1267,m83,WES,Jake?
42003,L269434,u1267,m83,WES,You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
42004,L269433,u1255,m83,JAKE,Pretty good.
42005,L269432,u1267,m83,WES,"How's your business, Jake?"
42006,L269388,u1267,m83,WES,I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
42007,L269387,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
42008,L269386,u1267,m83,WES,Is Marsha there?
42009,L269383,u1255,m83,JAKE,They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
42010,L269382,u1267,m83,WES,What happened?
42011,L269379,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Wes, Anne, come here a moment."
42012,L269378,u1267,m83,WES,"What is it, Jake?"
42013,L269328,u1267,m83,WES,Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
42014,L269327,u1255,m83,JAKE,No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
42015,L269326,u1267,m83,WES,You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
42016,L269713,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,"Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest."
42017,L269712,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where!
42018,L269711,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,I don't know.
42019,L269710,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where does he hang out?
42020,L269709,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
42021,L269708,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where is she? Where is the girl?
42022,L269707,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,"Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me."
42023,L269703,u1255,m83,JAKE,I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
42024,L269702,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,"God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing."
42025,L269701,u1255,m83,JAKE,It was called 'Slave of Love.'
42026,L269700,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
42027,L269698,u1255,m83,JAKE,That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
42028,L269697,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,"Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff."
42029,L269696,u1255,m83,JAKE,"That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for."
42030,L269695,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
42031,L269694,u1255,m83,JAKE,"That's not true, Mr...?"
42032,L269693,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
42033,L269692,u1255,m83,JAKE,We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
42034,L269691,u1256,m83,JISM JIM,Hey man.
42035,L270020,u1255,m83,JAKE,Let's go.
42036,L270019,u1266,m83,TOD,Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
42037,L270016,u1255,m83,JAKE,Ratan!
42038,L270015,u1266,m83,TOD,That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
42039,L270013,u1266,m83,TOD,Who?
42040,L270012,u1255,m83,JAKE,Where's Ratan?
42041,L270010,u1255,m83,JAKE,You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
42042,L270009,u1266,m83,TOD,You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
42043,L270005,u1266,m83,TOD,I don't know what you're talking about.
42044,L270004,u1255,m83,JAKE,"I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you."
42045,L270003,u1266,m83,TOD,What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
42046,L269954,u1255,m83,JAKE,Good.
42047,L269953,u1266,m83,TOD,Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
42048,L269952,u1255,m83,JAKE,Okay.
42049,L269951,u1266,m83,TOD,Take it or leave it.
42050,L269950,u1255,m83,JAKE,Well...
42051,L269949,u1266,m83,TOD,Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
42052,L269948,u1255,m83,JAKE,Is this with a girl named Kristen?
42053,L269947,u1266,m83,TOD,"I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening."
42054,L269946,u1255,m83,JAKE,Rucker.
42055,L269945,u1266,m83,TOD,Who told you about this?
42056,L269944,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know..."
42057,L269943,u1266,m83,TOD,You're talking about real excitement?
42058,L269942,u1255,m83,JAKE,I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
42059,L269941,u1266,m83,TOD,What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
42060,L269940,u1255,m83,JAKE,I want to meet Ratan.
42061,L269939,u1266,m83,TOD,What you got in mind?
42062,L269938,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
42063,L269937,u1266,m83,TOD,"Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?"
42064,L269936,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yeah.
42065,L269935,u1266,m83,TOD,I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
42066,L269543,u1265,m83,TELLER,"No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents."
42067,L269542,u1255,m83,JAKE,That's all right.
42068,L269541,u1265,m83,TELLER,Here. Take your fifty cents back.
42069,L269540,u1255,m83,JAKE,No.
42070,L269539,u1265,m83,TELLER,You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
42071,L269538,u1265,m83,TELLER,"I don't know nothing, man."
42072,L269537,u1255,m83,JAKE,But I...
42073,L269536,u1265,m83,TELLER,"I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops."
42074,L269535,u1255,m83,JAKE,I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
42075,L269534,u1265,m83,TELLER,"That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody."
42076,L269533,u1255,m83,JAKE,I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
42077,L269532,u1265,m83,TELLER,I don't know what you're talking about.
42078,L269531,u1255,m83,JAKE,This is from the movie I was talking about.
42079,L269529,u1265,m83,TELLER,They're all about the same. You want something?
42080,L269528,u1255,m83,JAKE,It's a short film.
42081,L269527,u1265,m83,TELLER,What we got is just these here.  What you see.
42082,L269526,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'"
42083,L269525,u1265,m83,TELLER,It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
42084,L269524,u1255,m83,JAKE,What?
42085,L269523,u1265,m83,TELLER,Fifty cents admission.
42086,L269636,u1263,m83,RAMADA,Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
42087,L269635,u1255,m83,JAKE,Sounds all right.
42088,L269634,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around."
42089,L269633,u1255,m83,JAKE,Jake.
42090,L269632,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?"
42091,L269631,u1255,m83,JAKE,I thought you were a businessman.
42092,L269630,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper."
42093,L269629,u1255,m83,JAKE,It's an investment.
42094,L269628,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?"
42095,L269627,u1255,m83,JAKE,Not exactly...
42096,L269626,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"In other words, you want to get laid?"
42097,L269625,u1255,m83,JAKE,"I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done..."
42098,L269624,u1263,m83,RAMADA,What exactly do you have in mind?
42099,L269623,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this."
42100,L269622,u1263,m83,RAMADA,Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
42101,L269621,u1255,m83,JAKE,I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
42102,L269620,u1263,m83,RAMADA,Film making can be pretty expensive...
42103,L269619,u1255,m83,JAKE,Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
42104,L269618,u1263,m83,RAMADA,My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
42105,L269617,u1255,m83,JAKE,No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
42106,L269614,u1255,m83,JAKE,What do you think of that? Or this?
42107,L269613,u1258,m83,MANAGER,"Hold it, mister."
42108,L269612,u1255,m83,JAKE,"Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?"
42109,L269611,u1258,m83,MANAGER,"Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off."
42110,L269610,u1255,m83,JAKE,"I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?"
42111,L269609,u1258,m83,MANAGER,"Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?"
42112,L269608,u1255,m83,JAKE,I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
42113,L269367,u1259,m83,MARSHA,"Well, each time he comes in closer, like this."
42114,L269366,u1257,m83,KRISTEN,What does that do?
42115,L269365,u1259,m83,MARSHA,"Well, a boy goes like this, see."
42116,L269364,u1257,m83,KRISTEN,"Com'on, tell me."
42117,L269363,u1259,m83,MARSHA,You never heard of that?
42118,L269362,u1257,m83,KRISTEN,What's that?
42119,L269361,u1259,m83,MARSHA,You ever play Chicken?
42120,L269360,u1257,m83,KRISTEN,I don't know.
42121,L269359,u1259,m83,MARSHA,He asked me. You going with anybody?
42122,L269358,u1257,m83,KRISTEN,You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
42123,L269776,u1267,m83,WES,To anybody.
42124,L269775,u1261,m83,MAST,To his own daughter?
42125,L269774,u1267,m83,WES,"You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything."
42126,L269773,u1261,m83,MAST,Huh?
42127,L269772,u1267,m83,WES,I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
42128,L269771,u1261,m83,MAST,Maybe. Maybe not.
42129,L269770,u1267,m83,WES,Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
42130,L269769,u1261,m83,MAST,"I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses."
42131,L269768,u1267,m83,WES,I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
42132,L269766,u1261,m83,MAST,"I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal."
42133,L269765,u1267,m83,WES,He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
42134,L269764,u1261,m83,MAST,I'm off that case. He fired me.
42135,L269763,u1267,m83,WES,I'm worried about Jake.
42136,L269762,u1261,m83,MAST,I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
42137,L269761,u1267,m83,WES,Oh.
42138,L269760,u1261,m83,MAST,Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
42139,L269968,u1261,m83,MAST,"Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?"
42140,L269967,u1262,m83,NIKI,Jake'll take care of me.
42141,L269966,u1261,m83,MAST,Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
42142,L269965,u1262,m83,NIKI,I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
42143,L269964,u1261,m83,MAST,You're taking a big chance.
42144,L269963,u1262,m83,NIKI,"You can fuck off, too."
42145,L269961,u1262,m83,NIKI,"Well, he can just fuck himself."
42146,L269960,u1261,m83,MAST,The guy who bought you that ring.
42147,L269959,u1262,m83,NIKI,Who's that?
42148,L269958,u1261,m83,MAST,Granville's looking for you anyway.
42149,L269957,u1262,m83,NIKI,"My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica."
42150,L269956,u1261,m83,MAST,"You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?"
42151,L269505,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?"
42152,L269504,u1261,m83,MAST,"Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble."
42153,L269503,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"No, Andy. Don't know the kid."
42154,L269502,u1261,m83,MAST,I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
42155,L269501,u1263,m83,RAMADA,At least I improved myself. What's up?
42156,L269500,u1261,m83,MAST,"You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too."
42157,L269499,u1263,m83,RAMADA,"Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?"
42158,L269839,u1262,m83,NIKI,Thanks.
42159,L269838,u1264,m83,RUCKER,No.
42160,L269837,u1262,m83,NIKI,Was he with a girl?
42161,L269836,u1264,m83,RUCKER,"'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now."
42162,L269835,u1262,m83,NIKI,"I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around."
42163,L269834,u1264,m83,RUCKER,You working in San Diego now?
42164,L269833,u1262,m83,NIKI,You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
42165,L270210,u1268,m84,CANDY,"Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite."
42166,L270209,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments."
42167,L270207,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?"
42168,L270206,u1268,m84,CANDY,"He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec."
42169,L270204,u1268,m84,CANDY,Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
42170,L270203,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Eh, Poli Sci?"
42171,L270202,u1268,m84,CANDY,Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
42172,L270201,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,And what are you studying?
42173,L270200,u1268,m84,CANDY,"Yes, I am."
42174,L270199,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"You are at the University, Candy?"
42175,L270197,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
42176,L270196,u1268,m84,CANDY,"Hello, I'm Candy Gulf."
42177,L270410,u1269,m84,COP,Lady! Be quiet.
42178,L270409,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Because if you are...
42179,L270408,u1269,m84,COP,Wait here.
42180,L270407,u1273,m84,MAUDE,I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
42181,L270406,u1269,m84,COP,Where are the papers?
42182,L270405,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?"
42183,L270404,u1269,m84,COP,Then whose name is it registered in?
42184,L270403,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
42185,L270402,u1269,m84,COP,And that truck - is it registered in your name?
42186,L270401,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Check.
42187,L270400,u1269,m84,COP,"Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?"
42188,L270399,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job."
42189,L270398,u1269,m84,COP,"Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B..."
42190,L270397,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Officer, I can explain."
42191,L270396,u1269,m84,COP,Possession of a stolen shovel.
42192,L270395,u1273,m84,MAUDE,No.
42193,L270394,u1269,m84,COP,Is this your shovel?
42194,L270393,u1273,m84,MAUDE,We planted it.
42195,L270392,u1269,m84,COP,"You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?"
42196,L270391,u1273,m84,MAUDE,But there is a family resemblance.
42197,L270390,u1269,m84,COP,Out!
42198,L270389,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, well. Must have been your brother."
42199,L270388,u1269,m84,COP,"None of that, lady."
42200,L270387,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Haven't we met before?
42201,L270386,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Hello.
42202,L270385,u1269,m84,COP,"Okay, lady. Out."
42203,L270375,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you."
42204,L270374,u1269,m84,COP,"Lady, let me get this straight."
42205,L270373,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible."
42206,L270372,u1269,m84,COP,Your tree.
42207,L270371,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
42208,L270370,u1269,m84,COP,Took it?
42209,L270369,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"No, no. I just took it."
42210,L270368,u1269,m84,COP,Isn't this your vehicle?
42211,L270367,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?"
42212,L270366,u1269,m84,COP,Could I see your registration?
42213,L270365,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck."
42214,L270364,u1269,m84,COP,How long have you been driving?
42215,L270363,u1273,m84,MAUDE,I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
42216,L270362,u1269,m84,COP,Come again.
42217,L270361,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, I don't have one."
42218,L270360,u1269,m84,COP,Yes.
42219,L270359,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
42220,L270358,u1269,m84,COP,"Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?"
42221,L270473,u1270,m84,EDITH,"Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred..."
42222,L270472,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
42223,L270471,u1270,m84,EDITH,Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
42224,L270470,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
42225,L270469,u1270,m84,EDITH,I'm a file clerk.
42226,L270468,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,Edith was just telling me about her job.
42227,L270465,u1270,m84,EDITH,"I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine."
42228,L270464,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?"
42229,L270463,u1270,m84,EDITH,Not very.
42230,L270462,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,How interesting.
42231,L270461,u1270,m84,EDITH,I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
42232,L270460,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"And what do you do, my dear?"
42233,L270458,u1270,m84,EDITH,Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
42234,L270457,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?"
42235,L270456,u1270,m84,EDITH,Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
42236,L270454,u1270,m84,EDITH,What kind of a car is it?
42237,L270453,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical."
42238,L270419,u1271,m84,GLAUCUS,What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
42239,L270418,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Here's your shovel.
42240,L270352,u1271,m84,GLAUCUS,I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
42241,L270351,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What do you see?
42242,L270350,u1271,m84,GLAUCUS,"Exactly! Now, ask me what I see."
42243,L270349,u1272,m84,HAROLD,A block of ice.
42244,L270348,u1271,m84,GLAUCUS,"A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?"
42245,L270347,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Sorry I'm late.
42246,L270224,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
42247,L270223,u1271,m84,GLAUCUS,What do you want?
42248,L270750,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take."
42249,L270749,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Please, don't you realize? She is dying."
42250,L270738,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
42251,L270737,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
42252,L270728,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more."
42253,L270727,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
42254,L270726,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"""And this too shall pass away."""
42255,L270725,u1272,m84,HAROLD,It's true. I can't live without you.
42256,L270724,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so."
42257,L270723,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me."
42258,L270722,u1273,m84,MAUDE,I feel giddy.
42259,L270721,u1273,m84,MAUDE,I thought eighty was a good round number.
42260,L270720,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But why now?
42261,L270719,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change."
42262,L270718,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die."
42263,L270717,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary."
42264,L270716,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight."
42265,L270715,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"But you're not going anywhere, are you?"
42266,L270714,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
42267,L270713,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Farewell?
42268,L270712,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell."
42269,L270711,u1272,m84,HAROLD,... which I hope will make you very happy.
42270,L270709,u1272,m84,HAROLD,For you.
42271,L270708,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, Harold."
42272,L270707,u1272,m84,HAROLD,It's all right. It's organic.
42273,L270706,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne."
42274,L270705,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Supper for two.
42275,L270668,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, Harold. You are so young."
42276,L270667,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy."
42277,L270666,u1273,m84,MAUDE,I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
42278,L270663,u1272,m84,HAROLD,You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
42279,L270662,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old."
42280,L270661,u1272,m84,HAROLD,It looks like you. Thanks.
42281,L270656,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you."
42282,L270655,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate."
42283,L270654,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Why?
42284,L270653,u1273,m84,MAUDE,I took them out.
42285,L270652,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Why are there no photographs in these frames?
42286,L270645,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Here.
42287,L270644,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Yes.
42288,L270643,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Maude.
42289,L270642,u1273,m84,MAUDE,- end where I began.
42290,L270641,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -"
42291,L270640,u1272,m84,HAROLD,You should have been a poet.
42292,L270639,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely."
42293,L270638,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
42294,L270637,u1273,m84,MAUDE,I don't know. Perhaps.
42295,L270636,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Do you think there is any life up there?
42296,L270635,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Yes. They're old friends.
42297,L270634,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Look at the stars.
42298,L270633,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, they're my species."
42299,L270632,u1272,m84,HAROLD,You sure have a way with people.
42300,L270631,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
42301,L270630,u1272,m84,HAROLD,How about some candy floss?
42302,L270629,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience."
42303,L270628,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
42304,L270627,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Oh, you weren't scared."
42305,L270626,u1273,m84,MAUDE,No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
42306,L270625,u1272,m84,HAROLD,That wasn't very scary.
42307,L270618,u1272,m84,HAROLD,She took my head.
42308,L270617,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
42309,L270616,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Just like this.
42310,L270613,u1272,m84,HAROLD,... of you. You'll all end up like this.
42311,L270612,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Don't you advance on me.
42312,L270609,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?"
42313,L270608,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least..."
42314,L270554,u1273,m84,MAUDE,What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
42315,L270553,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Maude, do you think you can help me?"
42316,L270552,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided."
42317,L270551,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Really. Just put it there, Harold."
42318,L270550,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But they'll put me in jail.
42319,L270548,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, don't go."
42320,L270547,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But they have.
42321,L270546,u1273,m84,MAUDE,But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
42322,L270545,u1272,m84,HAROLD,They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
42323,L270544,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"What is it, Harold?"
42324,L270543,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Maude, I must speak to you."
42325,L270500,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness..."
42326,L270499,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I've never met her. My mother set it up.
42327,L270498,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Oh.
42328,L270497,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl."
42329,L270496,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl."
42330,L270495,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
42331,L270494,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"From the guys who got the matches, of course."
42332,L270493,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Where's that?
42333,L270492,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. ""Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."""
42334,L270491,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yodeling?
42335,L270490,u1273,m84,MAUDE,No. I feel more like - yodeling.
42336,L270489,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Want to join me in some cartwheels?
42337,L270488,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much."
42338,L270487,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No. I'd feel stupid.
42339,L270486,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, why don't you?"
42340,L270485,u1272,m84,HAROLD,This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
42341,L270484,u1273,m84,MAUDE,With Life.
42342,L270483,u1272,m84,HAROLD,With God?
42343,L270482,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Pray? No.  I communicate.
42344,L270481,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Maude, do you pray?"
42345,L270480,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
42346,L270479,u1272,m84,HAROLD,And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
42347,L270478,u1273,m84,MAUDE,It's so blue.
42348,L270477,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Look at that sky.  It's so big.
42349,L270452,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz."
42350,L270451,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"I like you, Maude."
42351,L270450,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an ""L."" Give me an ""I.""  Give me a ""V."" Give me an ""E."" LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room."
42352,L270447,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Okay.
42353,L270446,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Of course.
42354,L270445,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?"
42355,L270444,u1273,m84,MAUDE,How ingenious! Tell me about them.
42356,L270443,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
42357,L270442,u1273,m84,MAUDE,What was that?
42358,L270441,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
42359,L270440,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. ""The wisest,"" he said, ""the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times."" Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - ""And this too shall pass away.""  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully."
42360,L270439,u1272,m84,HAROLD,You are the wisest person I know.
42361,L270438,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have."
42362,L270437,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Did Confucius say that?
42363,L270436,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, ""Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."""
42364,L270435,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I'm sure picking up on vices.
42365,L270434,u1273,m84,MAUDE,It's all right.  It's organic.
42366,L270433,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Well, I really don't smoke."
42367,L270432,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?"
42368,L270431,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I like Glaucus.
42369,L270430,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
42370,L270429,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
42371,L270428,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Yes.
42372,L270427,u1272,m84,HAROLD,The ice is melting.
42373,L270422,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Yes. It's almost there.
42374,L270421,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I <u>think</u> I see it.
42375,L270416,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus."
42376,L270415,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly."
42377,L270382,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things."
42378,L270381,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I don't know.
42379,L270380,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. ""The earth is my body. My head is in the stars.""  Who said that?"
42380,L270379,u1273,m84,MAUDE,The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
42381,L270378,u1272,m84,HAROLD,He's stopped.
42382,L270377,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes."
42383,L270376,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I think he's following us.
42384,L270338,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Superb.
42385,L270337,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Okay?
42386,L270334,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me."
42387,L270333,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But I don't play anything.
42388,L270332,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together."
42389,L270330,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Oh come on. I'll teach you.
42390,L270329,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Well, I don't..."
42391,L270328,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?"
42392,L270327,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No more revolts.
42393,L270326,u1273,m84,MAUDE,No.
42394,L270323,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government."
42395,L270322,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What were you fighting for?
42396,L270321,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago."
42397,L270320,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What's that?
42398,L270319,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Thank you.
42399,L270318,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
42400,L270317,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Thank you.
42401,L270316,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, it's all right. It's organic."
42402,L270315,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Well, I really don't drink..."
42403,L270314,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?"
42404,L270312,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Yes.
42405,L270311,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Look, the ice is melting."
42406,L270310,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake."
42407,L270309,u1272,m84,HAROLD,It is kind of rough.
42408,L270308,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream."
42409,L270307,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What is that he's working on?
42410,L270306,u1273,m84,MAUDE,We'll come back in the morning.
42411,L270305,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"He's fallen asleep, as usual."
42412,L270304,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Is he all right?
42413,L270303,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, my. We're too late."
42414,L270294,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Oh, wait, Maude. Look!"
42415,L270293,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on."
42416,L270292,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?"
42417,L270291,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Exactly.
42418,L270290,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But this is public property.
42419,L270289,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Why not?
42420,L270288,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But we can't just dig it up!
42421,L270287,u1273,m84,MAUDE,We'll transplant it. To the forest.
42422,L270286,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But what?
42423,L270285,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life."
42424,L270284,u1273,m84,MAUDE,That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
42425,L270283,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What is it?
42426,L270282,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Over there by the courthouse.
42427,L270281,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What?
42428,L270280,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Look.
42429,L270279,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What happened?
42430,L270278,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Well...
42431,L270277,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?"
42432,L270276,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages."
42433,L270275,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that."
42434,L270270,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oooh, but they are not. Look."
42435,L270269,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Because they are all the same.
42436,L270268,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Why do you say that?
42437,L270267,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I don't know. Just one of those.
42438,L270266,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?"
42439,L270263,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What do you mean?
42440,L270262,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?"
42441,L270260,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?"
42442,L270259,u1272,m84,HAROLD,That's a nice teapot.
42443,L270258,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious."
42444,L270257,u1272,m84,HAROLD,You don't look eighty.
42445,L270256,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
42446,L270255,u1272,m84,HAROLD,You look as if you could.
42447,L270254,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever."
42448,L270253,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Certainly a new experience for me.
42449,L270252,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie."
42450,L270249,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it."
42451,L270248,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Oh. Eh, I like it."
42452,L270247,u1273,m84,MAUDE,What do you think?
42453,L270245,u1272,m84,HAROLD,That's really great.
42454,L270244,u1273,m84,MAUDE,It goes on and on.
42455,L270243,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
42456,L270242,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
42457,L270240,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my ""Odorifics."""
42458,L270239,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes. Very much.
42459,L270238,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled ""Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant."" Do you like it?"
42460,L270237,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the ""Rape of Rome"" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan."
42461,L270236,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No.
42462,L270235,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Really. Do you think it's wrong?
42463,L270234,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Me! No. Of course not.
42464,L270233,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
42465,L270232,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Do you often model for Glaucus?
42466,L270231,u1273,m84,MAUDE,She seemed yare to me.
42467,L270230,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Oh, it's fine. Fine."
42468,L270229,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?"
42469,L270228,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Eh, fine."
42470,L270227,u1273,m84,MAUDE,How about some ginger pie?
42471,L270226,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Maude???!
42472,L270225,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Harold?
42473,L270160,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Promise?
42474,L270159,u1272,m84,HAROLD,All right.
42475,L270158,u1273,m84,MAUDE,My door is always open.
42476,L270157,u1272,m84,HAROLD,All right.
42477,L270156,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, then, you must come back and visit."
42478,L270155,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Sort of.
42479,L270154,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, at the dentist's?"
42480,L270153,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it."
42481,L270152,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Well then.
42482,L270151,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No.
42483,L270150,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?"
42484,L270149,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Thank you, but I really have to go."
42485,L270148,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea."
42486,L270146,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, look! The birds."
42487,L270145,u1272,m84,HAROLD,It's very interesting.
42488,L270144,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean."
42489,L270142,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff..."
42490,L270141,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right."
42491,L270140,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't ""ownership"" a little absurd?"
42492,L270139,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
42493,L270138,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it."
42494,L270137,u1272,m84,HAROLD,And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
42495,L270136,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation."
42496,L270133,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Oh.
42497,L270132,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yearse!
42498,L270131,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Your hearse?
42499,L270130,u1272,m84,HAROLD,But this is my car.
42500,L270129,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?"
42501,L270128,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes.
42502,L270127,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?"
42503,L270126,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes.
42504,L270103,u1273,m84,MAUDE,No.  I thought not.
42505,L270102,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Eh, no."
42506,L270101,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Do you sing and dance?
42507,L270100,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What?
42508,L270099,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Do you dance?
42509,L270098,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again."
42510,L270097,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"No, thank you. I have my car."
42511,L270096,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?"
42512,L270095,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?"
42513,L270094,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Nice to meet you.
42514,L270093,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude."
42515,L270092,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Harold Chasen.
42516,L270091,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, of course. What is your name?"
42517,L270090,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?"
42518,L270089,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak."
42519,L270085,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon."
42520,L270084,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I don't know.
42521,L270083,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?"
42522,L270082,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Eh, no."
42523,L270081,u1273,m84,MAUDE,You're welcome.  Did you know him?
42524,L270080,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Eh, no. Thank you."
42525,L270700,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Perhaps it is.
42526,L270699,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,This is insane.
42527,L270698,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,Harold!
42528,L270697,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I'm going to marry the woman I love.
42529,L270694,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"You don't care! ""Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!"" Listen to me..."
42530,L270693,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I don't care what people say.
42531,L270692,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!"
42532,L270691,u1272,m84,HAROLD,At a funeral.
42533,L270690,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
42534,L270683,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,A sunflower?
42535,L270682,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What?
42536,L270681,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold."
42537,L270680,u1272,m84,HAROLD,To a girl. Here.
42538,L270679,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,To whom?
42539,L270678,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I'm getting married.
42540,L270677,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?"
42541,L270676,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Mother. I'm going to get married.
42542,L270675,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Harold, please! I'm on the phone."
42543,L270674,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Mother.
42544,L270673,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?"
42545,L270672,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Mother.
42546,L270036,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets..."
42547,L270035,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I have a sore throat.
42548,L270034,u1274,m84,MRS. CHASEN,"Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of ""enfluence"" and ""d'argent"" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?"
42549,L270529,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No. Like this.
42550,L270528,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,Like a tea ceremony?
42551,L270527,u1272,m84,HAROLD,An ancient Japanese ceremony.
42552,L270526,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
42553,L270525,u1272,m84,HAROLD,This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
42554,L270522,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,"Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did ""What Price Glory?"" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent."
42555,L270521,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No. My uncle.
42556,L270520,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,"Oh, is this your father?"
42557,L270519,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,"Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument."
42558,L270518,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
42559,L270517,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,Do you play?
42560,L270516,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,"Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on ""Sunshine."" Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here."
42561,L270515,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Is Sunshine your real name?
42562,L270514,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,"No, thank you. They stain my fingers."
42563,L270513,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Would you like a cigarette?
42564,L270509,u1278,m84,SUNSHINE,Can't complain.
42565,L270508,u1272,m84,HAROLD,How do you do?
42566,L270192,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,What kind of stuff?
42567,L270191,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff."
42568,L270190,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,What would you say?
42569,L270189,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I'd have liked to talk to him.
42570,L270188,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Why?
42571,L270187,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No.  I'd have liked to.
42572,L270186,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?"
42573,L270185,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
42574,L270184,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes.
42575,L270183,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?"
42576,L270182,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I burnt down the Chemistry building.
42577,L270181,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Then why did you leave?
42578,L270180,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes.
42579,L270179,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Your studies?
42580,L270178,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes.
42581,L270177,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Your classmates?
42582,L270176,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes.
42583,L270175,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,You liked your teachers?
42584,L270174,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes.
42585,L270173,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?"
42586,L270172,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No.
42587,L270171,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
42588,L270170,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No.
42589,L270169,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Would you care to talk about this friend?
42590,L270168,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Well, maybe one."
42591,L270167,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,None at all?
42592,L270166,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No.
42593,L270165,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
42594,L270164,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Huh?
42595,L270163,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Harold?
42596,L270069,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I go to funerals.
42597,L270068,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?"
42598,L270067,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,What else do you like?
42599,L270066,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
42600,L270065,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
42601,L270064,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I don't know.
42602,L270063,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
42603,L270062,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Yes. What kind of things do you do?
42604,L270061,u1272,m84,HAROLD,You mean when I'm not working on a...
42605,L270060,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?"
42606,L270059,u1272,m84,HAROLD,My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
42607,L270058,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,What about the draft?
42608,L270057,u1272,m84,HAROLD,No.
42609,L270056,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
42610,L270055,u1272,m84,HAROLD,And a lot of time.
42611,L270054,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"Ah, yes."
42612,L270053,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I put a lot of effort into these things.
42613,L270052,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Why?
42614,L270051,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Yes. It does.
42615,L270050,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Does that worry you?
42616,L270049,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
42617,L270048,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?"
42618,L270047,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"I wouldn't say ""benefit."""
42619,L270046,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
42620,L270045,u1272,m84,HAROLD,A rough estimate.
42621,L270044,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Fifteen.
42622,L270043,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen."
42623,L270042,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,Just give me a rough estimate.
42624,L270041,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming..."
42625,L270040,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,And why is that?
42626,L270039,u1272,m84,HAROLD,An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
42627,L270038,u1277,m84,PSYCHIATRIST,"Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?"
42628,L270620,u1272,m84,HAROLD,She took my head.
42629,L270619,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Stay where you are, Harold ."
42630,L270611,u1272,m84,HAROLD,She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
42631,L270610,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Harold, calm down! This is..."
42632,L270607,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
42633,L270606,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Harold!
42634,L270605,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Parasite!
42635,L270601,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
42636,L270600,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Boy, to think I could maybe make my own."
42637,L270599,u1272,m84,HAROLD,What's the chance of getting one of these?
42638,L270598,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Harold!
42639,L270597,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates."
42640,L270596,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Souvenirs?
42641,L270595,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Sir, how about souvenirs?"
42642,L270594,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Harold, I think you're getting carried away here."
42643,L270593,u1272,m84,HAROLD,I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
42644,L270592,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Well, I don't..."
42645,L270591,u1272,m84,HAROLD,How about to slit his throat?
42646,L270590,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Eh?
42647,L270589,u1272,m84,HAROLD,To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
42648,L270588,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Yes.
42649,L270587,u1272,m84,HAROLD,How about hand-to-hand combat?
42650,L270586,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Oh sure.
42651,L270585,u1272,m84,HAROLD,And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
42652,L270584,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Oh, sure. A variety of weapons."
42653,L270583,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Will they really teach me to shoot?
42654,L270582,u1272,m84,HAROLD,ZAT!
42655,L270581,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Yes.
42656,L270580,u1272,m84,HAROLD,Another man's life in your sights.
42657,L270579,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,The moment of truth.
42658,L270578,u1272,m84,HAROLD,To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
42659,L270577,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,That's right.
42660,L270576,u1272,m84,HAROLD,To pit your own life against another.
42661,L270575,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,It's the greatest excitement in the world.
42662,L270574,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting."
42663,L270573,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
42664,L270572,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"You think so, sir?"
42665,L270571,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own."
42666,L270570,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Jeez! That's a great story,"
42667,L270569,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! ""Throw the grenades,"" I shouted. ""Mac, throw the grenades!"" ""He's dead,"" Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. ""Did we hold?"" I asked the medic. ""Yes, sir,"" he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness."
42668,L270567,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff."
42669,L270566,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support."
42670,L270565,u1272,m84,HAROLD,War is not all black.
42671,L270564,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black."
42672,L270563,u1272,m84,HAROLD,During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
42673,L270562,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge."
42674,L270560,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites."
42675,L270559,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Yes, sir."
42676,L270558,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Call me ""sir,"" Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect."
42677,L270557,u1272,m84,HAROLD,"Thank you, Uncle."
42678,L270556,u1279,m84,UNCLE VICTOR,"Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot."
42679,L270302,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery."
42680,L270301,u1275,m84,OFFICER,Oh yes. That's fine.
42681,L270300,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
42682,L270299,u1275,m84,OFFICER,"Eh, yes, ma'm."
42683,L270298,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Well, it's a tricky turn."
42684,L270297,u1275,m84,OFFICER,"Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking."
42685,L270296,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?"
42686,L270124,u1276,m84,PRIEST,But wait...
42687,L270123,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time."
42688,L270122,u1276,m84,PRIEST,"Well, I didn't."
42689,L270121,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Oh, yes. How did you like that?"
42690,L270120,u1276,m84,PRIEST,Were you also the one who painted the statues?
42691,L270119,u1273,m84,MAUDE,"Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold."
42692,L270118,u1276,m84,PRIEST,Yes.
42693,L270117,u1273,m84,MAUDE,Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
42694,L270116,u1276,m84,PRIEST,"Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?"
42695,L273833,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,Time to play.
42696,L273832,u1280,m85,FEMALE CENOBITE,"No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play."
42697,L273831,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
42698,L273709,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,We have no more surprises.
42699,L273708,u1280,m85,FEMALE CENOBITE,We've always been here.
42700,L273707,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,It's different for us.
42701,L273699,u1280,m85,FEMALE CENOBITE,Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
42702,L273698,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,"Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it."
42703,L273762,u1282,m85,JULIA,"Oh, I do. I do."
42704,L273761,u1281,m85,FRANK,Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
42705,L273760,u1282,m85,JULIA,You knew?
42706,L273759,u1281,m85,FRANK,I knew you'd come.
42707,L273758,u1282,m85,JULIA,Frank.
42708,L273757,u1281,m85,FRANK,Julia.
42709,L273756,u1282,m85,JULIA,"Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet."
42710,L273746,u1281,m85,FRANK,"I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty."
42711,L273745,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
42712,L273741,u1281,m85,FRANK,Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
42713,L273740,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,He... he loved me.
42714,L273738,u1281,m85,FRANK,"'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all."
42715,L273737,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
42716,L273736,u1281,m85,FRANK,See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
42717,L273735,u1281,m85,FRANK,Shit. Bull. Shit.
42718,L273734,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Yes!
42719,L273733,u1281,m85,FRANK,"Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?"
42720,L273868,u1282,m85,JULIA,I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
42721,L273867,u1285,m85,MALAHIDE,I knew you'd come back.
42722,L273720,u1282,m85,JULIA,"Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go."
42723,L273719,u1285,m85,MALAHIDE,I want to go back!
42724,L273675,u1282,m85,JULIA,It certainly is.
42725,L273674,u1285,m85,MALAHIDE,It's coming.
42726,L273673,u1282,m85,JULIA,She certainly has.
42727,L273672,u1285,m85,MALAHIDE,She's done it.
42728,L273600,u1282,m85,JULIA,I know.
42729,L273599,u1285,m85,MALAHIDE,It's a beautiful dress...
42730,L273595,u1285,m85,MALAHIDE,No. You look...
42731,L273594,u1282,m85,JULIA,Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
42732,L273593,u1285,m85,MALAHIDE,Yes... Yes. You look...
42733,L273641,u1284,m85,KYLE,I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
42734,L273640,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"Kyle, you don't have..."
42735,L273639,u1284,m85,KYLE,O.K. Let's go.
42736,L273636,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Because I'm going to get my father!
42737,L273635,u1284,m85,KYLE,WHY?
42738,L273634,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!"
42739,L273633,u1284,m85,KYLE,Are you crazy?
42740,L273632,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Get out of the way.
42741,L273629,u1284,m85,KYLE,Yeah. The things you were talking about.
42742,L273628,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
42743,L273627,u1284,m85,KYLE,The boxes! I TOLD you.
42744,L273626,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,What do you mean?
42745,L273625,u1284,m85,KYLE,The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
42746,L273624,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,What?
42747,L273623,u1284,m85,KYLE,The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
42748,L273622,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,The box. I need the box.
42749,L273620,u1284,m85,KYLE,"Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me."
42750,L273619,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
42751,L273618,u1284,m85,KYLE,"God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know."
42752,L273617,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,And you're sure it was a woman?
42753,L273612,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?"
42754,L273611,u1284,m85,KYLE,"Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on..."
42755,L273609,u1284,m85,KYLE,So you slept O.K.?
42756,L273608,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,No bad dreams.
42757,L273568,u1284,m85,KYLE,"If anyone can help, HE can."
42758,L273567,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy."
42759,L273565,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
42760,L273564,u1284,m85,KYLE,"Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I..."
42761,L273563,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!"
42762,L273562,u1284,m85,KYLE,What?
42763,L273561,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,I... I had a visitor.
42764,L273551,u1284,m85,KYLE,"Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out."
42765,L273550,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"God, that's terrible."
42766,L273549,u1284,m85,KYLE,Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
42767,L273548,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,What's the matter with her?
42768,L273547,u1284,m85,KYLE,"Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY."
42769,L273531,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"You a doctor, too?"
42770,L273530,u1284,m85,KYLE,"So... You're Kirsty, huh?"
42771,L273874,u1288,m85,TIFFANY,It's been Hell.
42772,L273873,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Well... G'bye.
42773,L273860,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
42774,L273859,u1288,m85,TIFFANY,I'm scared.
42775,L273854,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Finish what?
42776,L273853,u1288,m85,TIFFANY,I've got to finish it.
42777,L273852,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,What are you talking...
42778,L273851,u1288,m85,TIFFANY,I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
42779,L273845,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,You were ALL human!
42780,L273844,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,I... remember.
42781,L273841,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
42782,L273840,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,"Nonsense, I..."
42783,L273839,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU."
42784,L273838,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,"What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?"
42785,L273837,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,"Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell."
42786,L273836,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
42787,L273835,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,"No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining."
42788,L273834,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Wait!
42789,L273706,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,And what about you?
42790,L273705,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,"But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours."
42791,L273702,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,I've come for my father!
42792,L273701,u1286,m85,PINHEAD,Then why are you here?
42793,L273700,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,But I didn't open it! I didn't!
42794,L273518,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,The Cenobites.
42795,L273517,u1287,m85,RONSON,Who?
42796,L273516,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
42797,L273515,u1287,m85,RONSON,"Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now."
42798,L273505,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
42799,L273504,u1287,m85,RONSON,What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
42800,L273498,u1287,m85,RONSON,Yeah.
42801,L273497,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,"He talked about Demons, huh?"
42802,L273496,u1287,m85,RONSON,"Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap."
42803,L273495,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,I thought Steve had talked to you?
42804,L273488,u1287,m85,RONSON,"Oh, excuse me..."
42805,L273487,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,What are you talking about? Who are you?
42806,L273486,u1287,m85,RONSON,"What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?"
42807,L273485,u1287,m85,RONSON,"Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story."
42808,L273484,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Steve...
42809,L273483,u1287,m85,RONSON,"You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?"
42810,L273482,u1283,m85,KIRSTY,Where am I?
42811,L274152,u1297,m86,MANNING,Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
42812,L274151,u1289,m86,ABE,"They were over here, Professor."
42813,L274150,u1289,m86,ABE,Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
42814,L274149,u1297,m86,MANNING,Is he serious??
42815,L274148,u1289,m86,ABE,"The past, the future, whatever this object holds."
42816,L274147,u1297,m86,MANNING,See what??
42817,L274146,u1289,m86,ABE,"I need to touch it to ""see""..."
42818,L274265,u1289,m86,ABE,"Oh, right --"
42819,L274264,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
42820,L274263,u1289,m86,ABE,Remind me why I keep doing this.
42821,L274207,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Didn't even buy me a drink.
42822,L274206,u1289,m86,ABE,Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
42823,L274200,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,"I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!"
42824,L274199,u1289,m86,ABE,Red. How long was it latched onto you?
42825,L274190,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,I'm lucky that way.
42826,L274189,u1289,m86,ABE,You were burned by some organic acid.
42827,L274088,u1289,m86,ABE,"No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --"
42828,L274087,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Nah -- he's taken care of.
42829,L274082,u1289,m86,ABE,"Red, I found something --"

42831,L274078,u1289,m86,ABE,"Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry."
42832,L274077,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,"Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works."
42833,L274064,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,We don't take hints.
42834,L274063,u1289,m86,ABE,"Liz left us, Red. Take the hint."

42836,L274061,u1289,m86,ABE,Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
42837,L274060,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Don't get psychic with me.
42838,L274059,u1289,m86,ABE,"You mean, outside... with her."

42851,L273933,u1291,m86,BROOM,Cordon off the area. Something came through.
42852,L273912,u1300,m86,WHITMAN,Air and sea backup. What's closest?
42853,L273911,u1291,m86,BROOM,"If he's here, this is worse than I thought."

42975,L274463,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.

42981,L274426,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,I won't take 'em. They never work.
42982,L274425,u1297,m86,MANNING,Each of us gets a belt.
42983,L274424,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Those things never work. Never.
42984,L274423,u1297,m86,MANNING,"We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use..."
42985,L274422,u1297,m86,MANNING,When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.

42990,L274303,u1297,m86,MANNING,That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
42991,L274302,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,"No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?"
42992,L274301,u1297,m86,MANNING,"Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then."
42993,L274300,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,I knew those men better than you did --
42994,L274299,u1297,m86,MANNING,But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
42995,L274516,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,How big can it be?
42996,L274515,u1299,m86,MYERS,Alone?
42997,L274514,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
42998,L274446,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,"On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one."

43052,L274406,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
43053,L274404,u1295,m86,LIZ,I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
43054,L274403,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Hi.
43055,L274335,u1295,m86,LIZ,"Oh, okay then. Maybe later then."
43056,L274334,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
43057,L274329,u1295,m86,LIZ,No. Myers is taking me.
43058,L274328,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,You're going alone?
43059,L274327,u1295,m86,LIZ,"For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read."
43060,L274326,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Out? Out out?
43061,L274325,u1295,m86,LIZ,"Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --"
43062,L274324,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
43063,L274180,u1295,m86,LIZ,Goodnight.
43064,L274179,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,"Goodnight, then."
43065,L274171,u1295,m86,LIZ,"No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it."
43066,L274170,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,"We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --"
43067,L274169,u1294,m86,HELLBOY,Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
43068,L274168,u1295,m86,LIZ,You better have that looked at.
43069,L274481,u1299,m86,MYERS,What?
43070,L274480,u1295,m86,LIZ,Hit me.
43071,L274474,u1295,m86,LIZ,"You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same."
43072,L274473,u1299,m86,MYERS,That you feel that way about me.
43073,L274472,u1295,m86,LIZ,What -- ?
43074,L274471,u1299,m86,MYERS,"But it's not true, is it?"
43075,L274359,u1295,m86,LIZ,Coffee's warming me up.
43076,L274358,u1299,m86,MYERS,"It's freezing, isn't it?"
43077,L274355,u1295,m86,LIZ,"Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --"
43078,L274354,u1299,m86,MYERS,What about you?
43079,L274353,u1295,m86,LIZ,I know.
43080,L274352,u1299,m86,MYERS,He -- loves you.
43081,L274351,u1299,m86,MYERS,My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
43082,L274350,u1295,m86,LIZ,A brute.
43083,L274349,u1299,m86,MYERS,Strong.
43084,L274348,u1295,m86,LIZ,Cocky.
43085,L274347,u1299,m86,MYERS,No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
43086,L274346,u1295,m86,LIZ,He's just pushy.
43087,L274345,u1299,m86,MYERS,I admire him. He's a force of nature.
43088,L274251,u1299,m86,MYERS,"Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice."
43089,L274250,u1295,m86,LIZ,Doesn't sounds like him.
43090,L274249,u1299,m86,MYERS,"Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks."
43091,L274248,u1299,m86,MYERS,It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
43092,L274247,u1295,m86,LIZ,"60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED ""LIZ""."
43093,L274246,u1299,m86,MYERS,Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
43094,L273988,u1296,m86,LOBBY GUARD,"Two steps back, please."
43095,L273987,u1299,m86,MYERS,Pardon?
43096,L273986,u1296,m86,LOBBY GUARD,-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
43097,L273985,u1299,m86,MYERS,"Yes, I --"
43098,L273984,u1296,m86,LOBBY GUARD,-- Late. Five minutes late.
43099,L273983,u1299,m86,MYERS,"Hello, I'm --"
43100,L274691,u1301,m87,1ST MAN,Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
43101,L274690,u1308,m87,LARRY,You fucking ass-holes.
43102,L274689,u1308,m87,LARRY,My fucking hand!
43103,L274688,u1301,m87,1ST MAN,What's the problem?
43104,L274687,u1308,m87,LARRY,Christ!
43105,L274612,u1301,m87,1ST MAN,"Oh, sod you."
43106,L274611,u1308,m87,LARRY,Just take it slowly.
43107,L274610,u1301,m87,1ST MAN,"Look, do you want the bed in or not?"
43108,L274609,u1308,m87,LARRY,Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
43109,L274701,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Sure.
43110,L274700,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,Will you sign for the bed?
43111,L274696,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Where's my father?
43112,L274695,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,We're leaving.
43113,L274694,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,What's happening?
43114,L274626,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Not much.
43115,L274625,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,Want to buy a bed?
43116,L274624,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Hi.
43117,L274623,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,It's my lucky day.
43118,L274646,u1308,m87,LARRY,Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
43119,L274645,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,Lucky man.
43120,L274644,u1308,m87,LARRY,Julia's my second wife.
43121,L274643,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,Oh.
43122,L274642,u1308,m87,LARRY,Her mother's dead.
43123,L274641,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,Got her mother's looks.
43124,L274640,u1308,m87,LARRY,Uh-huh.
43125,L274639,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,That your daughter?
43126,L274617,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,"Do you really need this bed, lady?"
43127,L274616,u1308,m87,LARRY,"Alright, let's give it another try."
43128,L274614,u1308,m87,LARRY,It'll go in.
43129,L274613,u1302,m87,2ND MAN,"Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says."
43130,L275289,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,You can keep them.
43131,L275288,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,We've got such sights to show you --
43132,L275287,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Stay the fuck away from me.
43133,L275286,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,Just in time.
43134,L275242,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,No. That wasn't the deal.
43135,L275241,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,We want the man who did this --
43136,L275196,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
43137,L275195,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
43138,L275192,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,HE did. I've seen him.
43139,L275191,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,Nobody escapes us.
43140,L275188,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,To a man called Frank Cotton?
43141,L275187,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,Many times.
43142,L275186,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"You did this before, right?"
43143,L275185,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,No time for argument.
43144,L275183,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
43145,L275182,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"Let me alone, will you?"
43146,L275166,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,No!
43147,L275165,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,"He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us."
43148,L275159,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
43149,L275158,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,This isn't for real.
43150,L275156,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from."
43151,L275155,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
43152,L275154,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Who are you?
43153,L275153,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
43154,L275152,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,It's just a puzzle box.
43155,L275151,u1303,m87,CENOBITE,The box... you opened it. We came.
43156,L275123,u1304,m87,DOCTOR,We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
43157,L275122,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Oh Christ.
43158,L275121,u1304,m87,DOCTOR,Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
43159,L275120,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I don't remember.
43160,L275119,u1304,m87,DOCTOR,You were holding onto it like grim death.
43161,L275115,u1304,m87,DOCTOR,First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
43162,L275114,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Please listen to me --
43163,L275113,u1304,m87,DOCTOR,You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
43164,L275112,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,It's important.
43165,L275111,u1304,m87,DOCTOR,"That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed."
43166,L275110,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I have to speak to my father.
43167,L275109,u1304,m87,DOCTOR,Please. Get back into bed.
43168,L275273,u1305,m87,FRANK,"That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK."
43169,L275272,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Frank --
43170,L275271,u1305,m87,FRANK,Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
43171,L275270,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Bastard.
43172,L275269,u1305,m87,FRANK,Poor baby.
43173,L275268,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,You bastard --
43174,L275267,u1305,m87,FRANK,Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
43175,L275266,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Oh my God.
43176,L275100,u1305,m87,FRANK,Some things have to be endured...
43177,L275099,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,This isn't happening.
43178,L275098,u1305,m87,FRANK,Come to Daddy.
43179,L275092,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,You want it?
43180,L275091,u1305,m87,FRANK,One last time. Give me the box.
43181,L275090,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,No.
43182,L275088,u1305,m87,FRANK,I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
43183,L275087,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,This isn't happening.
43184,L275086,u1305,m87,FRANK,"I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful."
43185,L275085,u1305,m87,FRANK,What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
43186,L275084,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Don't touch me. Or so help me --
43187,L275081,u1305,m87,FRANK,Come to Daddy.
43188,L275080,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,No.
43189,L275079,u1305,m87,FRANK,You remember.
43190,L275078,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,No.
43191,L275077,u1305,m87,FRANK,Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
43192,L275075,u1305,m87,FRANK,Kirsty?
43193,L275074,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Julia!
43194,L275135,u1305,m87,FRANK,I need a skin. Then we leave --
43195,L275134,u1306,m87,JULIA,Well we can't just stay here --
43196,L275133,u1305,m87,FRANK,Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
43197,L275132,u1306,m87,JULIA,Maybe we should just leave --
43198,L275131,u1305,m87,FRANK,There's very little I can do about it.
43199,L275130,u1306,m87,JULIA,Don't you care?
43200,L275129,u1305,m87,FRANK,Maybe.
43201,L275128,u1306,m87,JULIA,That's probably her now. Or the police.
43202,L275127,u1305,m87,FRANK,I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
43203,L275126,u1306,m87,JULIA,She'll tell them everything...
43204,L275060,u1305,m87,FRANK,"Then find me somebody else, before they come looking."
43205,L275059,u1306,m87,JULIA,I said no.
43206,L275058,u1305,m87,FRANK,So where's the harm?
43207,L275057,u1306,m87,JULIA,I don't.
43208,L275056,u1305,m87,FRANK,You can't love him.
43209,L274994,u1306,m87,JULIA,Yes. They'll never find us.
43210,L274993,u1305,m87,FRANK,"It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?"
43211,L274992,u1306,m87,JULIA,And the blood let you out?
43212,L274991,u1305,m87,FRANK,"They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it."
43213,L274990,u1305,m87,FRANK,"No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible."
43214,L274989,u1306,m87,JULIA,So you were cheated.
43215,L274988,u1305,m87,FRANK,You would be. They tore me apart.
43216,L274987,u1306,m87,JULIA,You're still afraid.
43217,L274986,u1305,m87,FRANK,The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
43218,L274985,u1306,m87,JULIA,Who did?
43219,L274984,u1305,m87,FRANK,Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
43220,L274983,u1306,m87,JULIA,And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
43221,L274982,u1305,m87,FRANK,I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
43222,L274981,u1306,m87,JULIA,Hell...
43223,L274980,u1305,m87,FRANK,To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
43224,L274979,u1306,m87,JULIA,What kind of doors?
43225,L274978,u1305,m87,FRANK,Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
43226,L274977,u1306,m87,JULIA,Let me see.
43227,L274976,u1305,m87,FRANK,It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
43228,L274975,u1306,m87,JULIA,A box?
43229,L274974,u1305,m87,FRANK,This is what began it.
43230,L274973,u1306,m87,JULIA,You promised me an explanation.
43231,L274972,u1305,m87,FRANK,A long time.
43232,L274969,u1306,m87,JULIA,"Tell me, damn you."
43233,L274968,u1305,m87,FRANK,Not know.
43234,L274967,u1306,m87,JULIA,I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
43235,L274966,u1305,m87,FRANK,What?
43236,L274965,u1306,m87,JULIA,Later.
43237,L274964,u1305,m87,FRANK,Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
43238,L274963,u1306,m87,JULIA,Well?
43239,L274945,u1305,m87,FRANK,"You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse..."
43240,L274944,u1306,m87,JULIA,You're hurting.
43241,L274943,u1305,m87,FRANK,Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
43242,L274942,u1306,m87,JULIA,Keep your voice down.
43243,L274941,u1305,m87,FRANK,Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
43244,L274937,u1305,m87,FRANK,The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
43245,L274936,u1306,m87,JULIA,Who?
43246,L274935,u1305,m87,FRANK,"-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking."
43247,L274934,u1305,m87,FRANK,One more. Maybe two --
43248,L274933,u1306,m87,JULIA,Good.
43249,L274932,u1305,m87,FRANK,My nerves... are beginning to work again.
43250,L274931,u1306,m87,JULIA,Hurting.
43251,L274930,u1305,m87,FRANK,I'm hurting
43252,L274792,u1305,m87,FRANK,The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
43253,L274791,u1306,m87,JULIA,What do you want me to do.
43254,L274790,u1305,m87,FRANK,You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
43255,L274789,u1306,m87,JULIA,Ssh!
43256,L274788,u1305,m87,FRANK,...somebody...
43257,L274780,u1305,m87,FRANK,"Just help, will you? Please God, help me --"
43258,L274779,u1306,m87,JULIA,Back from where?
43259,L274778,u1305,m87,FRANK,His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
43260,L274777,u1306,m87,JULIA,What happened to you?
43261,L274776,u1305,m87,FRANK,Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
43262,L274775,u1306,m87,JULIA,No. God no.
43263,L274774,u1305,m87,FRANK,Frank.
43264,L274773,u1306,m87,JULIA,Tell me who you are.
43265,L274772,u1305,m87,FRANK,Help me.
43266,L274771,u1305,m87,FRANK,I said: don't look.
43267,L274770,u1306,m87,JULIA,Who are you?
43268,L274769,u1305,m87,FRANK,Don't look at me.
43269,L274768,u1306,m87,JULIA,Oh my God.
43270,L274767,u1305,m87,FRANK,Julia.
43271,L274733,u1305,m87,FRANK,Sure you are.
43272,L274732,u1306,m87,JULIA,I'm very happy.
43273,L274731,u1305,m87,FRANK,Wedded bliss?
43274,L274681,u1305,m87,FRANK,Forget him.
43275,L274680,u1306,m87,JULIA,What about Larry --
43276,L274676,u1305,m87,FRANK,I don't want to see the dress.
43277,L274675,u1306,m87,JULIA,But you said --
43278,L274674,u1305,m87,FRANK,I don't want to see the dress.
43279,L274673,u1306,m87,JULIA,Well?
43280,L274660,u1306,m87,JULIA,I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
43281,L274659,u1305,m87,FRANK,Well can I come in or not?
43282,L274658,u1306,m87,JULIA,Oh.  Oh yes.
43283,L274657,u1305,m87,FRANK,There is going to BE a wedding?
43284,L274656,u1305,m87,FRANK,I came for the wedding.
43285,L274655,u1306,m87,JULIA,Oh.
43286,L274654,u1305,m87,FRANK,I'm brother Frank.
43287,L274653,u1306,m87,JULIA,That's right. Who are you?
43288,L274652,u1305,m87,FRANK,"You're Julia, right?"
43289,L275258,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Oh my God.
43290,L275257,u1306,m87,JULIA,"No, damn you --"
43291,L275220,u1306,m87,JULIA,"I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?"
43292,L275219,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I saw everything.
43293,L275218,u1306,m87,JULIA,This afternoon.
43294,L275217,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I was here this afternoon.
43295,L275216,u1306,m87,JULIA,You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
43296,L275215,u1306,m87,JULIA,Of course. There's no need to shout.
43297,L275214,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I have to see my father.
43298,L275213,u1306,m87,JULIA,What's the problem?
43299,L275212,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Where's Daddy?
43300,L275211,u1306,m87,JULIA,Kirsty? It's very late.
43301,L274722,u1306,m87,JULIA,The keys are in the kitchen.
43302,L274721,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Sure.
43303,L274720,u1306,m87,JULIA,Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
43304,L274719,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,What happened?
43305,L274667,u1306,m87,JULIA,Just to your left.
43306,L274666,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Which is where?
43307,L274665,u1306,m87,JULIA,There's a towel in the bathroom.
43308,L274664,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Hi. I got soaked.
43309,L274663,u1306,m87,JULIA,Kirsty.
43310,L275231,u1308,m87,LARRY,"He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --"
43311,L275230,u1306,m87,JULIA,Dead.
43312,L275149,u1306,m87,JULIA,It's better you see for yourself --
43313,L275148,u1308,m87,LARRY,What are you talking about?
43314,L275147,u1306,m87,JULIA,I don't know where to begin...
43315,L275146,u1308,m87,LARRY,What's wrong?
43316,L275038,u1306,m87,JULIA,Please. I can't bear it...
43317,L275037,u1308,m87,LARRY,What's wrong with you?
43318,L275036,u1306,m87,JULIA,Please...
43319,L275035,u1308,m87,LARRY,Huh?
43320,L275024,u1308,m87,LARRY,Come with me then.
43321,L275023,u1306,m87,JULIA,Don't go upstairs.
43322,L275022,u1308,m87,LARRY,Oh baby.
43323,L275016,u1308,m87,LARRY,What's wrong with you?
43324,L275015,u1306,m87,JULIA,Larry...
43325,L275013,u1308,m87,LARRY,No. I'll do it.
43326,L275012,u1306,m87,JULIA,-- I'll go see.
43327,L275005,u1308,m87,LARRY,Only I'll turn it off --
43328,L275004,u1306,m87,JULIA,Fine.
43329,L275003,u1308,m87,LARRY,Are you all right?
43330,L275002,u1306,m87,JULIA,I've seen worse.
43331,L275001,u1308,m87,LARRY,Is this upsetting you?
43332,L274958,u1308,m87,LARRY,Kirsty.
43333,L274957,u1306,m87,JULIA,Who was it?
43334,L274940,u1308,m87,LARRY,O.K.
43335,L274939,u1306,m87,JULIA,Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
43336,L274928,u1308,m87,LARRY,O.K.
43337,L274927,u1306,m87,JULIA,I'll be down in a minute
43338,L274926,u1308,m87,LARRY,Sure.
43339,L274925,u1306,m87,JULIA,Maybe a brandy.
43340,L274924,u1308,m87,LARRY,Can I get you anything?
43341,L274923,u1306,m87,JULIA,I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
43342,L274922,u1308,m87,LARRY,"Oh, babe..."
43343,L274921,u1306,m87,JULIA,Just feeling a bit sick.
43344,L274920,u1308,m87,LARRY,Are you all right?
43345,L274919,u1308,m87,LARRY,Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
43346,L274918,u1306,m87,JULIA,I'm here.
43347,L274917,u1308,m87,LARRY,Julia?
43348,L274754,u1308,m87,LARRY,Are you O.K.?
43349,L274753,u1306,m87,JULIA,Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
43350,L274729,u1308,m87,LARRY,"Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding."
43351,L274728,u1306,m87,JULIA,Larry....
43352,L274727,u1308,m87,LARRY,"Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company."
43353,L274718,u1306,m87,JULIA,No you won't.
43354,L274717,u1308,m87,LARRY,I'll be scarred for life.
43355,L274716,u1306,m87,JULIA,You're done worse.
43356,L274715,u1308,m87,LARRY,So damn stupid.
43357,L274714,u1306,m87,JULIA,Take it slowly.
43358,L274712,u1306,m87,JULIA,"No, you're not."
43359,L274711,u1308,m87,LARRY,I'm going to throw up.
43360,L274710,u1306,m87,JULIA,It's probably going to need stitches.
43361,L274709,u1306,m87,JULIA,Let me see.
43362,L274708,u1308,m87,LARRY,Shit.
43363,L274707,u1306,m87,JULIA,You're NOT going to faint.
43364,L274706,u1308,m87,LARRY,"I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood."
43365,L274705,u1306,m87,JULIA,Is it deep?
43366,L274704,u1308,m87,LARRY,I cut myself.
43367,L274703,u1306,m87,JULIA,What have you done?
43368,L274619,u1306,m87,JULIA,It looks like a bomb's dropped.
43369,L274618,u1308,m87,LARRY,How are you doing through there?
43370,L274606,u1308,m87,LARRY,We'll move in Sunday.
43371,L274605,u1306,m87,JULIA,Why not?
43372,L274604,u1308,m87,LARRY,Well?
43373,L274568,u1308,m87,LARRY,He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
43374,L274567,u1306,m87,JULIA,He's here?
43375,L274564,u1306,m87,JULIA,In here.
43376,L274563,u1308,m87,LARRY,Where are you?
43377,L274562,u1308,m87,LARRY,I hear you.
43378,L274561,u1306,m87,JULIA,Larry!
43379,L274558,u1308,m87,LARRY,Oh Christ. Julia...
43380,L274557,u1306,m87,JULIA,No argument.
43381,L274556,u1308,m87,LARRY,So what's the argument?
43382,L274555,u1306,m87,JULIA,All right.
43383,L274554,u1308,m87,LARRY,You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
43384,L274553,u1306,m87,JULIA,No. I'm not.
43385,L274552,u1308,m87,LARRY,You're still blaming me.
43386,L274549,u1306,m87,JULIA,You mean we're moving in?
43387,L274548,u1308,m87,LARRY,"You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it."
43388,L274547,u1308,m87,LARRY,He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
43389,L274546,u1306,m87,JULIA,I thought half of it was your brother's?
43390,L274545,u1308,m87,LARRY,We'll sell it. Sell everything.
43391,L274544,u1306,m87,JULIA,Not exactly modern.
43392,L274542,u1308,m87,LARRY,I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
43393,L274541,u1306,m87,JULIA,Why didn't he want to sell it?
43394,L274537,u1308,m87,LARRY,The best part of ten years.
43395,L274536,u1306,m87,JULIA,How long since you were here?
43396,L274534,u1308,m87,LARRY,It's just been empty a while.
43397,L274533,u1306,m87,JULIA,It smells damp.
43398,L274529,u1308,m87,LARRY,Ah!
43399,L274528,u1306,m87,JULIA,Just a thought --
43400,L274527,u1308,m87,LARRY,Like who?
43401,L274526,u1306,m87,JULIA,Maybe somebody changed the lock.
43402,L274525,u1308,m87,LARRY,O.K. O.K.
43403,L274524,u1306,m87,JULIA,We're going to freeze to death.
43404,L274523,u1308,m87,LARRY,It's ONE of these.
43405,L274896,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
43406,L274895,u1306,m87,JULIA,What's wrong?
43407,L274894,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,Oh Christ.
43408,L274893,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
43409,L274892,u1306,m87,JULIA,Am I?
43410,L274891,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"You know, you're very beautiful."
43411,L274890,u1306,m87,JULIA,Maybe I will.
43412,L274889,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,Why don't you do the same?
43413,L274888,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"Yeah, why don't I?"
43414,L274887,u1306,m87,JULIA,Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
43415,L274886,u1306,m87,JULIA,That's right.
43416,L274885,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,First time for everything.
43417,L274884,u1306,m87,JULIA,I prefer the floor.
43418,L274883,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,I suppose not.
43419,L274882,u1306,m87,JULIA,"We don't need a bed, do we?"
43420,L274881,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,What's going on?
43421,L274880,u1306,m87,JULIA,No.
43422,L274879,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,This isn't the bedroom.
43423,L274878,u1306,m87,JULIA,That's right.
43424,L274877,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,No personal details?
43425,L274876,u1306,m87,JULIA,"Let's keep it that way, shall we?"
43426,L274875,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"No, not much."
43427,L274874,u1306,m87,JULIA,Do you care ?
43428,L274873,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,Is this your place ?
43429,L274872,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,That's more like it.
43430,L274871,u1306,m87,JULIA,No. No. Let's go upstairs.
43431,L274870,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?"
43432,L274869,u1306,m87,JULIA,"I... suppose so, yes."
43433,L274868,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"Well, isn't it?"
43434,L274866,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years."
43435,L274865,u1306,m87,JULIA,You want something to drink?
43436,L274864,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,I suppose that's right.
43437,L274863,u1306,m87,JULIA,There's a first time for everything.
43438,L274862,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,You know it's not often I... you know...
43439,L274861,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,Oh?
43440,L274860,u1306,m87,JULIA,That depends.
43441,L274859,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?"
43442,L274858,u1306,m87,JULIA,Please.
43443,L274857,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,Plain soda?
43444,L274856,u1306,m87,JULIA,Just soda.
43445,L274855,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,What are you drinking?
43446,L274852,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"I wonder, maybe..."
43447,L274851,u1306,m87,JULIA,Not much.
43448,L274850,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,Drinking alone.
43449,L274849,u1306,m87,JULIA,What?
43450,L274848,u1310,m87,PRUDHOE,"Not much fun, is it?"
43451,L275144,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Steve.
43452,L275143,u1309,m87,NURSE,"Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?"
43453,L275142,u1309,m87,NURSE,Try me.
43454,L275141,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,You wouldn't believe me.
43455,L275140,u1309,m87,NURSE,"Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --"
43456,L275139,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
43457,L275138,u1309,m87,NURSE,I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
43458,L275137,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
43459,L275136,u1309,m87,NURSE,What a pretty tune.
43460,L275108,u1309,m87,NURSE,I won't be a moment.
43461,L275107,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Who brought me in here?
43462,L275106,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Wait a moment --
43463,L275105,u1309,m87,NURSE,I'll get the doctor.
43464,L275104,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,What happened to me?
43465,L275103,u1309,m87,NURSE,You're awake. Good girl.
43466,L275251,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I have to get out.
43467,L275250,u1308,m87,LARRY,Where are you going?
43468,L275249,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --"
43469,L275248,u1308,m87,LARRY,No. It's all over.
43470,L275247,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,PLEASE. You're in danger.
43471,L275246,u1308,m87,LARRY,What's the problem?
43472,L275245,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Get the fuck out of here.
43473,L275240,u1308,m87,LARRY,Show her.
43474,L275239,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Yes!
43475,L275238,u1308,m87,LARRY,No you don't.
43476,L275237,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I want to see.
43477,L275236,u1308,m87,LARRY,I'm afraid it's true.
43478,L275235,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I don't believe it.
43479,L275234,u1308,m87,LARRY,Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
43480,L275229,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Gone?
43481,L275228,u1308,m87,LARRY,He's gone.
43482,L275227,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Finished?
43483,L275226,u1308,m87,LARRY,Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
43484,L275225,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
43485,L275224,u1308,m87,LARRY,"It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right..."
43486,L275223,u1308,m87,LARRY,Of course.
43487,L275222,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I have to talk to you.
43488,L275055,u1308,m87,LARRY,Maybe all she needs is some company.
43489,L275054,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Sure.
43490,L275053,u1308,m87,LARRY,Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
43491,L275052,u1308,m87,LARRY,I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
43492,L275051,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,What?
43493,L275050,u1308,m87,LARRY,It's like she's waiting for something.
43494,L275049,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Really?
43495,L275048,u1308,m87,LARRY,She doesn't even want to leave the house.
43496,L275045,u1308,m87,LARRY,You don't like her at all do you?
43497,L275044,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
43498,L275043,u1308,m87,LARRY,I guess.
43499,L275042,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Maybe you should give it some time.
43500,L275041,u1308,m87,LARRY,...maybe we should never have come back.
43501,L274956,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I love you too.
43502,L274955,u1308,m87,LARRY,"I love you, honey."
43503,L274954,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Yeah.
43504,L274953,u1308,m87,LARRY,Never better. You sleep well.
43505,L274952,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
43506,L274747,u1308,m87,LARRY,Steve?
43507,L274746,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I've forgotten.
43508,L274745,u1308,m87,LARRY,"What are you drinking, love?"
43509,L274651,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Sure.
43510,L274650,u1308,m87,LARRY,Are you O.K.?
43511,L274638,u1308,m87,LARRY,Kitchen's through on your left.
43512,L274637,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
43513,L274636,u1308,m87,LARRY,Kirsty.
43514,L274635,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Surprise.
43515,L274634,u1308,m87,LARRY,"Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving."
43516,L274633,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Is Julia here?
43517,L274632,u1308,m87,LARRY,I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
43518,L274631,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Me like.
43519,L274630,u1308,m87,LARRY,You like?
43520,L274629,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Big house.
43521,L274603,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I will. See you.
43522,L274602,u1308,m87,LARRY,Call me tomorrow.
43523,L274601,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"Take care, Dad."
43524,L274600,u1308,m87,LARRY,O.K.
43525,L274599,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Of course. Every day.
43526,L274598,u1308,m87,LARRY,You will keep in touch.
43527,L274597,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
43528,L274596,u1308,m87,LARRY,I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
43529,L274595,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?"
43530,L274594,u1308,m87,LARRY,"What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --"
43531,L274593,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
43532,L274592,u1308,m87,LARRY,"Well come over, will you? See the place?"
43533,L274591,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Great.
43534,L274590,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"I'm not going to change my mind, Dad."
43535,L274589,u1308,m87,LARRY,Well I want you to see the house.
43536,L274588,u1308,m87,LARRY,Do you want me to come over?
43537,L274587,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,YOU'D like my room.
43538,L274586,u1308,m87,LARRY,You'd like the house.
43539,L274585,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,No Dad.
43540,L274584,u1308,m87,LARRY,I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
43541,L274583,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I said: I found a room.
43542,L274582,u1308,m87,LARRY,What did you say?
43543,L274581,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I found a room.
43544,L274580,u1308,m87,LARRY,Where are you?
43545,L274579,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I got through.
43546,L274578,u1308,m87,LARRY,Kirsty?
43547,L274577,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Daddy?
43548,L274576,u1308,m87,LARRY,Who's there?
43549,L275179,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,'Bye.
43550,L275178,u1311,m87,STEVE,'Bye.
43551,L275177,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Sure. Why not?
43552,L275176,u1311,m87,STEVE,"I'll come back later, huh?"
43553,L275175,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"Will you GO, damn you?"
43554,L275174,u1311,m87,STEVE,What did I say?
43555,L275173,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
43556,L275172,u1311,m87,STEVE,What?
43557,L275169,u1311,m87,STEVE,I won't let anybody take you.
43558,L275168,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"Don't let them take me, Steve --"
43559,L275167,u1311,m87,STEVE,What's wrong?
43560,L275164,u1311,m87,STEVE,What things?
43561,L275163,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,These THINGS... they want to take me --
43562,L275162,u1311,m87,STEVE,What happened to you?
43563,L275161,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Steve. Thank God you came.
43564,L274847,u1311,m87,STEVE,It's a fetish of mine.
43565,L274846,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
43566,L274845,u1311,m87,STEVE,Can I lend you a hand?
43567,L274844,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Just trying to get my apartment in order.
43568,L274843,u1311,m87,STEVE,Are you busy after work ?
43569,L274842,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"No, it's good to see you."
43570,L274841,u1311,m87,STEVE,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you."
43571,L274840,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,If I make it through the day.
43572,L274839,u1311,m87,STEVE,Your father told me you were working here.
43573,L274838,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I've been better.
43574,L274837,u1311,m87,STEVE,Are you alright ?
43575,L274836,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Oh!
43576,L274820,u1311,m87,STEVE,Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
43577,L274819,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,It's not what I heard.
43578,L274818,u1311,m87,STEVE,Oh no.
43579,L274817,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Oh no?
43580,L274816,u1311,m87,STEVE,We're not all frigid.
43581,L274815,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
43582,L274814,u1311,m87,STEVE,I beg your pardon?
43583,L274813,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid."
43584,L274812,u1311,m87,STEVE,Meaning what?
43585,L274811,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,She's so damn... English.
43586,L274810,u1311,m87,STEVE,I see.
43587,L274809,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,"Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia."
43588,L274808,u1311,m87,STEVE,Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
43589,L274807,u1311,m87,STEVE,We walk.
43590,L274806,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,What do we do if there isn't?
43591,L274805,u1311,m87,STEVE,If there's a train.
43592,L274804,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,All right.  No. That's nice.
43593,L274803,u1311,m87,STEVE,Please. I want to see you home. All right?
43594,L274802,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Not that late.
43595,L274801,u1311,m87,STEVE,It's late.
43596,L274800,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,You know I do know the way home.
43597,L274799,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I'm coming!  Sleep well.
43598,L274798,u1311,m87,STEVE,I thought we'd lost you.
43599,L274797,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I'm here.
43600,L274784,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I AM house-trained.
43601,L274783,u1311,m87,STEVE,Need any help?
43602,L274782,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,Just upstairs.
43603,L274781,u1311,m87,STEVE,You're not going?
43604,L274752,u1311,m87,STEVE,So lie down.
43605,L274751,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,I won't be able to stand.
43606,L274749,u1307,m87,KIRSTY,That's right. Cointreau.
43607,L274748,u1311,m87,STEVE,We're on the Cointreau.
43608,L279684,u1323,m88,ROB,"Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me."
43609,L279683,u1312,m88,ALISON'S MOM,I beg your pardon?
43610,L279682,u1323,m88,ROB,"Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate."
43611,L279681,u1312,m88,ALISON'S MOM,That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
43612,L279680,u1323,m88,ROB,You gotta be kidding me.
43613,L279679,u1312,m88,ALISON'S MOM,"I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister."
43614,L279678,u1323,m88,ROB,Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
43615,L279677,u1323,m88,ROB,Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
43616,L279676,u1312,m88,ALISON'S MOM,Really.
43617,L279675,u1323,m88,ROB,Alison's.
43618,L279673,u1312,m88,ALISON'S MOM,I don't know.
43619,L279672,u1323,m88,ROB,Do I know you?
43620,L280038,u1313,m88,BARRY,"That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready."
43621,L280037,u1323,m88,ROB,You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
43622,L280036,u1313,m88,BARRY,"I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact."
43623,L280035,u1323,m88,ROB,"Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey."
43624,L280034,u1313,m88,BARRY,What do you think?  Dick likes it.
43625,L280033,u1323,m88,ROB,Sonic Death Monkey.
43626,L280032,u1313,m88,BARRY,"We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey."
43627,L280031,u1323,m88,ROB,"You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?"
43628,L280030,u1313,m88,BARRY,"We're not as bad as you think, Rob."
43629,L280029,u1323,m88,ROB,110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
43630,L280028,u1313,m88,BARRY,No.  We need the gig.
43631,L280027,u1323,m88,ROB,"What is she doing?  Okay, 20%."
43632,L280026,u1313,m88,BARRY,We're getting that anyway.
43633,L280025,u1323,m88,ROB,I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
43634,L280024,u1313,m88,BARRY,Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
43635,L280023,u1323,m88,ROB,Like fuck you are.
43636,L279983,u1313,m88,BARRY,"HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?"
43637,L279982,u1323,m88,ROB,So?  You even said they're good.
43638,L279981,u1313,m88,BARRY,"I heard you, man.  Don't give me that ""what"" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them."
43639,L279980,u1323,m88,ROB,What?
43640,L279979,u1313,m88,BARRY,What the fuck is that?
43641,L279964,u1313,m88,BARRY,Yes way.  It's really...
43642,L279963,u1323,m88,ROB,No way.
43643,L279962,u1313,m88,BARRY,The little skate-fuckers.
43644,L279835,u1323,m88,ROB,Not really.
43645,L279834,u1313,m88,BARRY,Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
43646,L279833,u1323,m88,ROB,Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
43647,L279832,u1313,m88,BARRY,Haven't seen it.
43648,L279831,u1323,m88,ROB,Because it's in The Big Chill.
43649,L279830,u1313,m88,BARRY,"I'd want ""One Step Beyond"" by Madness. And ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."""
43650,L279829,u1323,m88,ROB,"Fuck off, Barry."
43651,L279828,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Whatever.  Okay. ""Tell Laura I Love Her."" That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it."
43652,L279827,u1323,m88,ROB,"It was Jan, and it was a long time after--"
43653,L279820,u1313,m88,BARRY,Ooh.  Drag.
43654,L279819,u1323,m88,ROB,Laura.  Her dad died.
43655,L279818,u1313,m88,BARRY,What's up?
43656,L279768,u1323,m88,ROB,"Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window."
43657,L279767,u1313,m88,BARRY,"So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?"
43658,L279766,u1323,m88,ROB,Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
43659,L279765,u1313,m88,BARRY,You're not even coming?
43660,L279764,u1323,m88,ROB,None.  Christ!
43661,L279763,u1313,m88,BARRY,How many tickets can I put you down for?
43662,L279762,u1323,m88,ROB,Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
43663,L279761,u1313,m88,BARRY,"That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --"
43664,L279760,u1323,m88,ROB,Isn't it?
43665,L279759,u1323,m88,ROB,"That's why you got the gig, isn't it?"
43666,L279758,u1313,m88,BARRY,"They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea."
43667,L279757,u1323,m88,ROB,You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
43668,L279756,u1313,m88,BARRY,I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
43669,L279755,u1323,m88,ROB,Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
43670,L279754,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it."
43671,L279753,u1323,m88,ROB,"You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters."
43672,L279752,u1313,m88,BARRY,The band that found me and asked me to join.
43673,L279751,u1323,m88,ROB,What band?
43674,L279750,u1313,m88,BARRY,My band.
43675,L279749,u1323,m88,ROB,What the fuck is that?
43676,L279748,u1313,m88,BARRY,Hey.
43677,L279617,u1323,m88,ROB,Terrific.
43678,L279616,u1313,m88,BARRY,Suck my ass.
43679,L279615,u1323,m88,ROB,"Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday."
43680,L279614,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some."
43681,L279613,u1323,m88,ROB,"Shut the fuck up, Barry."
43682,L279608,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?"
43683,L279607,u1323,m88,ROB,How do you know about that?
43684,L279606,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all."
43685,L279600,u1323,m88,ROB,Ha.
43686,L279599,u1313,m88,BARRY,Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
43687,L279598,u1323,m88,ROB,Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
43688,L279597,u1313,m88,BARRY,"I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?"
43689,L279596,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass."
43690,L279595,u1323,m88,ROB,Why would they care?
43691,L279594,u1313,m88,BARRY,How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
43692,L279593,u1323,m88,ROB,"But in your opinion, would I definitely go?"
43693,L279592,u1313,m88,BARRY,"...But the word ""yet..."" Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to."
43694,L279591,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone..."
43695,L279590,u1323,m88,ROB,Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
43696,L279589,u1313,m88,BARRY,"""-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,"" yeah, yeah, I hear you --"
43697,L279588,u1323,m88,ROB,Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
43698,L279587,u1313,m88,BARRY,"I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?"
43699,L279586,u1323,m88,ROB,"No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?"
43700,L279585,u1313,m88,BARRY,I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
43701,L279584,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, ""I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,"" what would you think?"
43702,L279583,u1313,m88,BARRY,"To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century."
43703,L279582,u1323,m88,ROB,"Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? ""I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"""
43704,L279581,u1323,m88,ROB,"-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?"
43705,L279580,u1313,m88,BARRY,"-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --"
43706,L279579,u1323,m88,ROB,"There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does ""yet"" mean, anyway?  ""I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet."" What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?"
43707,L279569,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! ""Let's Get It On?"" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?"
43708,L279568,u1323,m88,ROB,"Shut up. ""Let's Get It On,"" Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. ""Airbag,"" Radiohead, from OK Computer."
43709,L279567,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?"
43710,L279566,u1323,m88,ROB,"""Thunder Road,"" Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" Nirvana, Nevermind."
43711,L279565,u1313,m88,BARRY,Ehh.
43712,L279564,u1323,m88,ROB,"Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... ""Janie Jones,"" the Clash, from The Clash."
43713,L279420,u1313,m88,BARRY,What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
43714,L279419,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
43715,L279418,u1313,m88,BARRY,What are you snickering about?
43716,L279417,u1323,m88,ROB,"What do you mean, ""what?"""
43717,L279416,u1313,m88,BARRY,What?
43718,L279317,u1323,m88,ROB,"It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great."
43719,L279316,u1313,m88,BARRY,We can take your car.
43720,L279315,u1323,m88,ROB,"That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!"
43721,L279314,u1313,m88,BARRY,"We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us."
43722,L279293,u1313,m88,BARRY,"I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy."
43723,L279292,u1323,m88,ROB,What did you tell her about the shop for?
43724,L279270,u1313,m88,BARRY,...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
43725,L279269,u1323,m88,ROB,"I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes."
43726,L279268,u1313,m88,BARRY,I wanna date a musician...
43727,L279261,u1323,m88,ROB,But now I kind of like it.
43728,L279260,u1313,m88,BARRY,Yeah.
43729,L279194,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?"
43730,L279193,u1323,m88,ROB,It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
43731,L279192,u1313,m88,BARRY,He offended me with his terrible taste.
43732,L279191,u1323,m88,ROB,What did he ever do to you?
43733,L279190,u1313,m88,BARRY,Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
43734,L279189,u1323,m88,ROB,"Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop."
43735,L279188,u1313,m88,BARRY,"""Our customers?"" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?"
43736,L279187,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
43737,L279186,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Oh, so what's the point then?"
43738,L279185,u1323,m88,ROB,Not the point.
43739,L279184,u1313,m88,BARRY,"We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is ""Don't Drive Drunk."" I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny."
43740,L279183,u1323,m88,ROB,"You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry."
43741,L279182,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  ""Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"""
43742,L279181,u1323,m88,ROB,"Nice, Barry."
43743,L279160,u1313,m88,BARRY,Well what's the point in that?
43744,L279159,u1323,m88,ROB,We'll do it next Monday.
43745,L279158,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it."
43746,L279157,u1323,m88,ROB,Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
43747,L279156,u1313,m88,BARRY,Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
43748,L279155,u1323,m88,ROB,How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
43749,L279146,u1313,m88,BARRY,"""Little Latin Lupe Lu."""
43750,L279145,u1323,m88,ROB,Say it.
43751,L279144,u1313,m88,BARRY,Play it.
43752,L279143,u1323,m88,ROB,What's next?
43753,L279142,u1313,m88,BARRY,Don't you want to hear what's next?
43754,L279141,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier."
43755,L279140,u1313,m88,BARRY,But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
43756,L279139,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
43757,L279138,u1313,m88,BARRY,Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
43758,L279137,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
43759,L279136,u1313,m88,BARRY,What are you doing?
43760,L279135,u1313,m88,BARRY,IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
43761,L279134,u1323,m88,ROB,"TURN IT OFF, BARRY."
43762,L279388,u1313,m88,BARRY,NO--!
43763,L279387,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,I have a television.
43764,L279386,u1313,m88,BARRY,That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
43765,L279378,u1313,m88,BARRY,Do not get ahead of yourself.
43766,L279377,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,Well what about the new Echo --
43767,L279376,u1313,m88,BARRY,"They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane."
43768,L279375,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,They always seemed...
43769,L279374,u1313,m88,BARRY,Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
43770,L279373,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,I have all of the others.
43771,L279372,u1313,m88,BARRY,"It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --"
43772,L279177,u1313,m88,BARRY,Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
43773,L279176,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
43774,L279175,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells ""I Just Called To Say I Loved You?"" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time."
43775,L279174,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,Why not?
43776,L279173,u1313,m88,BARRY,"No, you can't."
43777,L279172,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,Great.  Can I have it then?
43778,L279171,u1313,m88,BARRY,Oh yeah.  We got it.
43779,L279170,u1316,m88,CUSTOMER,"I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  ""I Just Called To Say I Love You."" Do you have it?"
43780,L279826,u1313,m88,BARRY,"-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot."
43781,L279825,u1317,m88,DICK,"Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --"
43782,L279824,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Okay, okay -- ""Leader of the Pack."" The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? ""Dead Man's Curve,"" Jan and Dean..."
43783,L279722,u1313,m88,BARRY,He's not worth it!
43784,L279721,u1317,m88,DICK,"Don't do it, Rob!"
43785,L279612,u1313,m88,BARRY,Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
43786,L279611,u1317,m88,DICK,Anna Moss.
43787,L279610,u1313,m88,BARRY,Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
43788,L279609,u1317,m88,DICK,Anna.
43789,L279604,u1317,m88,DICK,Nobody.
43790,L279603,u1313,m88,BARRY,Who are you going to see?
43791,L279602,u1313,m88,BARRY,Why?
43792,L279601,u1317,m88,DICK,"I can't go to the club tonight, guys."
43793,L279288,u1317,m88,DICK,You'd love it!
43794,L279287,u1313,m88,BARRY,We work there!
43795,L279286,u1317,m88,DICK,A couple blocks!  About six!
43796,L279285,u1313,m88,BARRY,On Clark Street!
43797,L279284,u1317,m88,DICK,He's got one!
43798,L279267,u1313,m88,BARRY,You can be and are wrong.
43799,L279266,u1317,m88,DICK,"It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a ""The.""  But I could be wrong."
43800,L279265,u1313,m88,BARRY,"No, no, no, you said ""The Number Four With a Smile,"" and there's no ""The"" at the front of the title of the album."
43801,L279264,u1317,m88,DICK,That's what I said.
43802,L279263,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Isn't her album called ""Number Four With A Smile?"""
43803,L279262,u1317,m88,DICK,"She shouldn't done it on ""The Number Four With a Smile."""
43804,L279154,u1313,m88,BARRY,Bullshit.
43805,L279153,u1317,m88,DICK,Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
43806,L279152,u1313,m88,BARRY,"No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?"
43807,L279151,u1317,m88,DICK,Nothing.
43808,L279150,u1313,m88,BARRY,What?
43809,L279149,u1317,m88,DICK,Oh well.  Nevermind.
43810,L279148,u1313,m88,BARRY,No.  The Righteous Brothers.
43811,L279147,u1317,m88,DICK,Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
43812,L279130,u1317,m88,DICK,It's the new --
43813,L279129,u1313,m88,BARRY,Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
43814,L279989,u1313,m88,BARRY,Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
43815,L279988,u1319,m88,LAURA,What are you talking about?
43816,L279987,u1313,m88,BARRY,The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
43817,L279986,u1319,m88,LAURA,Where's Rob?
43818,L279985,u1313,m88,BARRY,"Oh, hi."
43819,L279984,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Hey, Barry."
43820,L279844,u1319,m88,LAURA,No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
43821,L279843,u1313,m88,BARRY,"""Somebody's Gonna Die"" by Blitz. ""Bella Lugosi's Dead,"" Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling."
43822,L280091,u1323,m88,ROB,Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
43823,L280090,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
43824,L280089,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?"
43825,L280088,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
43826,L280087,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them."
43827,L280086,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,"Okay. ""Dance Music For Old People?"""
43828,L280085,u1323,m88,ROB,"Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like ""the Upsetter"" by Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, in there.  Instead of ""Sin City."""
43829,L280084,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,"""Music for Old People."" What does that mean?"
43830,L280083,u1323,m88,ROB,Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
43831,L280082,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,What's his name?
43832,L280081,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah.
43833,L280080,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,Nice friend.
43834,L280079,u1323,m88,ROB,"Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --"
43835,L280078,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
43836,L280077,u1323,m88,ROB,"Sure, but is that it for the list?"
43837,L280076,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,"Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time."
43838,L280075,u1323,m88,ROB,Is that it?
43839,L280074,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,Fine.  That's great.
43840,L280073,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... ""Sin City."" ""New Rose,"" by The Damned. ""Hit It and Quit It"" by Funkadelic. ""Shipbuilding,"" Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... ""Mystery Train"" by Elvis Presley... And... ""Spaced Cowboy"" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but..."
43841,L280072,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,"Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger."
43842,L280071,u1323,m88,ROB,Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
43843,L280070,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,"Well if one of them is this ""Sin City"" thing --"
43844,L280069,u1323,m88,ROB,"What do you mean, four more?"
43845,L280068,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
43846,L280067,u1323,m88,ROB,"OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. ""Sin City"" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home."
43847,L280066,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,Is there a difference?
43848,L280065,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh boy... In the club, or at home?"
43849,L280064,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,Your desert island top-five.
43850,L280063,u1323,m88,ROB,Pardon me?
43851,L280062,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,"Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?"
43852,L280061,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
43853,L280060,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
43854,L280059,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,So.  Is now a good time?
43855,L280058,u1323,m88,ROB,"What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right."
43856,L280057,u1323,m88,ROB,Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
43857,L280056,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
43858,L280055,u1323,m88,ROB,Oh.  Okay.
43859,L280054,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,"Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now."
43860,L280053,u1323,m88,ROB,Right.  Why?
43861,L280052,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
43862,L280051,u1323,m88,ROB,Uh.  That's me.
43863,L280050,u1314,m88,CAROLINE,I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
43864,L280049,u1323,m88,ROB,May I help you?
43865,L279746,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,"Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings."
43866,L279745,u1323,m88,ROB,Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
43867,L279744,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,"It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation."
43868,L279743,u1323,m88,ROB,"C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?"
43869,L279742,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,"There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?"
43870,L279741,u1323,m88,ROB,Huh?
43871,L279740,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
43872,L279739,u1323,m88,ROB,Why did you break up with me for Marco?
43873,L279738,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,Hey Rob.
43874,L279737,u1323,m88,ROB,Hey Charlie.
43875,L279736,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
43876,L279735,u1323,m88,ROB,"Uh...yes, at the moment."
43877,L279734,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
43878,L279733,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
43879,L279732,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
43880,L279731,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah, sure..."
43881,L279730,u1315,m88,CHARLIE,"Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets."
43882,L279961,u1323,m88,ROB,Who's that?
43883,L279960,u1317,m88,DICK,It's Vince and Justin.
43884,L279959,u1323,m88,ROB,What is this.
43885,L279842,u1317,m88,DICK,"""Abraham, Martin, and John."" That's a nice one."
43886,L279841,u1323,m88,ROB,Can I do anything?
43887,L279822,u1323,m88,ROB,"You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it."
43888,L279821,u1317,m88,DICK,"I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --"
43889,L279619,u1317,m88,DICK,"Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob."
43890,L279618,u1323,m88,ROB,"Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole."
43891,L279422,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage."
43892,L279421,u1317,m88,DICK,Well we rang $900 today.
43893,L279390,u1317,m88,DICK,Do it.  Do it.
43894,L279389,u1323,m88,ROB,I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
43895,L279313,u1323,m88,ROB,-- FUCK OFF!
43896,L279312,u1317,m88,DICK,Rob --!
43897,L279305,u1317,m88,DICK,"Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!"
43898,L279304,u1323,m88,ROB,"Liz, hold on a second --  What?"
43899,L279303,u1317,m88,DICK,Rob.
43900,L279275,u1317,m88,DICK,I want a tape.
43901,L279274,u1323,m88,ROB,Let's not.
43902,L279259,u1317,m88,DICK,Yeah.
43903,L279258,u1323,m88,ROB,I always hated this song.
43904,L279206,u1317,m88,DICK,"Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?"
43905,L279205,u1323,m88,ROB,"I understand, Dick."
43906,L279204,u1317,m88,DICK,"Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --"
43907,L279203,u1317,m88,DICK,"I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing."
43908,L279202,u1323,m88,ROB,Fine.
43909,L279201,u1317,m88,DICK,"I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff."
43910,L279200,u1317,m88,DICK,"'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him."
43911,L279199,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that."
43912,L279198,u1317,m88,DICK,Are you all right?
43913,L279162,u1317,m88,DICK,Can I help you?
43914,L279161,u1323,m88,ROB,Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
43915,L279127,u1317,m88,DICK,The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
43916,L279126,u1323,m88,ROB,What's this?
43917,L279125,u1323,m88,ROB,Okay.
43918,L279124,u1317,m88,DICK,"Well, I'll just make it for you."
43919,L279123,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one."
43920,L279122,u1317,m88,DICK,"'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though."
43921,L279121,u1323,m88,ROB,"No, that's okay.  Really."
43922,L279120,u1317,m88,DICK,I'll tape it for you.
43923,L279119,u1323,m88,ROB,Great.
43924,L279118,u1317,m88,DICK,"Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only."
43925,L279117,u1323,m88,ROB,Good weekend?
43926,L279116,u1317,m88,DICK,"Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob."
43927,L279115,u1323,m88,ROB,"'Morning, Dick."
43928,L279669,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink."
43929,L279668,u1318,m88,IAN,"Conflict resolution is my job, Laura."
43930,L279667,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea."
43931,L279666,u1318,m88,IAN,Maybe I should talk to him.
43932,L279665,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I'm upset, but I'm fine."
43933,L279664,u1318,m88,IAN,You look upset.
43934,L279663,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone."
43935,L279661,u1319,m88,LAURA,I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
43936,L279660,u1318,m88,IAN,Laura?  Are you okay?
43937,L279726,u1318,m88,IAN,"Think about it, Rob."
43938,L279725,u1323,m88,ROB,I dunno.
43939,L279724,u1318,m88,IAN,So shall we leave it at that then?
43940,L279720,u1323,m88,ROB,"We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever."
43941,L279719,u1318,m88,IAN,Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
43942,L279718,u1323,m88,ROB,"I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store."
43943,L279717,u1318,m88,IAN,Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
43944,L279716,u1318,m88,IAN,"Think about it, Rob."
43945,L279715,u1323,m88,ROB,I dunno.
43946,L279714,u1318,m88,IAN,Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
43947,L279713,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah.
43948,L279712,u1318,m88,IAN,"We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?"
43949,L279711,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now."
43950,L279710,u1318,m88,IAN,"We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house..."
43951,L279709,u1323,m88,ROB,Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
43952,L279708,u1318,m88,IAN,"Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal."
43953,L279707,u1323,m88,ROB,What needs sorting out?
43954,L279705,u1318,m88,IAN,"Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian."
43955,L279704,u1323,m88,ROB,Can I help you?
43956,L280133,u1319,m88,LAURA,It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
43957,L280132,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
43958,L280129,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Well, you've asked."
43959,L280128,u1323,m88,ROB,"I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing."
43960,L280127,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?"
43961,L280126,u1323,m88,ROB,Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
43962,L280125,u1319,m88,LAURA,I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
43963,L280124,u1323,m88,ROB,This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
43964,L280123,u1319,m88,LAURA,About what?
43965,L280122,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
43966,L280121,u1319,m88,LAURA,So?
43967,L280120,u1323,m88,ROB,Fair enough.
43968,L280119,u1319,m88,LAURA,No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
43969,L280118,u1323,m88,ROB,Are you persuadable?
43970,L280117,u1319,m88,LAURA,Very persuasive.
43971,L280116,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't know.
43972,L280115,u1319,m88,LAURA,Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
43973,L280114,u1323,m88,ROB,"Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?"
43974,L280113,u1319,m88,LAURA,No.  Probably not.
43975,L280112,u1323,m88,ROB,Would you marry me if I was?
43976,L280111,u1319,m88,LAURA,Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
43977,L280110,u1323,m88,ROB,"Not in love, exactly, but..."
43978,L280109,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?"
43979,L280108,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch."
43980,L280107,u1319,m88,LAURA,I know.
43981,L280106,u1323,m88,ROB,I mean it.
43982,L280105,u1319,m88,LAURA,Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
43983,L280104,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
43984,L280103,u1319,m88,LAURA,What are you going to talk to me about?
43985,L280102,u1319,m88,LAURA,Right.
43986,L280101,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm going to talk to you.
43987,L280100,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?"
43988,L280099,u1323,m88,ROB,Not really.
43989,L280098,u1319,m88,LAURA,Are you worried about tomorrow night?
43990,L280046,u1323,m88,ROB,I know.  I don't get it.
43991,L280045,u1319,m88,LAURA,"That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though."
43992,L280044,u1323,m88,ROB,"I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't."
43993,L280041,u1319,m88,LAURA,We took care of that.
43994,L280040,u1323,m88,ROB,"It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --"
43995,L280039,u1319,m88,LAURA,They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
43996,L280022,u1319,m88,LAURA,Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
43997,L280021,u1323,m88,ROB,Barry?  Barry knows about this?
43998,L280020,u1319,m88,LAURA,Barry said its done.
43999,L280019,u1323,m88,ROB,"That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?"
44000,L280018,u1319,m88,LAURA,What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
44001,L280017,u1323,m88,ROB,You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
44002,L280016,u1319,m88,LAURA,I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
44003,L280015,u1323,m88,ROB,"And the ""triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?"" ""Triumphant?"" ""Return?"""
44004,L280014,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Just local, of course."
44005,L280013,u1323,m88,ROB,WHAT?
44006,L280012,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, ""would be a highly anticipated event, locally."" He helped me put out a press release."
44007,L280011,u1323,m88,ROB,"Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?"
44008,L280010,u1319,m88,LAURA,I called Dan Koretzky because he --
44009,L280009,u1319,m88,LAURA,I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
44010,L280008,u1323,m88,ROB,You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
44011,L279998,u1323,m88,ROB,Ha.
44012,L279997,u1319,m88,LAURA,I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
44013,L279996,u1323,m88,ROB,Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
44014,L279995,u1319,m88,LAURA,At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
44015,L279994,u1323,m88,ROB,Where?
44016,L279993,u1319,m88,LAURA,Wanna go to dinner?
44017,L279992,u1323,m88,ROB,Nothing.
44018,L279991,u1319,m88,LAURA,Hi.  What are you doing?
44019,L279990,u1323,m88,ROB,Hi.
44020,L279958,u1323,m88,ROB,No use.
44021,L279957,u1319,m88,LAURA,"All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?"
44022,L279956,u1319,m88,LAURA,How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
44023,L279955,u1323,m88,ROB,You're being stupid.
44024,L279954,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?"
44025,L279953,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm alright.
44026,L279952,u1319,m88,LAURA,Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
44027,L279951,u1323,m88,ROB,Harder.
44028,L279950,u1319,m88,LAURA,"More confident, maybe."
44029,L279949,u1323,m88,ROB,You're tougher.
44030,L279948,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so."
44031,L279947,u1323,m88,ROB,And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
44032,L279946,u1319,m88,LAURA,"You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs."
44033,L279945,u1323,m88,ROB,But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
44034,L279944,u1319,m88,LAURA,But what?
44035,L279943,u1323,m88,ROB,"No, but..."
44036,L279942,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience."
44037,L279941,u1323,m88,ROB,"Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't."
44038,L279940,u1319,m88,LAURA,How?  How were we the same people?
44039,L279939,u1323,m88,ROB,"But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and..."
44040,L279938,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like."
44041,L279937,u1323,m88,ROB,Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
44042,L279936,u1319,m88,LAURA,I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
44043,L279935,u1323,m88,ROB,"Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way."
44044,L279934,u1319,m88,LAURA,"... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even."
44045,L279932,u1323,m88,ROB,Okay.
44046,L279931,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?"
44047,L279930,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, great..."
44048,L279929,u1319,m88,LAURA,To make you feel better.
44049,L279928,u1323,m88,ROB,"Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?"
44050,L279927,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying."
44051,L279926,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better."
44052,L279925,u1323,m88,ROB,"Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?"
44053,L279924,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that."
44054,L279923,u1323,m88,ROB,You know the difference.
44055,L279922,u1319,m88,LAURA,What's the difference?
44056,L279921,u1323,m88,ROB,Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
44057,L279920,u1319,m88,LAURA,It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
44058,L279919,u1323,m88,ROB,What it was like.
44059,L279918,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Want to know what, exactly?"
44060,L279917,u1323,m88,ROB,C'mon.  I want to know.
44061,L279915,u1323,m88,ROB,Okay.
44062,L279914,u1319,m88,LAURA,Let's go home.  Okay?
44063,L279913,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so..."
44064,L279912,u1323,m88,ROB,Mission accomplished.
44065,L279911,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart."
44066,L279910,u1323,m88,ROB,What about Ian?
44067,L279909,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't."
44068,L279908,u1323,m88,ROB,"So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together."
44069,L279907,u1319,m88,LAURA,I'm too tired not to go out with you.
44070,L279906,u1323,m88,ROB,Laura...
44071,L279904,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?"
44072,L279903,u1323,m88,ROB,"Look, we can do other things."
44073,L279902,u1323,m88,ROB,I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
44074,L279901,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about."
44075,L279900,u1323,m88,ROB,"No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?"
44076,L279899,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again."
44077,L279898,u1323,m88,ROB,"You know, with Ray..."
44078,L279897,u1319,m88,LAURA,I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
44079,L279896,u1323,m88,ROB,Hi.
44080,L279895,u1319,m88,LAURA,Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
44081,L279894,u1319,m88,LAURA,"It'll have to be sex, then."
44082,L279893,u1323,m88,ROB,I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
44083,L279892,u1319,m88,LAURA,I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
44084,L279891,u1323,m88,ROB,What?
44085,L279890,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?"
44086,L279889,u1323,m88,ROB,When are you going back?
44087,L279888,u1319,m88,LAURA,C'mon.
44088,L279887,u1323,m88,ROB,What do you want to do?
44089,L279886,u1319,m88,LAURA,I don't want to go back.
44090,L279885,u1323,m88,ROB,"Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus."
44091,L279884,u1319,m88,LAURA,I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
44092,L279883,u1323,m88,ROB,What do you mean?
44093,L279882,u1319,m88,LAURA,Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
44094,L279881,u1323,m88,ROB,"I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all."
44095,L279880,u1319,m88,LAURA,You're also an idiot.
44096,L279879,u1323,m88,ROB,Mmnn.
44097,L279878,u1319,m88,LAURA,You're soaking.
44098,L279877,u1323,m88,ROB,Uh... No.
44099,L279876,u1319,m88,LAURA,Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
44100,L279852,u1323,m88,ROB,Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
44101,L279851,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do."
44102,L279850,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yes, of course."
44103,L279849,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Look, are you coming or not?"
44104,L279848,u1319,m88,LAURA,I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
44105,L279847,u1323,m88,ROB,Do you want me to be there?
44106,L279846,u1319,m88,LAURA,"My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to."
44107,L279845,u1323,m88,ROB,Me?
44108,L279839,u1319,m88,LAURA,In a minute.  When I get it together.
44109,L279838,u1323,m88,ROB,"No, no.  When are you going home?"
44110,L279837,u1319,m88,LAURA,I'm sorry.
44111,L279817,u1319,m88,LAURA,"My dad died.  My dad, my dad."
44112,L279816,u1323,m88,ROB,Who the fuck's Pig?
44113,L279815,u1319,m88,LAURA,Pig died.
44114,L279814,u1323,m88,ROB,Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
44115,L279813,u1319,m88,LAURA,Pigsty.
44116,L279812,u1323,m88,ROB,Are you alright?
44117,L279811,u1323,m88,ROB,"God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed."
44118,L279810,u1319,m88,LAURA,I can't talk right now.
44119,L279809,u1323,m88,ROB,"Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?"
44120,L279808,u1323,m88,ROB,"Hey, how ya doin'?"
44121,L279807,u1319,m88,LAURA,Hello.
44122,L279804,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Well, think about it."
44123,L279803,u1323,m88,ROB,I guess I am.
44124,L279802,u1319,m88,LAURA,You're being deliberately obtuse.
44125,L279801,u1323,m88,ROB,"I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him."
44126,L279800,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it."
44127,L279799,u1323,m88,ROB,"Okay, okay.  I get the picture."
44128,L279798,u1319,m88,LAURA,"They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I..."
44129,L279797,u1323,m88,ROB,Sure they are.
44130,L279796,u1319,m88,LAURA,Those aren't mine.
44131,L279795,u1323,m88,ROB,Don't forget your CDs.
44132,L279792,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Oh ho, so very infrequently."
44133,L279791,u1323,m88,ROB,You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
44134,L279790,u1319,m88,LAURA,Mmm hmm.
44135,L279789,u1323,m88,ROB,You know I'm a good person.
44136,L279788,u1319,m88,LAURA,"You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about."
44137,L279787,u1323,m88,ROB,"This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways."
44138,L279786,u1323,m88,ROB,"I hate him too.  So I just call him ""Mavis."" Or ""Sissyboy."" Or ""Mavis the Sissyboy."""
44139,L279785,u1319,m88,LAURA,Ray.  I hate Ian.
44140,L279784,u1323,m88,ROB,"I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?"
44141,L279783,u1319,m88,LAURA,You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
44142,L279782,u1323,m88,ROB,"I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place."
44143,L279781,u1319,m88,LAURA,Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
44144,L279779,u1319,m88,LAURA,You know what I mean.
44145,L279778,u1323,m88,ROB,"That bad, eh?"
44146,L279777,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest."
44147,L279776,u1323,m88,ROB,You still together?  Going all right?
44148,L279775,u1319,m88,LAURA,I'm sure.
44149,L279774,u1323,m88,ROB,It was kind of funny.
44150,L279773,u1319,m88,LAURA,"He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so."
44151,L279772,u1323,m88,ROB,Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
44152,L279771,u1319,m88,LAURA,Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
44153,L279770,u1323,m88,ROB,Is that the last of it?
44154,L279769,u1319,m88,LAURA,I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
44155,L279659,u1323,m88,ROB,"No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it."
44156,L279658,u1319,m88,LAURA,You don't ever think about other people?
44157,L279657,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
44158,L279656,u1319,m88,LAURA,I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
44159,L279655,u1323,m88,ROB,"Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --"
44160,L279654,u1319,m88,LAURA,Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
44161,L279653,u1323,m88,ROB,Are you still in love with me?
44162,L279651,u1319,m88,LAURA,I'm not -- hold on...
44163,L279650,u1323,m88,ROB,"I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing ""Doctor Who""-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him."
44164,L279649,u1319,m88,LAURA,I figured it was.  Where are you?
44165,L279648,u1323,m88,ROB,It's me.
44166,L279647,u1319,m88,LAURA,Hello.
44167,L279642,u1323,m88,ROB,"You do, huh."
44168,L279641,u1319,m88,LAURA,Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
44169,L279640,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't have your number.
44170,L279639,u1319,m88,LAURA,Will you call me?
44171,L279638,u1323,m88,ROB,"Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know."
44172,L279637,u1319,m88,LAURA,We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
44173,L279636,u1323,m88,ROB,Nothing.
44174,L279635,u1319,m88,LAURA,"And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?"
44175,L279634,u1319,m88,LAURA,"You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime."
44176,L279633,u1323,m88,ROB,"You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? ""Motel Matches?"" ""I Want You?"" ""I Hope You're Happy Now?"" ""Green Shirt?"" His records should be sealed in cases that say ""in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass."" ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night,"" sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing."
44177,L279630,u1323,m88,ROB,"I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth."
44178,L279629,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?"
44179,L279628,u1323,m88,ROB,I guess.
44180,L279627,u1319,m88,LAURA,Is that why you wanted to see me?
44181,L279626,u1323,m88,ROB,"No, not -- I mean have you, you know --"
44182,L279625,u1319,m88,LAURA,I told you I slept with him.
44183,L279624,u1323,m88,ROB,Have you slept with him yet?
44184,L279623,u1319,m88,LAURA,"So, how are you?"
44185,L279577,u1323,m88,ROB,Great... That's great.
44186,L279576,u1319,m88,LAURA,We'll talk some other time.
44187,L279575,u1323,m88,ROB,"Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk."
44188,L279574,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff..."
44189,L279573,u1323,m88,ROB,I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
44190,L279572,u1319,m88,LAURA,Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
44191,L279571,u1323,m88,ROB,Hi.
44192,L279513,u1319,m88,LAURA,Will you please just go?
44193,L279512,u1323,m88,ROB,The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
44194,L279511,u1319,m88,LAURA,"No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better."
44195,L279510,u1323,m88,ROB,"But not even before, when he was living upstairs?"
44196,L279509,u1319,m88,LAURA,I haven't felt like it.
44197,L279508,u1323,m88,ROB,Never?
44198,L279507,u1319,m88,LAURA,Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
44199,L279506,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't know.
44200,L279505,u1319,m88,LAURA,You really think it would make a difference either way?
44201,L279504,u1323,m88,ROB,Of course it is.
44202,L279503,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?"
44203,L279502,u1323,m88,ROB,"Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?"
44204,L279501,u1319,m88,LAURA,Is what better?  Better than what?
44205,L279500,u1323,m88,ROB,Is it better?
44206,L279499,u1319,m88,LAURA,Just ask it!
44207,L279498,u1323,m88,ROB,You won't like it.
44208,L279497,u1319,m88,LAURA,Nevermind.
44209,L279496,u1323,m88,ROB,It sounds stupid.
44210,L279495,u1319,m88,LAURA,Fine.  One.
44211,L279494,u1323,m88,ROB,No problem.  If I can ask one question.
44212,L279493,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here."
44213,L279492,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah.  Great.
44214,L279491,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?"
44215,L279490,u1323,m88,ROB,Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
44216,L279489,u1319,m88,LAURA,-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
44217,L279488,u1323,m88,ROB,"Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --"
44218,L279487,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Oh, Rob, shut up."
44219,L279486,u1323,m88,ROB,So we have a chance of getting back together again.
44220,L279485,u1319,m88,LAURA,I suppose so.
44221,L279484,u1323,m88,ROB,"Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility."
44222,L279483,u1319,m88,LAURA,I don't know.
44223,L279482,u1323,m88,ROB,"So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?"
44224,L279481,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here."
44225,L279479,u1323,m88,ROB,Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
44226,L279478,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing."
44227,L279477,u1323,m88,ROB,Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
44228,L279476,u1319,m88,LAURA,Rob.  Don't be childish.
44229,L279475,u1323,m88,ROB,No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
44230,L279474,u1319,m88,LAURA,Did you say something?
44231,L279473,u1323,m88,ROB,"What, what?"
44232,L279472,u1319,m88,LAURA,What?
44233,L279470,u1323,m88,ROB,No.
44234,L279469,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I guess it's not that obvious, then."
44235,L279468,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't know.
44236,L279467,u1319,m88,LAURA,What's the obvious stuff?
44237,L279466,u1323,m88,ROB,Just the obvious stuff.
44238,L279465,u1319,m88,LAURA,What were the others?
44239,L279464,u1323,m88,ROB,I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
44240,L279463,u1319,m88,LAURA,"What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob."
44241,L279462,u1323,m88,ROB,Good.  So.  Is it my job?
44242,L279461,u1319,m88,LAURA,"I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know."
44243,L279460,u1323,m88,ROB,"Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?"
44244,L279459,u1319,m88,LAURA,I think you know that.
44245,L279458,u1323,m88,ROB,So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
44246,L279456,u1323,m88,ROB,Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
44247,L279455,u1319,m88,LAURA,Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
44248,L279451,u1323,m88,ROB,Not really.
44249,L279450,u1319,m88,LAURA,And do you like it that way?
44250,L279449,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?"
44251,L279448,u1319,m88,LAURA,You really believe that?
44252,L279447,u1323,m88,ROB,"But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything."
44253,L279446,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?"
44254,L279445,u1323,m88,ROB,So you weren't interested in music at all?
44255,L279444,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one."
44256,L279443,u1323,m88,ROB,"You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- ""It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."""
44257,L279441,u1319,m88,LAURA,I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
44258,L279440,u1323,m88,ROB,But don't you remember?
44259,L279439,u1319,m88,LAURA,Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
44260,L279438,u1323,m88,ROB,"Hey!  Marvin Gaye! ""Got to Give It Up!"" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!"
44261,L279437,u1319,m88,LAURA,"-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?"
44262,L279436,u1323,m88,ROB,"-- Alright, alright but --"
44263,L279435,u1319,m88,LAURA,"-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --"
44264,L279434,u1323,m88,ROB,"-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --"
44265,L279433,u1319,m88,LAURA,"It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --"
44266,L279432,u1323,m88,ROB,How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
44267,L279429,u1323,m88,ROB,My house?
44268,L279428,u1319,m88,LAURA,"Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things."
44269,L279427,u1323,m88,ROB,Are you coming home?
44270,L279426,u1319,m88,LAURA,I thought I could give you a lift back.
44271,L279425,u1323,m88,ROB,Hi.
44272,L279424,u1319,m88,LAURA,Hi.
44273,L279423,u1323,m88,ROB,Shit!
44274,L279324,u1319,m88,LAURA,I should be so lucky.
44275,L279323,u1323,m88,ROB,Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
44276,L279096,u1323,m88,ROB,"Well stay for tonight, then."
44277,L279095,u1319,m88,LAURA,"We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know..."
44278,L279094,u1323,m88,ROB,You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
44279,L279874,u1320,m88,LIZ,"If by ""we"" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do."
44280,L279873,u1323,m88,ROB,"Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?"
44281,L279872,u1320,m88,LIZ,Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
44282,L279871,u1323,m88,ROB,"I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?"
44283,L279870,u1320,m88,LIZ,Enough of what?
44284,L279869,u1323,m88,ROB,"Enough, Liz."
44285,L279860,u1323,m88,ROB,Isn't that how it is for everybody?
44286,L279859,u1320,m88,LIZ,"No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story."
44287,L279858,u1323,m88,ROB,Is Ray going?
44288,L279857,u1320,m88,LIZ,What difference does it make?
44289,L279856,u1323,m88,ROB,You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
44290,L279855,u1320,m88,LIZ,It's a crematorium.
44291,L279854,u1323,m88,ROB,"So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?"
44292,L279369,u1323,m88,ROB,Well she --
44293,L279368,u1320,m88,LIZ,"Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were ""kind of looking around for somebody else!"""
44294,L279367,u1323,m88,ROB,It's true!
44295,L279366,u1320,m88,LIZ,To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
44296,L279365,u1320,m88,LIZ,"-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE."
44297,L279364,u1323,m88,ROB,"What's the -- hey, Liz --"
44298,L279302,u1320,m88,LIZ,"Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --"
44299,L279301,u1323,m88,ROB,"Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, ""you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be."" You know?"
44300,L279300,u1320,m88,LIZ,How're you holding up?
44301,L279299,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
44302,L279298,u1320,m88,LIZ,You called this morning?
44303,L279297,u1323,m88,ROB,What's happenin'.
44304,L279296,u1320,m88,LIZ,Hey.  It's Liz.
44305,L279295,u1323,m88,ROB,Rob here.
44306,L279563,u1321,m88,MARIE,Right.
44307,L279562,u1323,m88,ROB,I'll call you.
44308,L279561,u1321,m88,MARIE,And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
44309,L279560,u1323,m88,ROB,That way.
44310,L279559,u1321,m88,MARIE,That way.  You?
44311,L279558,u1323,m88,ROB,Which way are you going?
44312,L279555,u1321,m88,MARIE,"God, you ask a lot of questions."
44313,L279554,u1323,m88,ROB,Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
44314,L279552,u1321,m88,MARIE,Good.
44315,L279551,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah.
44316,L279550,u1321,m88,MARIE,So you'll stay?
44317,L279549,u1323,m88,ROB,I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
44318,L279548,u1321,m88,MARIE,"Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz."
44319,L279547,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, right.  Alright."
44320,L279546,u1321,m88,MARIE,I'd like it if you could stay the night.
44321,L279545,u1321,m88,MARIE,"When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff."
44322,L279544,u1323,m88,ROB,I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
44323,L279543,u1321,m88,MARIE,"Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket."
44324,L279542,u1323,m88,ROB,Whiskey.
44325,L279541,u1321,m88,MARIE,"Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?"
44326,L279540,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm sure it isn't.
44327,L279539,u1321,m88,MARIE,For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
44328,L279538,u1323,m88,ROB,Yes.  You?
44329,L279537,u1321,m88,MARIE,Are you okay?
44330,L279535,u1323,m88,ROB,Nor have you!
44331,L279534,u1321,m88,MARIE,You haven't even seen it!
44332,L279533,u1323,m88,ROB,Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
44333,L279532,u1321,m88,MARIE,The Conformist.
44334,L279531,u1323,m88,ROB,"Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?"
44335,L279530,u1323,m88,ROB,"Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life."
44336,L279529,u1321,m88,MARIE,"Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks."
44337,L279528,u1323,m88,ROB,"What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me."
44338,L279527,u1321,m88,MARIE,"Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --"
44339,L279526,u1323,m88,ROB,"Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like..."
44340,L279525,u1323,m88,ROB,I understand completely.
44341,L279524,u1321,m88,MARIE,No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
44342,L279523,u1323,m88,ROB,You share a place with T-Bone?
44343,L279522,u1321,m88,MARIE,Yup.
44344,L279521,u1323,m88,ROB,"Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?"
44345,L279520,u1321,m88,MARIE,Thank you.
44346,L279519,u1323,m88,ROB,It's a great song.
44347,L279518,u1321,m88,MARIE,"God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song ""Patsy Cline Times Two"" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections."
44348,L279517,u1323,m88,ROB,"She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually."
44349,L279516,u1321,m88,MARIE,Everything go alright?
44350,L279515,u1323,m88,ROB,"Hi, Marie."
44351,L279310,u1323,m88,ROB,"No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well."
44352,L279309,u1321,m88,MARIE,Don't you like that?
44353,L279281,u1321,m88,MARIE,"Yup.  Not far from here, actually."
44354,L279280,u1323,m88,ROB,So you live in Chicago now?
44355,L279279,u1323,m88,ROB,Good.
44356,L279278,u1321,m88,MARIE,Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
44357,L279253,u1322,m88,MOM,"Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes."
44358,L279252,u1323,m88,ROB,"Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now."
44359,L279251,u1322,m88,MOM,So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
44360,L279250,u1323,m88,ROB,"It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at."
44361,L279249,u1322,m88,MOM,What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
44362,L279248,u1323,m88,ROB,Then what are you getting so upset about?
44363,L279247,u1322,m88,MOM,I knew this was going to happen.
44364,L279246,u1323,m88,ROB,Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
44365,L279245,u1322,m88,MOM,And after that?
44366,L279244,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
44367,L279243,u1322,m88,MOM,I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
44368,L279242,u1323,m88,ROB,"Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?"
44369,L279241,u1322,m88,MOM,You know that's not what's upsetting me.
44370,L279240,u1323,m88,ROB,"I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you."
44371,L279239,u1323,m88,ROB,Hello?  Anybody there?
44372,L279237,u1323,m88,ROB,"She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno..."
44373,L279236,u1322,m88,MOM,Well call her mother.
44374,L279235,u1323,m88,ROB,How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
44375,L279234,u1322,m88,MOM,What do you mean?  Where did she go?
44376,L279233,u1323,m88,ROB,She left.  She's gone.
44377,L279232,u1322,m88,MOM,"Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep..."
44378,L279231,u1323,m88,ROB,So so.  Up and down.
44379,L279230,u1322,m88,MOM,How's the store?
44380,L279229,u1323,m88,ROB,Great.  Super-fantastic.
44381,L279228,u1322,m88,MOM,Everything all right?
44382,L279227,u1323,m88,ROB,"Hi, Mom."
44383,L279226,u1322,m88,MOM,"Hi, Rob.  It's your mother."
44384,L279225,u1323,m88,ROB,Yeah?
44385,L279361,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
44386,L279360,u1323,m88,ROB,"Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care."
44387,L279359,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Sure.  Ten cents.
44388,L279358,u1323,m88,ROB,Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
44389,L279357,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Fine.
44390,L279356,u1323,m88,ROB,I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
44391,L279355,u1325,m88,WOMAN,"With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want."
44392,L279354,u1325,m88,WOMAN,And I won't take a penny over ninety.
44393,L279353,u1323,m88,ROB,Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
44394,L279352,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Seventy-five.
44395,L279351,u1323,m88,ROB,Thirteen hundred.
44396,L279350,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Sixty.
44397,L279349,u1323,m88,ROB,That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
44398,L279348,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
44399,L279347,u1323,m88,ROB,Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
44400,L279346,u1325,m88,WOMAN,That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
44401,L279345,u1323,m88,ROB,Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
44402,L279344,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
44403,L279343,u1323,m88,ROB,It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
44404,L279342,u1325,m88,WOMAN,"He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall."
44405,L279341,u1323,m88,ROB,"And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?"
44406,L279340,u1325,m88,WOMAN,I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
44407,L279339,u1323,m88,ROB,But you must have --
44408,L279338,u1325,m88,WOMAN,I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
44409,L279337,u1323,m88,ROB,"These are worth at least, I don't know --"
44410,L279336,u1325,m88,WOMAN,Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
44411,L279335,u1323,m88,ROB,It's the best collection I've ever seen.
44412,L279334,u1325,m88,WOMAN,What do you think?
44413,L279977,u1324,m88,VINCE,What's the name of your label?
44414,L279976,u1323,m88,ROB,Nice.
44415,L279975,u1324,m88,VINCE,We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
44416,L279971,u1323,m88,ROB,Whatever.
44417,L279970,u1324,m88,VINCE,I'm Vince.
44418,L279969,u1323,m88,ROB,"We're not there yet, Justin."
44419,L279968,u1324,m88,VINCE,Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
44420,L279967,u1323,m88,ROB,"It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys."
44421,L279414,u1323,m88,ROB,Fuck off.
44422,L279413,u1324,m88,VINCE,"Records are those big round black things, right?"
44423,L279412,u1323,m88,ROB,"Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the ""mothers,"" as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it."
44424,L279409,u1324,m88,VINCE,"No, we..."
44425,L279408,u1323,m88,ROB,"Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free."
44426,L279407,u1323,m88,ROB,I can't frisk you but the cops can.
44427,L279406,u1324,m88,VINCE,Well we don't.
44428,L279405,u1323,m88,ROB,I think you have more.
44429,L279402,u1323,m88,ROB,Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
44430,L279401,u1324,m88,VINCE,Naw.  Those are for us.
44431,L279400,u1323,m88,ROB,"Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?"
44432,L282389,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Go to hell.
44433,L282388,u1328,m89,DENNIS,I warned you.
44434,L282065,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Sure.
44435,L282064,u1328,m89,DENNIS,"Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood..."
44436,L282063,u1328,m89,DENNIS,Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
44437,L282062,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
44438,L282061,u1328,m89,DENNIS,He'd want to know about all this.
44439,L282060,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Yeah.
44440,L282059,u1328,m89,DENNIS,"Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?"
44441,L282058,u1328,m89,DENNIS,Find the father.  That should clear things up.
44442,L282057,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30."
44443,L282056,u1328,m89,DENNIS,How old is Richard?
44444,L282055,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
44445,L282054,u1328,m89,DENNIS,Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
44446,L282053,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
44447,L282052,u1328,m89,DENNIS,Maybe he's hiding from something.
44448,L282051,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
44449,L281887,u1326,m89,BRENNA,It's in good condition.
44450,L281886,u1331,m89,EXAMINER,You're the expert.
44451,L281885,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore."
44452,L281884,u1331,m89,EXAMINER,Huh?
44453,L281883,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Claymore.
44454,L281882,u1331,m89,EXAMINER,Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
44455,L281881,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
44456,L281880,u1331,m89,EXAMINER,"Didn't look like it came from ""Toys-Are-Us"", that's why I called you."
44457,L281878,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Fine.
44458,L281877,u1331,m89,EXAMINER,How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
44459,L281874,u1331,m89,EXAMINER,This one came unassembled.
44460,L281873,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Doesn't have a head, does he?"
44461,L282217,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Thanks.
44462,L282216,u1343,m89,MAN,Happy birthday.
44463,L282215,u1326,m89,BRENNA,It's my birthday.
44464,L282214,u1343,m89,MAN,You're very macabre.
44465,L282213,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me."
44466,L282212,u1343,m89,MAN,That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
44467,L282036,u1338,m89,KIDELL,Carl Smith.
44468,L282035,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Would you remember his name?
44469,L282034,u1338,m89,KIDELL,There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
44470,L282033,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
44471,L282031,u1338,m89,KIDELL,Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
44472,L282030,u1326,m89,BRENNA,The boy _died_?
44473,L282029,u1338,m89,KIDELL,Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
44474,L282028,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I don't follow you.
44475,L282027,u1338,m89,KIDELL,Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
44476,L282026,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
44477,L282025,u1338,m89,KIDELL,No.
44478,L282024,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Then you didn't know Richard later on.
44479,L282023,u1338,m89,KIDELL,"Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house."
44480,L282022,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Why?
44481,L282021,u1338,m89,KIDELL,He was unsual.
44482,L282020,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"No thank you, I'm fine."
44483,L282019,u1338,m89,KIDELL,Would you like more tea?
44484,L282002,u1329,m89,DESK OFFICER,Anything in Maryland is close.
44485,L282001,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?"
44486,L282000,u1329,m89,DESK OFFICER,"Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia."
44487,L281999,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute."
44488,L281998,u1329,m89,DESK OFFICER,-Okay okay.
44489,L281997,u1326,m89,BRENNA,So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
44490,L281996,u1329,m89,DESK OFFICER,This is against the rules.
44491,L282738,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Yes.
44492,L282737,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?"
44493,L282736,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
44494,L282735,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You have lived forever.
44495,L282734,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
44496,L282733,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Not power.  Not control.
44497,L282732,u1326,m89,BRENNA,The inheritance.
44498,L282731,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
44499,L282727,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
44500,L282726,u1326,m89,BRENNA,No!
44501,L282725,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Get out.
44502,L282724,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!"
44503,L282723,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What is it?
44504,L282721,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!"
44505,L282720,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What's wrong?
44506,L282659,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
44507,L282658,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Will I see you again?
44508,L282657,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
44509,L282656,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,All of it finished.
44510,L282655,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What is it you want?
44511,L282654,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
44512,L282653,u1326,m89,BRENNA,But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
44513,L282652,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both."
44514,L282651,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What is it like?  Being you?
44515,L282640,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Damn you.
44516,L282639,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Come here, Brenna."
44517,L282638,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Don't.
44518,L282636,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Is that a threat?
44519,L282635,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I haven't killed _you_.
44520,L282634,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You kill with your left hand?
44521,L282633,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,There are differences.
44522,L282632,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between."
44523,L282631,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Sometimes innocents become involved.
44524,L282630,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What about that family in '31?
44525,L282629,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Not the same.
44526,L282628,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You killed those other two.
44527,L282627,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I didn't kill the watchman.
44528,L282626,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Of bodies.
44529,L282625,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
44530,L282624,u1326,m89,BRENNA,That's insane.
44531,L282623,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
44532,L282622,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
44533,L282621,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,He is older than I.
44534,L282620,u1326,m89,BRENNA,He knows about you.
44535,L282619,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Yes.
44536,L282618,u1326,m89,BRENNA,That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
44537,L282617,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
44538,L282614,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I'd like you to try.
44539,L282613,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,That would be difficult to explain.
44540,L282612,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Who are you?
44541,L282607,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Just a little crazy.
44542,L282606,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You are a very perceptive young woman.
44543,L282605,u1326,m89,BRENNA,My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
44544,L282604,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
44545,L282603,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I'm not even sure why.
44546,L282602,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I see.
44547,L282601,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
44548,L282600,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Why are you here?
44549,L282599,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same."
44550,L282598,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You won't.
44551,L282597,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I hope I never get that old.
44552,L282596,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,A factor of age.
44553,L282595,u1326,m89,BRENNA,It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
44554,L282594,u1326,m89,BRENNA,That's impossible.
44555,L282593,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,At least.
44556,L282592,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Then you must be at least 70 years old.
44557,L282590,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
44558,L282589,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You're using your son's name.
44559,L282588,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Yes.
44560,L282587,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"And you are William Taupin, aren't you?"
44561,L282586,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Yes.
44562,L282585,u1326,m89,BRENNA,William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
44563,L282584,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Follow me.
44564,L282583,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
44565,L282536,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,A little dusty.
44566,L282535,u1326,m89,BRENNA,It's beautiful.
44567,L282534,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then."
44568,L282532,u1326,m89,BRENNA,There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
44569,L282531,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Maybe it would do us both good.
44570,L282530,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
44571,L282529,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,They do it each year.
44572,L282528,u1326,m89,BRENNA,It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
44573,L282527,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Well, as long as we're stuck here."
44574,L282526,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Yes.
44575,L282525,u1326,m89,BRENNA,No.  So what now?  We just wait?
44576,L282523,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
44577,L282522,u1326,m89,BRENNA,The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
44578,L282521,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I wish I could.
44579,L282520,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Yes.
44580,L282519,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
44581,L282418,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I."
44582,L282417,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You want me to front for you.
44583,L282416,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
44584,L282415,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You make it all sound so simple.
44585,L282414,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
44586,L282413,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"When you finish, what then?"
44587,L282412,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Not all of them.
44588,L282411,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You did kill those men.
44589,L282410,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
44590,L282409,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What's all that?
44591,L282403,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You are.  Now.
44592,L282402,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
44593,L282401,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You've been listening to rumors.
44594,L282400,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Is this what you killed them with?
44595,L282398,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Maybe.
44596,L282397,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You're a fool.
44597,L282396,u1326,m89,BRENNA,You're wrong.
44598,L282395,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You had to do _nothing_!
44599,L282394,u1326,m89,BRENNA,No.  I had to talk to you.
44600,L282393,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,No one knows you're here?
44601,L282392,u1326,m89,BRENNA,No.
44602,L282292,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Are you?
44603,L282291,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,He sees me as a threat.
44604,L282289,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Go home.
44605,L282288,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face."
44606,L282287,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You are being foolish.
44607,L282286,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I'd rather hear yours.
44608,L282285,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
44609,L282284,u1326,m89,BRENNA,No.
44610,L282283,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Have you gone to the police?
44611,L282282,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
44612,L282281,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You?
44613,L282280,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What about me?
44614,L282279,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
44615,L282278,u1326,m89,BRENNA,He was innocent.
44616,L282277,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,That bothers you?
44617,L282276,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?"
44618,L282275,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Not your concern.
44619,L282274,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"He called you ""MacLeod""."
44620,L282273,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
44621,L282272,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What will you do now?
44622,L282271,u1326,m89,BRENNA,And you?
44623,L282270,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,At the moment?  Carl Smith.
44624,L282269,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Who is he?
44625,L282268,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Dupont Circle.
44626,L282267,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Where?
44627,L282266,u1326,m89,BRENNA,He tried to kill me last night.
44628,L282117,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What the hell is going on?
44629,L282116,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Tradition.
44630,L282115,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Why not?
44631,L282114,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
44632,L282113,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Jesus Christ.
44633,L282093,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright."
44634,L282092,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I have friends.
44635,L282090,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries."
44636,L282089,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I've been to Church Hill.
44637,L282088,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You have an active imagination.
44638,L282087,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that."
44639,L282086,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I don't know what you're talking about.
44640,L282085,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Does Carl Smith?
44641,L282084,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,People like that rarely leave business cards.
44642,L282083,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Who?
44643,L282082,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Probably.
44644,L282081,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Grave robbers?
44645,L282080,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?"
44646,L282079,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Someone beat you.
44647,L281958,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Good day, Miss Cartwright."
44648,L281957,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Good reflexes.
44649,L281956,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-"
44650,L281955,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-"
44651,L281954,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Basil the II.
44652,L281953,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Byzantine?
44653,L281952,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do."
44654,L281951,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years."
44655,L281950,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,It's not mine.
44656,L281949,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
44657,L281948,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?"
44658,L281947,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Very traditional.
44659,L281946,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Yes.
44660,L281945,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Do you play?
44661,L282048,u1354,m89,UNCLE JOE,Call your mother.  You never call her.
44662,L282047,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Thanks.
44663,L282046,u1354,m89,UNCLE JOE,Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
44664,L282045,u1354,m89,UNCLE JOE,Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
44665,L282044,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Now there's a new topic.
44666,L282043,u1354,m89,UNCLE JOE,Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
44667,L282040,u1354,m89,UNCLE JOE,"You're never ""just curious"".  You've met my neice, Brenna."
44668,L282039,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I'm just curious.
44669,L282038,u1354,m89,UNCLE JOE,Forget it.
44670,L282386,u1345,m89,MORAN,"Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's."
44671,L282385,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Never take up poker, Detective."
44672,L282384,u1345,m89,MORAN,I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
44673,L282383,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
44674,L282382,u1345,m89,MORAN,What were you doing in Felton?
44675,L282381,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What's all of this got to do with me?
44676,L282380,u1345,m89,MORAN,Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
44677,L282379,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What makes you so sure he's the one?
44678,L282378,u1345,m89,MORAN,I want Taupin.
44679,L282377,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"You're an asshole, Moran."
44680,L282376,u1345,m89,MORAN,"But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that."
44681,L282375,u1326,m89,BRENNA,It'll never stick.
44682,L282374,u1345,m89,MORAN,"You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder."
44683,L282373,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"What are you getting at, Moran?"
44684,L282372,u1345,m89,MORAN,"But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin."
44685,L282371,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Spare me the details.
44686,L282370,u1345,m89,MORAN,All fashionably without heads.
44687,L282369,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Four?
44688,L282368,u1345,m89,MORAN,What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
44689,L282367,u1326,m89,BRENNA,We've got nothing to say.
44690,L282366,u1345,m89,MORAN,You and I should talk first.
44691,L282365,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I'm calling an attorney.
44692,L282364,u1345,m89,MORAN,"Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons."
44693,L282363,u1326,m89,BRENNA,What do you want from me?
44694,L282362,u1345,m89,MORAN,I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
44695,L282361,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it."
44696,L282360,u1345,m89,MORAN,A murder.
44697,L282356,u1341,m89,LIBRARIAN,Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
44698,L282355,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Who is it?
44699,L282354,u1341,m89,LIBRARIAN,You always were hard to impress.
44700,L282353,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it."
44701,L282352,u1341,m89,LIBRARIAN,I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
44702,L282351,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
44703,L282350,u1341,m89,LIBRARIAN,Good way to lose your job.
44704,L282347,u1326,m89,BRENNA,Yeah.
44705,L282346,u1341,m89,LIBRARIAN,It's that important?
44706,L282345,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Corey, you _owe_ me."
44707,L282344,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now."
44708,L282343,u1341,m89,LIBRARIAN,You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
44709,L282342,u1326,m89,BRENNA,All I need is for you to check the name.
44710,L282341,u1341,m89,LIBRARIAN,"Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it."
44711,L281972,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Give it a rest Ned, huh?"
44712,L281971,u1350,m89,SUPERVISOR,You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
44713,L281970,u1326,m89,BRENNA,"Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two."
44714,L281967,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
44715,L281966,u1350,m89,SUPERVISOR,"Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here."
44716,L281961,u1326,m89,BRENNA,He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
44717,L281960,u1350,m89,SUPERVISOR,Why?
44718,L281959,u1326,m89,BRENNA,I don't believe him.
44719,L281990,u1327,m89,CONOR,Stop!
44720,L281989,u1352,m89,TAVERN MAN #2,-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
44721,L281988,u1327,m89,CONOR,Stop.
44722,L281987,u1352,m89,TAVERN MAN #2,-Auditorium nostrum-
44723,L281986,u1327,m89,CONOR,Be quiet.
44724,L281985,u1352,m89,TAVERN MAN #2,-Luceat ei-
44725,L281984,u1327,m89,CONOR,You'll not be bringing the church into this.
44726,L281983,u1352,m89,TAVERN MAN #2,-Et lux perpetua-
44727,L281982,u1327,m89,CONOR,What are you doing man?
44728,L281981,u1352,m89,TAVERN MAN #2,Requiem acer'nam donaei-
44729,L282333,u1327,m89,CONOR,I'll be back when I can.
44730,L282332,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company."
44731,L282328,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one."
44732,L282327,u1327,m89,CONOR,That is not me.
44733,L282326,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love."
44734,L282325,u1327,m89,CONOR,Of course.
44735,L282324,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them."
44736,L282323,u1327,m89,CONOR,I am not ready for this.
44737,L282322,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something."
44738,L282321,u1327,m89,CONOR,And you?
44739,L282320,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more."
44740,L282319,u1327,m89,CONOR,But why be so concerned about me?
44741,L282318,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned."
44742,L282317,u1327,m89,CONOR,I feel hardly nothing.
44743,L282316,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
44744,L282315,u1327,m89,CONOR,I do not think I like the sound of that.
44745,L282314,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing."
44746,L282313,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that."
44747,L282312,u1327,m89,CONOR,What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
44748,L282311,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod."
44749,L282310,u1327,m89,CONOR,"You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders."
44750,L282308,u1327,m89,CONOR,"If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed."
44751,L282307,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
44752,L282306,u1327,m89,CONOR,And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
44753,L282305,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You have a gift.  One you must protect.
44754,L282304,u1327,m89,CONOR,It's like to kill me first.
44755,L282303,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,It will take less effort as you learn.
44756,L282301,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Muy Bien!
44757,L282300,u1327,m89,CONOR,Impotent cow.
44758,L282299,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm."
44759,L282298,u1327,m89,CONOR,Go to hell.
44760,L282297,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
44761,L282296,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Again.  Try again.
44762,L282295,u1327,m89,CONOR,Me arm hurts.
44763,L282294,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Harder.  Concentrate harder.
44764,L282200,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
44765,L282199,u1327,m89,CONOR,Why?
44766,L282198,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
44767,L282197,u1327,m89,CONOR,How can I stop such a man?
44768,L282196,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end."
44769,L282195,u1327,m89,CONOR,But we cannot be killed.
44770,L282194,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all."
44771,L282193,u1327,m89,CONOR,Aye.
44772,L282192,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
44773,L282191,u1327,m89,CONOR,Why does he want to kill me?
44774,L282190,u1327,m89,CONOR,Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
44775,L282189,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
44776,L282188,u1327,m89,CONOR,Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
44777,L282187,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You will live.  Survive.
44778,L282186,u1327,m89,CONOR,What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
44779,L282185,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
44780,L282184,u1327,m89,CONOR,This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
44781,L282183,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"You are not dead, boy.  Accept it."
44782,L282182,u1327,m89,CONOR,This can't be.
44783,L282181,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
44784,L282173,u1327,m89,CONOR,No!
44785,L282172,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,It is the truth.
44786,L282171,u1327,m89,CONOR,This is madness!
44787,L282170,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Listen to me.  Hear the words.
44788,L282169,u1327,m89,CONOR,No!
44789,L282168,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,It is as you are.
44790,L282166,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,We are immortal.
44791,L282165,u1327,m89,CONOR,What?
44792,L282164,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed."
44793,L282163,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Not even a single lifetime.
44794,L282162,u1327,m89,CONOR,I'm twenty-two.
44795,L282161,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You are still so very young.
44796,L282160,u1327,m89,CONOR,I don't understand.
44797,L282159,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently."
44798,L282158,u1327,m89,CONOR,He told me there could be only one.
44799,L282157,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,We are brothers.
44800,L282156,u1327,m89,CONOR,I don't know why.
44801,L282155,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You feel you know me.
44802,L282154,u1327,m89,CONOR,It is less.
44803,L282153,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Does it change with me in the room?
44804,L282152,u1327,m89,CONOR,Yes.  Always.
44805,L282151,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?"
44806,L282150,u1327,m89,CONOR,You are the same?
44807,L282149,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
44808,L282147,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,It was time for our paths to cross.
44809,L282146,u1327,m89,CONOR,You know me home.  Me name.
44810,L282145,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
44811,L282144,u1327,m89,CONOR,You're a long way from Inverness.
44812,L282143,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
44813,L282142,u1327,m89,CONOR,Why are you here?
44814,L282141,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
44815,L282140,u1327,m89,CONOR,Pheasant.
44816,L282139,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?"
44817,L282138,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier."
44818,L282137,u1327,m89,CONOR,How can you know this?
44819,L282136,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
44820,L282135,u1327,m89,CONOR,I was driven out.
44821,L282134,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution."
44822,L282133,u1327,m89,CONOR,Aye.
44823,L282132,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?"
44824,L282131,u1327,m89,CONOR,I did at that.
44825,L282130,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,But you lived.
44826,L282129,u1327,m89,CONOR,I was nearly killed.
44827,L282128,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Your marks would suggest great injury.
44828,L282127,u1327,m89,CONOR,Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
44829,L282126,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,"Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?"
44830,L282125,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Please go to no trouble.
44831,L282124,u1327,m89,CONOR,"I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here."
44832,L282123,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
44833,L282122,u1327,m89,CONOR,You're not from these parts.
44834,L282121,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
44835,L282120,u1327,m89,CONOR,Aye.
44836,L282119,u1349,m89,ROMIREZ,Your name is Conor?
44837,L282118,u1327,m89,CONOR,Afternoon.
44838,L281943,u1344,m89,MARA,Do what you must.
44839,L281942,u1327,m89,CONOR,"If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you."
44840,L281941,u1327,m89,CONOR,"You're not talking sense, Mara!"
44841,L281940,u1344,m89,MARA,"Leave me alone, Conor.  Please."
44842,L281939,u1327,m89,CONOR,"I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you."
44843,L281938,u1344,m89,MARA,"Please not be touching me, Conor."
44844,L281936,u1344,m89,MARA,Me father has taken back my hand.
44845,L281935,u1327,m89,CONOR,"You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins."
44846,L281934,u1344,m89,MARA,"I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you."
44847,L281933,u1327,m89,CONOR,That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
44848,L281932,u1344,m89,MARA,There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
44849,L281931,u1327,m89,CONOR,Who?
44850,L281930,u1344,m89,MARA,Some think not.
44851,L281929,u1327,m89,CONOR,So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
44852,L281928,u1344,m89,MARA,Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
44853,L281927,u1327,m89,CONOR,But I did live.
44854,L281926,u1344,m89,MARA,"You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived."
44855,L281925,u1327,m89,CONOR,What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
44856,L281924,u1344,m89,MARA,My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
44857,L281923,u1327,m89,CONOR,I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
44858,L281922,u1344,m89,MARA,I have no future husband.
44859,L281921,u1327,m89,CONOR,"I'm your future husband, remember?"
44860,L282549,u1327,m89,CONOR,Do you have cause to bothering us?
44861,L282548,u1337,m89,KATHERINE,David.
44862,L282546,u1337,m89,KATHERINE,Kiss me.
44863,L282545,u1327,m89,CONOR,Far away.
44864,L282544,u1337,m89,KATHERINE,That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
44865,L282543,u1327,m89,CONOR,Like you.
44866,L282542,u1337,m89,KATHERINE,Something pretty.
44867,L282541,u1327,m89,CONOR,What would you like?
44868,L282540,u1337,m89,KATHERINE,Oh please.  Another one.
44869,L282502,u1330,m89,DUPONT,So sure?
44870,L282501,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,"Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you."
44871,L282500,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Finish yours?
44872,L282499,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Finish your prayers?
44873,L282498,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Romirez is dust.
44874,L282497,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Romirez understood.  Not you.
44875,L282496,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,"I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players."
44876,L282495,u1330,m89,DUPONT,You're wrong.
44877,L282494,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
44878,L282493,u1330,m89,DUPONT,No doubt.
44879,L282492,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
44880,L282491,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Not so scared.
44881,L282489,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,It's all we have.
44882,L282488,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Tradition.
44883,L282487,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,State of grace and all that.
44884,L282485,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Certainly not me.
44885,L282484,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Who am I deceiving?
44886,L282456,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Not likely.
44887,L282455,u1342,m89,MAJOR,Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
44888,L282454,u1342,m89,MAJOR,Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
44889,L282453,u1330,m89,DUPONT,We need more time.
44890,L282452,u1342,m89,MAJOR,I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
44891,L282451,u1330,m89,DUPONT,They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
44892,L282450,u1342,m89,MAJOR,Complete your inspection?
44893,L282483,u1330,m89,DUPONT,I had no choice.
44894,L282482,u1348,m89,MULET,You see Major?  You are not so different...
44895,L282479,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Either you are with me or against me.
44896,L282478,u1348,m89,MULET,"You are really going to force this, aren't you?"
44897,L282477,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Do not turn your back on me.
44898,L282476,u1348,m89,MULET,"Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  ""Threaten you""?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for."
44899,L282475,u1330,m89,DUPONT,"Don't threaten me, Private."
44900,L282474,u1348,m89,MULET,Stay out of it.
44901,L282473,u1330,m89,DUPONT,We must talk.
44902,L282472,u1348,m89,MULET,"It never changes, Major."
44903,L282471,u1330,m89,DUPONT,It can be different.  It must be.
44904,L282470,u1348,m89,MULET,"Help?  I've seen others ""help"". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter."
44905,L282469,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
44906,L282468,u1348,m89,MULET,We have no understanding.
44907,L282467,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Wait.  I think we understand each other.
44908,L282466,u1348,m89,MULET,"If you wish to play games, Major."
44909,L282465,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Equals?
44910,L282464,u1348,m89,MULET,"Excuse me, ""sir"".  I thought we spoke as equals."
44911,L282463,u1330,m89,DUPONT,"I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me."
44912,L282462,u1348,m89,MULET,You seem to understand a great deal.
44913,L282461,u1330,m89,DUPONT,I understand you joined up in Bremen.
44914,L282460,u1348,m89,MULET,Second musketeer.
44915,L282459,u1330,m89,DUPONT,What is your position?
44916,L282458,u1348,m89,MULET,Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
44917,L282457,u1330,m89,DUPONT,I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
44918,L282448,u1348,m89,MULET,Mulet.
44919,L282447,u1330,m89,DUPONT,Your name?
44920,L281835,u1332,m89,FATHER,He's a MacLeod.
44921,L281834,u1346,m89,MOTHER,"But Ian, he's still but a boy."
44922,L281833,u1332,m89,FATHER,Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
44923,L281832,u1346,m89,MOTHER,Must he go?
44924,L281831,u1332,m89,FATHER,"Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke."
44925,L281829,u1346,m89,MOTHER,Have you time for some- thing to eat?
44926,L281828,u1332,m89,FATHER,"Ah, Conor, how you look a man."
44927,L282518,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Yes, he was."
44928,L282517,u1333,m89,GRANDSON,Your father must be smart.
44929,L282516,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,My father taught me.
44930,L282515,u1333,m89,GRANDSON,Where did you learn that?
44931,L282514,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves."
44932,L282512,u1333,m89,GRANDSON,Thanks.
44933,L282511,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest."
44934,L282665,u1345,m89,MORAN,No.  I want this to be all ours.
44935,L282664,u1334,m89,INSPECTOR,Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
44936,L282663,u1345,m89,MORAN,Round up who you can and put them on standby.
44937,L282662,u1334,m89,INSPECTOR,Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
44938,L282661,u1345,m89,MORAN,Are you sure?
44939,L282428,u1334,m89,INSPECTOR,You'd think he'd had practice.
44940,L282427,u1345,m89,MORAN,Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
44941,L282426,u1334,m89,INSPECTOR,Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
44942,L282425,u1345,m89,MORAN,Any other I.D.s come up?
44943,L282424,u1334,m89,INSPECTOR,We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
44944,L282423,u1345,m89,MORAN,Yeah.
44945,L282422,u1334,m89,INSPECTOR,Figure she's with him?
44946,L282421,u1345,m89,MORAN,I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
44947,L282015,u1335,m89,INTRUDER,We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
44948,L282014,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,_Answer_ me.
44949,L282013,u1335,m89,INTRUDER,None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
44950,L282012,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,He knows I'm here.  How?
44951,L282011,u1335,m89,INTRUDER,He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
44952,L282010,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,And the Bulgarian?
44953,L282009,u1335,m89,INTRUDER,The last four.
44954,L282008,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,How many came?
44955,L282007,u1335,m89,INTRUDER,Smith.  Carl Smith.
44956,L282006,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,What name is he using?
44957,L282005,u1335,m89,INTRUDER,I don't know.
44958,L282004,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Where!
44959,L282258,u1336,m89,KAHN,"You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore."
44960,L282257,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You're wrong.
44961,L282256,u1336,m89,KAHN,The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
44962,L282255,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I've had a few more concerns.
44963,L282254,u1336,m89,KAHN,Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
44964,L282253,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?"
44965,L282252,u1336,m89,KAHN,"No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon."
44966,L282251,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You're insane.
44967,L282250,u1336,m89,KAHN,I knew his great-grandfather.
44968,L282249,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You were never a kid.
44969,L282248,u1336,m89,KAHN,I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
44970,L282246,u1336,m89,KAHN,-Since you last saw me.
44971,L282245,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I haven't drunk this much since-
44972,L282244,u1336,m89,KAHN,He always did.
44973,L282243,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,He found us even there.
44974,L282242,u1336,m89,KAHN,Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
44975,L282241,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
44976,L282240,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Offered the Pope one of his whores.
44977,L282239,u1336,m89,KAHN,"But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?"
44978,L282238,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"Neuvich, the clown of the crusades."
44979,L282237,u1336,m89,KAHN,"I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his ""heretic stronghold"" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich."
44980,L282234,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"It's good to see you, Kahn."
44981,L282233,u1336,m89,KAHN,Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
44982,L282232,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,And have you something to settle with me?
44983,L282231,u1336,m89,KAHN,"It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores."
44984,L282230,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,What are you doing here?
44985,L282229,u1336,m89,KAHN,"Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence."
44986,L282228,u1336,m89,KAHN,How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
44987,L282227,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,How did you find me?
44988,L282226,u1336,m89,KAHN,Head still secure to the neck.
44989,L282225,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,How are you?
44990,L282224,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Sit.
44991,L282223,u1336,m89,KAHN,Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
44992,L282222,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Kahn?
44993,L282221,u1336,m89,KAHN,Spare a chair?
44994,L282704,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Get up.
44995,L282703,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Leave her alone.
44996,L282702,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
44997,L282701,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Go to hell.
44998,L282700,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,It's all we have.
44999,L282699,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Tradition.
45000,L282698,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,"I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy."
45001,L282697,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"What's the point!  You have me, finish it!"
45002,L282696,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,This isn't done.  Get up.
45003,L282695,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,What's the point?
45004,L282687,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,As you wish.
45005,L282686,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Leave her out of this.
45006,L282685,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
45007,L282112,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,MACLEOD!
45008,L282111,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Run!
45009,L282103,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,I do hope she enjoys a good show.
45010,L282102,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Of sorts.
45011,L282101,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Friend of yours?
45012,L282100,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,"My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent."
45013,L282099,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,You've been here from the start.
45014,L282098,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Not so long.
45015,L282097,u1339,m89,KNIGHT,Long time.
45016,L282679,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Should I care?
45017,L282678,u1340,m89,KNIGHT'S VOICE,"Yes laddie, I have her."
45018,L282677,u1340,m89,KNIGHT'S VOICE,Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
45019,L282676,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,And if I refuse?
45020,L282675,u1340,m89,KNIGHT'S VOICE,I want you to come to me.
45021,L282674,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Are you here?
45022,L282673,u1340,m89,KNIGHT'S VOICE,We have some unfinished business.
45023,L282078,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,"I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant."
45024,L282077,u1345,m89,MORAN,All I need is time.
45025,L282076,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Do you?
45026,L282075,u1345,m89,MORAN,"Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea."
45027,L282074,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,He's mistaken.
45028,L282073,u1345,m89,MORAN,A neighbor saw your car leave.
45029,L282072,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Home.
45030,L282071,u1345,m89,MORAN,Where were you Tuesday night?
45031,L282070,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,My condolences.
45032,L281911,u1345,m89,MORAN,For the moment.
45033,L281910,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,A mystery.
45034,L281909,u1345,m89,MORAN,"It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood."
45035,L281908,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Your murder weapon?
45036,L281907,u1345,m89,MORAN,A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
45037,L281906,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I presume it's a sword.
45038,L281905,u1345,m89,MORAN,Do you know what this is?
45039,L281904,u1345,m89,MORAN,You're wrong.
45040,L281903,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,That's none of your business.
45041,L281902,u1345,m89,MORAN,What were _you_ looking for?
45042,L281901,u1345,m89,MORAN,Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
45043,L281900,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,What are you getting at?
45044,L281899,u1345,m89,MORAN,Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
45045,L281898,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,American.
45046,L281897,u1345,m89,MORAN,Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
45047,L281896,u1345,m89,MORAN,He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
45048,L281895,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,It doesn't.
45049,L281894,u1345,m89,MORAN,His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
45050,L281893,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,No.
45051,L281892,u1345,m89,MORAN,Did you know the victim?
45052,L281891,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
45053,L281890,u1345,m89,MORAN,"Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?"
45054,L281889,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Yes.
45055,L281888,u1345,m89,MORAN,This your present address?
45056,L281919,u1346,m89,MOTHER,"They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever."
45057,L281918,u1353,m89,TRAVELLER,But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
45058,L281917,u1346,m89,MOTHER,"Steven, Conor didn't die."
45059,L281916,u1353,m89,TRAVELLER,I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
45060,L281915,u1346,m89,MOTHER,You're a kind man to be sure.
45061,L281914,u1353,m89,TRAVELLER,I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
45062,L281913,u1346,m89,MOTHER,"Ah Steven, it is good to see you."
45063,L282581,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,Just your pappy scared some.
45064,L282580,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Nothing to be sorry about.
45065,L282510,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,I'm sure that's true.
45066,L282509,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
45067,L282508,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,No.
45068,L282507,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
45069,L282506,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,Same.
45070,L282505,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,Morning Mr. North
45071,L282211,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,I'll send them right up.
45072,L282210,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,When may I expect the cleaners?
45073,L282209,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,The resemblance is amazing.
45074,L282208,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,We were very close.
45075,L282207,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
45076,L282206,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,His only kid.
45077,L282205,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,"You're one of William's kids, huh?"
45078,L282203,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,"Oh yes, more than enough."
45079,L282202,u1351,m89,TAUPIN,The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
45080,L282201,u1347,m89,MR. NORTH,When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
45081,L283758,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings."
45082,L283757,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty."
45083,L283756,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
45084,L283755,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution."
45085,L283754,u1372,m90,MURPHY,This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
45086,L283735,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,Why don't you fellows get your own news?
45087,L283734,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?"
45088,L284536,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,Open this door!
45089,L284535,u1364,m90,HILDY,Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
45090,L284533,u1364,m90,HILDY,That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
45091,L284532,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,What's the idea of locking this?
45092,L284531,u1364,m90,HILDY,Who is it?
45093,L283742,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"Well, congratulations! Good luck!"
45094,L283741,u1364,m90,HILDY,I'm getting married tomorrow.
45095,L283740,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,What doing?
45096,L283739,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself."
45097,L283738,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,Are you back?
45098,L283737,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,Hildy!
45099,L283736,u1364,m90,HILDY,Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
45100,L284568,u1357,m90,BURNS,Bon jour!
45101,L284567,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"Au revoir, mon capitaine."
45102,L284566,u1357,m90,BURNS,I'll keep you in mind.
45103,L284564,u1357,m90,BURNS,It doesn't have to rhyme!
45104,L284563,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,I got my rhyming dictionary in --
45105,L284562,u1357,m90,BURNS,Exactly!
45106,L284561,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,Sort of a Jack London style?
45107,L284560,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!"
45108,L284559,u1357,m90,BURNS,I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
45109,L284558,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,Seventy-five.
45110,L284557,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?"
45111,L284556,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,No. Roy. Roy V.
45112,L284555,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?"
45113,L284552,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,What?
45114,L284551,u1357,m90,BURNS,Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
45115,L284550,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"Remember the ending?  "" -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."""
45116,L284549,u1357,m90,BURNS,The poem?... The poem was great!
45117,L284548,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?"
45118,L284547,u1357,m90,BURNS,I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
45119,L284546,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope."
45120,L284545,u1357,m90,BURNS,I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
45121,L284544,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,How do you mean?
45122,L284541,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"Excuse me, I just want to --"
45123,L284540,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hello, Bensinger."
45124,L284539,u1355,m90,BENSINGER,"Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here."
45125,L284495,u1364,m90,HILDY,Fine.
45126,L284494,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station."
45127,L284491,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here."
45128,L284490,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back."
45129,L284487,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Thank you.
45130,L284486,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars."
45131,L284485,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, yes. Here it is."
45132,L284484,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
45133,L284483,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly."
45134,L284482,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Did you give her the money?
45135,L284481,u1364,m90,HILDY,Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
45136,L284480,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Hildy! Where's mother?
45137,L284479,u1364,m90,HILDY,Out some place.
45138,L284478,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Where'd she go?
45139,L284477,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, she was here."
45140,L284468,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!"
45141,L284467,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours."
45142,L284466,u1364,m90,HILDY,We'll explain the whole thing to them.
45143,L284465,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
45144,L284461,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --"
45145,L284460,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Not through any help of yours, Hildy."
45146,L284459,u1364,m90,HILDY,BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
45147,L284458,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Hello, Bruce..."
45148,L284457,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Hildy!
45149,L283976,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger."
45150,L283975,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --"
45151,L283974,u1364,m90,HILDY,No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
45152,L283973,u1364,m90,HILDY,The Criminal Courts Building.
45153,L283972,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Did you finish the interview?
45154,L283971,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!"
45155,L283970,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out."
45156,L283969,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?"
45157,L283968,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been."
45158,L283967,u1364,m90,HILDY,I'm sure you haven't any.
45159,L283966,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
45160,L283965,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Yes, wasn't it?"
45161,L283964,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition."
45162,L283963,u1364,m90,HILDY,"The check, Bruce!"
45163,L283962,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I lost my wallet.
45164,L283961,u1364,m90,HILDY,What's the matter?
45165,L283806,u1364,m90,HILDY,Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
45166,L283805,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?"
45167,L283799,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth."
45168,L283798,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?"
45169,L283693,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I'll be careful, darling. You be, please."
45170,L283692,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey."
45171,L283691,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear."
45172,L283690,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"But I don't gamble, Hilda!"
45173,L283689,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --"
45174,L283688,u1356,m90,BRUCE,But --
45175,L283687,u1364,m90,HILDY,"On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets."
45176,L283686,u1356,m90,BRUCE,The five hundred? Sure.
45177,L283685,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?"
45178,L283684,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"All right, dear."
45179,L283679,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Better make that a certified check, Walter."
45180,L283678,u1356,m90,BRUCE,About twenty-five hundred dollars.
45181,L283673,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
45182,L283672,u1364,m90,HILDY,"According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?"
45183,L283671,u1356,m90,BRUCE,But --
45184,L283670,u1364,m90,HILDY,And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
45185,L283669,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars."
45186,L283668,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?"
45187,L283667,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!"
45188,L283632,u1364,m90,HILDY,He certainly -- hic -- does!
45189,L283631,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?"
45190,L283630,u1364,m90,HILDY,No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
45191,L283629,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Too hot?
45192,L283624,u1364,m90,HILDY,That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
45193,L283623,u1356,m90,BRUCE,If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
45194,L283622,u1364,m90,HILDY,He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
45195,L283621,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm."
45196,L283620,u1364,m90,HILDY,"You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is."
45197,L283619,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow."
45198,L283585,u1364,m90,HILDY,"It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train."
45199,L283584,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Oh, it isn't like that."
45200,L283367,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I'll come a-running, pardner."
45201,L283366,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here."
45202,L283365,u1364,m90,HILDY,"My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it."
45203,L283364,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
45204,L283363,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling."
45205,L283362,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
45206,L283360,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
45207,L283359,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you."
45208,L284510,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Say, I want to be sure, too!"
45209,L284509,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure."
45210,L284508,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Gee! Take a look, will you?"
45211,L284507,u1357,m90,BURNS,There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
45212,L284506,u1356,m90,BRUCE,The money? Why?
45213,L284505,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you."
45214,L284504,u1357,m90,BURNS,That's the kind of stuff they want!
45215,L284503,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know."
45216,L284502,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?"
45217,L284501,u1356,m90,BRUCE,And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
45218,L284500,u1357,m90,BURNS,Ts! Ts! Ts!
45219,L284499,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it."
45220,L284498,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all."
45221,L284497,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!"
45222,L284496,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you."
45223,L284489,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --"
45224,L284488,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here..."
45225,L284476,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
45226,L284475,u1357,m90,BURNS,No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
45227,L284456,u1357,m90,BURNS,"What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?"
45228,L284455,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Hildy!
45229,L283790,u1356,m90,BRUCE,So long.
45230,L283789,u1357,m90,BURNS,Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
45231,L283788,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything."
45232,L283787,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?"
45233,L283786,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Thanks a lot.
45234,L283785,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man."
45235,L283784,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
45236,L283783,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again."
45237,L283782,u1357,m90,BURNS,"That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute."
45238,L283781,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, she'll know some day."
45239,L283780,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
45240,L283779,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything."
45241,L283776,u1357,m90,BURNS,"No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over."
45242,L283775,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you."
45243,L283774,u1357,m90,BURNS,And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
45244,L283773,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I'm beginning to realize that.
45245,L283772,u1357,m90,BURNS,"And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too."
45246,L283771,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, of course, if you put it that way."
45247,L283770,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?"
45248,L283769,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, I'm independent, too."
45249,L283768,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent."
45250,L283767,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I feel I ought to take care of her.
45251,L283766,u1357,m90,BURNS,Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
45252,L283765,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
45253,L283696,u1357,m90,BURNS,You haven't seen anything yet.
45254,L283695,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
45255,L283653,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life."
45256,L283652,u1357,m90,BURNS,Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
45257,L283651,u1356,m90,BRUCE,How long would the interview take?
45258,L283648,u1357,m90,BURNS,How?
45259,L283647,u1356,m90,BRUCE,But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
45260,L283646,u1357,m90,BURNS,All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
45261,L283645,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Are you sure Williams is not all there?
45262,L283640,u1357,m90,BURNS,It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
45263,L283639,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
45264,L283634,u1357,m90,BURNS,Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
45265,L283633,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Anything the matter?
45266,L283609,u1357,m90,BURNS,I see what you mean.
45267,L283608,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts."
45268,L283607,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do."
45269,L283604,u1357,m90,BURNS,I don't blame them.
45270,L283603,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life."
45271,L283602,u1357,m90,BURNS,"How's business, Bruce?"
45272,L283600,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town..."
45273,L283599,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know."
45274,L283598,u1357,m90,BURNS,"That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!"
45275,L283597,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Just for the first year.
45276,L283596,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?"
45277,L283595,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, I'll try to give her one."
45278,L283591,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
45279,L283590,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me."
45280,L283588,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind."
45281,L283587,u1356,m90,BRUCE,No. My mother.
45282,L283586,u1357,m90,BURNS,Mother? But your mother --
45283,L283583,u1357,m90,BURNS,Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
45284,L283582,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married."
45285,L283581,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?"
45286,L283560,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!"
45287,L283559,u1356,m90,BRUCE,No -- she didn't.
45288,L283558,u1357,m90,BURNS,Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
45289,L283557,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Where are we going?
45290,L283556,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce."
45291,L283555,u1357,m90,BURNS,"That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency."
45292,L283554,u1356,m90,BRUCE,"Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning."
45293,L283553,u1357,m90,BURNS,"But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?"
45294,L283552,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Oh.
45295,L283551,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man."
45296,L283550,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
45297,L283549,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --"
45298,L283548,u1356,m90,BRUCE,
45299,L283547,u1357,m90,BURNS,"This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake."
45300,L283544,u1357,m90,BURNS,Then who are you?
45301,L283543,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Yes!
45302,L283542,u1357,m90,BURNS,You're Bruce Baldwin?
45303,L283541,u1356,m90,BRUCE,I'm Bruce Baldwin!
45304,L283540,u1357,m90,BURNS,I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
45305,L283539,u1356,m90,BRUCE,Mr. Burns --
45306,L284836,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Get out of here, you!"
45307,L284835,u1357,m90,BURNS,What's this?
45308,L284826,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions."
45309,L284825,u1357,m90,BURNS,You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
45310,L284784,u1357,m90,BURNS,Do you want to get us scooped?
45311,L284783,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"No, you don't!"
45312,L284782,u1357,m90,BURNS,Call Duffy!
45313,L284745,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!"
45314,L284744,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?"
45315,L284729,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys."
45316,L284728,u1357,m90,BURNS,I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
45317,L284727,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it."
45318,L284726,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars."
45319,L284722,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
45320,L284721,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff."
45321,L284720,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this."
45322,L284719,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?"
45323,L284718,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns."
45324,L284709,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
45325,L284708,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman."
45326,L284701,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!"
45327,L284700,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself."
45328,L284685,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
45329,L284684,u1357,m90,BURNS,Get out!
45330,L284683,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,You'll ask me to what?
45331,L284682,u1357,m90,BURNS,"If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out."
45332,L284668,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of."
45333,L284667,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?"
45334,L284874,u1368,m90,MAYOR,What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
45335,L284873,u1357,m90,BURNS,Save that for the Tribune.
45336,L284861,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?"
45337,L284860,u1357,m90,BURNS,Out of the mouths of babes.
45338,L284859,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child."
45339,L284830,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"The power of the press, huh!"
45340,L284829,u1357,m90,BURNS,This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
45341,L284828,u1368,m90,MAYOR,All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
45342,L284827,u1357,m90,BURNS,Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
45343,L284823,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Your luck's not with you now!
45344,L284822,u1357,m90,BURNS,Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
45345,L284983,u1364,m90,HILDY,You -- you!!
45346,L284982,u1357,m90,BURNS,"But, Hildy -- I can explain --"
45347,L284978,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!"
45348,L284977,u1357,m90,BURNS,It'll be Heaven!
45349,L284976,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like."
45350,L284975,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hildy, darling!"
45351,L284972,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  ""With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."""
45352,L284971,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Walter, you can't do that!"
45353,L284970,u1357,m90,BURNS,How about Bruce's?
45354,L284961,u1364,m90,HILDY,You're not fooling anybody.
45355,L284960,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!"
45356,L284959,u1364,m90,HILDY,"That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge."
45357,L284950,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?"
45358,L284949,u1364,m90,HILDY,What!
45359,L284945,u1357,m90,BURNS,I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
45360,L284944,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over."
45361,L284943,u1357,m90,BURNS,"What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?"
45362,L284942,u1364,m90,HILDY,What's the matter with my brains?
45363,L284941,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination."
45364,L284940,u1364,m90,HILDY,What would you do if it was a daughter?
45365,L284939,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper."
45366,L284938,u1364,m90,HILDY,Walter!
45367,L284937,u1357,m90,BURNS,Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
45368,L284936,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?"
45369,L284935,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?"
45370,L284934,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!"
45371,L284933,u1357,m90,BURNS,"That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!"
45372,L284932,u1364,m90,HILDY,"A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!"
45373,L284931,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either."
45374,L284930,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it."
45375,L284929,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns."
45376,L284928,u1364,m90,HILDY,"It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?"
45377,L284927,u1357,m90,BURNS,Sure.
45378,L284926,u1364,m90,HILDY,"On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?"
45379,L284925,u1357,m90,BURNS,Where'd you wire him?
45380,L284924,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming."
45381,L284923,u1357,m90,BURNS,What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
45382,L284922,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter."
45383,L284921,u1357,m90,BURNS,"And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!"
45384,L284920,u1364,m90,HILDY,Thanks.
45385,L284919,u1357,m90,BURNS,"The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!"
45386,L284918,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!"
45387,L284917,u1357,m90,BURNS,Then why are you doing it?
45388,L284916,u1364,m90,HILDY,Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
45389,L284915,u1357,m90,BURNS,Hildy!
45390,L284914,u1364,m90,HILDY,What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
45391,L284913,u1357,m90,BURNS,Well -- what is it?
45392,L284911,u1364,m90,HILDY,All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
45393,L284910,u1357,m90,BURNS,Flip a coin.
45394,L284909,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I don't know what to do, Walter."
45395,L284908,u1357,m90,BURNS,"He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?"
45396,L284907,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --"
45397,L284906,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning."
45398,L284905,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter."
45399,L284904,u1357,m90,BURNS,Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
45400,L284903,u1364,m90,HILDY,"That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours."
45401,L284902,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee."
45402,L284901,u1364,m90,HILDY,Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
45403,L284900,u1357,m90,BURNS,In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
45404,L284899,u1364,m90,HILDY,"We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week."
45405,L284898,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?"
45406,L284897,u1364,m90,HILDY,Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
45407,L284896,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?"
45408,L284895,u1364,m90,HILDY,We've certainly been in some swell jams.
45409,L284894,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy."
45410,L284893,u1364,m90,HILDY,In a way.
45411,L284892,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun."
45412,L284891,u1364,m90,HILDY,Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
45413,L284890,u1357,m90,BURNS,Don't tell me you were worried!
45414,L284889,u1364,m90,HILDY,How was that for a tight squeeze?
45415,L284882,u1357,m90,BURNS,"And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think."
45416,L284881,u1364,m90,HILDY,Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
45417,L284880,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say."
45418,L284855,u1364,m90,HILDY,Who did you talk to?
45419,L284854,u1357,m90,BURNS,When did you deliver this first?
45420,L284851,u1364,m90,HILDY,Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
45421,L284850,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Murder, uh?"
45422,L284849,u1364,m90,HILDY,Wait a minute!  Let go there!
45423,L284724,u1357,m90,BURNS,Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
45424,L284723,u1364,m90,HILDY,No!
45425,L284695,u1357,m90,BURNS,What is it? Here!
45426,L284694,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, you don't! Walter!"
45427,L284658,u1364,m90,HILDY,Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
45428,L284657,u1357,m90,BURNS,Don't open that!
45429,L284656,u1364,m90,HILDY,I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
45430,L284655,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!"
45431,L284654,u1364,m90,HILDY,Yes.
45432,L284653,u1357,m90,BURNS,"When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --"
45433,L284652,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, I see. I beg your pardon."
45434,L284651,u1357,m90,BURNS,Will you come here?
45435,L284650,u1364,m90,HILDY,Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
45436,L284649,u1357,m90,BURNS,Come here. See if we can move it.
45437,L284648,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Ring that number, will you?"
45438,L284646,u1357,m90,BURNS,That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
45439,L284645,u1364,m90,HILDY,Lafayette two-one-hundred.
45440,L284633,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie."
45441,L284632,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?"
45442,L284631,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!"
45443,L284630,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?"
45444,L284629,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?"
45445,L284628,u1364,m90,HILDY,Is this the Community Hospital?
45446,L284627,u1357,m90,BURNS,I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
45447,L284626,u1364,m90,HILDY,Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
45448,L284625,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!"
45449,L284624,u1364,m90,HILDY,Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
45450,L284623,u1357,m90,BURNS,What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
45451,L284622,u1364,m90,HILDY,Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
45452,L284621,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?"
45453,L284620,u1364,m90,HILDY,Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
45454,L284619,u1357,m90,BURNS,Hello -- hello...
45455,L284616,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!"
45456,L284615,u1357,m90,BURNS,"If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!"
45457,L284614,u1364,m90,HILDY,I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
45458,L284613,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Look at me, Hildy --"
45459,L284612,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!"
45460,L284611,u1357,m90,BURNS,"If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?"
45461,L284610,u1364,m90,HILDY,What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
45462,L284609,u1357,m90,BURNS,"It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be."
45463,L284606,u1357,m90,BURNS,Was she? Did you notice?
45464,L284605,u1364,m90,HILDY,Don't tell me -- was she killed?
45465,L284595,u1364,m90,HILDY,Louie!
45466,L284594,u1357,m90,BURNS,Where is she? Tell me!
45467,L284587,u1357,m90,BURNS,You been in a fight?
45468,L284586,u1364,m90,HILDY,What happened?
45469,L284585,u1357,m90,BURNS,What did you do with her?
45470,L284584,u1364,m90,HILDY,Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
45471,L284579,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous."
45472,L284578,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?"
45473,L284576,u1357,m90,BURNS,Finished!
45474,L284575,u1364,m90,HILDY,I'm finished.
45475,L284574,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!"
45476,L284573,u1357,m90,BURNS,You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
45477,L284572,u1364,m90,HILDY,Double-crossing swine!
45478,L284529,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?"
45479,L284528,u1364,m90,HILDY,Is he coming back here?
45480,L284527,u1357,m90,BURNS,Railroad tickets.
45481,L284526,u1364,m90,HILDY,What tickets?
45482,L284525,u1357,m90,BURNS,Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
45483,L284524,u1364,m90,HILDY,Where's Bruce?
45484,L284523,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!"
45485,L284520,u1364,m90,HILDY,Where's Butch?
45486,L284519,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!"
45487,L284493,u1364,m90,HILDY,"All right, Walter."
45488,L284492,u1357,m90,BURNS,Hildy!
45489,L284464,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Okay, Walter."
45490,L284463,u1357,m90,BURNS,"For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!"
45491,L284451,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!"
45492,L284450,u1364,m90,HILDY,How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
45493,L284449,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!"
45494,L284448,u1364,m90,HILDY,Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
45495,L284446,u1364,m90,HILDY,Where's some paper?
45496,L284445,u1357,m90,BURNS,All the words you've got.
45497,L284444,u1364,m90,HILDY,How much do you want on it?
45498,L284443,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!"
45499,L284442,u1364,m90,HILDY,Huh!
45500,L284441,u1357,m90,BURNS,Hildy!
45501,L284440,u1357,m90,BURNS,We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
45502,L284439,u1364,m90,HILDY,You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
45503,L284438,u1357,m90,BURNS,Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
45504,L284437,u1364,m90,HILDY,That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
45505,L284436,u1357,m90,BURNS,We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
45506,L284435,u1364,m90,HILDY,Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
45507,L284434,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!"
45508,L284433,u1364,m90,HILDY,Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
45509,L284432,u1357,m90,BURNS,You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
45510,L284431,u1364,m90,HILDY,I get it!
45511,L284430,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him."
45512,L284429,u1364,m90,HILDY,I'd like to think.
45513,L284428,u1357,m90,BURNS,Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
45514,L284427,u1364,m90,HILDY,Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
45515,L284426,u1357,m90,BURNS,You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!
45516,L284425,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I know, but --"
45517,L284424,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!"
45518,L284423,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!"
45519,L284422,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!"
45520,L284421,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?"
45521,L284420,u1357,m90,BURNS,Where do you think you're going?
45522,L284410,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I know. Where is he, I said."
45523,L284409,u1364,m90,HILDY,She jumped out of the window.
45524,L284408,u1357,m90,BURNS,Yes. Where is he?
45525,L284407,u1364,m90,HILDY,Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
45526,L284079,u1357,m90,BURNS,Hold on a minute.
45527,L284078,u1364,m90,HILDY,"It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band."
45528,L284077,u1357,m90,BURNS,"That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes."
45529,L284076,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover."
45530,L284075,u1357,m90,BURNS,"No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?"
45531,L284074,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!"
45532,L284073,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --"
45533,L284072,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!"
45534,L284071,u1364,m90,HILDY,Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
45535,L284070,u1357,m90,BURNS,You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
45536,L284069,u1364,m90,HILDY,Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
45537,L284068,u1357,m90,BURNS,Never mind that. What's the story?
45538,L284067,u1364,m90,HILDY,It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
45539,L284066,u1357,m90,BURNS,Exclusive? That's great.
45540,L283683,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified."
45541,L283682,u1357,m90,BURNS,All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
45542,L283681,u1364,m90,HILDY,Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
45543,L283680,u1357,m90,BURNS,What do you think I am -- a crook?
45544,L283677,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?"
45545,L283676,u1357,m90,BURNS,What tricks would I pull?
45546,L283675,u1364,m90,HILDY,"You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!"
45547,L283674,u1357,m90,BURNS,Now you're talking!
45548,L283666,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?"
45549,L283665,u1364,m90,HILDY,We're not interested.
45550,L283664,u1357,m90,BURNS,"All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition."
45551,L283663,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors."
45552,L283662,u1357,m90,BURNS,What do you mean?
45553,L283661,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's."
45554,L283660,u1357,m90,BURNS,"What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?"
45555,L283659,u1364,m90,HILDY,"What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!"
45556,L283658,u1357,m90,BURNS,"How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!"
45557,L283657,u1357,m90,BURNS,You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
45558,L283656,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!"
45559,L283655,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --"
45560,L283654,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same."
45561,L283644,u1357,m90,BURNS,Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
45562,L283643,u1364,m90,HILDY,The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
45563,L283642,u1357,m90,BURNS,Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
45564,L283641,u1364,m90,HILDY,"If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?"
45565,L283638,u1357,m90,BURNS,So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
45566,L283637,u1364,m90,HILDY,You said it.
45567,L283636,u1357,m90,BURNS,"His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation."
45568,L283635,u1364,m90,HILDY,What now?
45569,L283615,u1364,m90,HILDY,Thank you.
45570,L283614,u1357,m90,BURNS,Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
45571,L283594,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home."
45572,L283593,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I might have, Walter, but you were never there."
45573,L283592,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you."
45574,L283562,u1357,m90,BURNS,How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
45575,L283561,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling."
45576,L283530,u1357,m90,BURNS,Thanks.
45577,L283529,u1364,m90,HILDY,Allow me.
45578,L283527,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh, I'm sorry."
45579,L283526,u1364,m90,HILDY,"And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!"
45580,L283525,u1357,m90,BURNS,What for?
45581,L283524,u1364,m90,HILDY,And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
45582,L283523,u1357,m90,BURNS,No kidding?
45583,L283522,u1364,m90,HILDY,"You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me."
45584,L283520,u1357,m90,BURNS,Nothing personal. I was just asking.
45585,L283519,u1364,m90,HILDY,Now you got me.
45586,L283518,u1357,m90,BURNS,Then what does he want with you?
45587,L283517,u1364,m90,HILDY,Better.
45588,L283516,u1357,m90,BURNS,"All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?"
45589,L283515,u1364,m90,HILDY,Afraid? I should say not!
45590,L283514,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You're not afraid, are you?"
45591,L283513,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good."
45592,L283512,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Say, could I meet him?"
45593,L283511,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now."
45594,L283510,u1357,m90,BURNS,Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
45595,L283509,u1364,m90,HILDY,Thanks...
45596,L283508,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy."
45597,L283507,u1364,m90,HILDY,"The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time."
45598,L283506,u1357,m90,BURNS,Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
45599,L283505,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin."
45600,L283504,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?"
45601,L283503,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children."
45602,L283502,u1357,m90,BURNS,"He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?"
45603,L283501,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman."
45604,L283500,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies."
45605,L283499,u1364,m90,HILDY,"It's a good, honest business, isn't it?"
45606,L283498,u1357,m90,BURNS,The insurance business?
45607,L283497,u1364,m90,HILDY,He's in the insurance business.
45608,L283496,u1357,m90,BURNS,What's his line?
45609,L283495,u1364,m90,HILDY,Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
45610,L283494,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Bermuda... Rich, eh?"
45611,L283493,u1364,m90,HILDY,Bermuda.
45612,L283492,u1357,m90,BURNS,Where'd you meet this man?
45613,L283491,u1364,m90,HILDY,"A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through."
45614,L283490,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you."
45615,L283489,u1364,m90,HILDY,That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
45616,L283488,u1357,m90,BURNS,Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
45617,L283487,u1364,m90,HILDY,"You can't sell me that, Walter."
45618,L283486,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business."
45619,L283485,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through."
45620,L283483,u1364,m90,HILDY,Look at this!
45621,L283482,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --"
45622,L283481,u1364,m90,HILDY,I'm not working for any other paper!
45623,L283480,u1357,m90,BURNS,Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
45624,L283479,u1364,m90,HILDY,Please! Will you just --
45625,L283478,u1357,m90,BURNS,"All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!"
45626,L283477,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --"
45627,L283476,u1357,m90,BURNS,"If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week."
45628,L283475,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Get away, Svengali."
45629,L283474,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper."
45630,L283473,u1364,m90,HILDY,"That's what I'm afraid of. ""Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"""
45631,L283472,u1357,m90,BURNS,"It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be."
45632,L283471,u1364,m90,HILDY,Keep away --
45633,L283470,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You've got to help me, Hildy."
45634,L283469,u1364,m90,HILDY,No!
45635,L283468,u1357,m90,BURNS,"There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!"
45636,L283467,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, haven't you got anybody else?"
45637,L283466,u1357,m90,BURNS,I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
45638,L283465,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?"
45639,L283464,u1357,m90,BURNS,Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
45640,L283463,u1364,m90,HILDY,Dead?
45641,L283462,u1357,m90,BURNS,Sweeney.
45642,L283461,u1364,m90,HILDY,What's the matter?
45643,L283460,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day."
45644,L283457,u1364,m90,HILDY,You -- you --
45645,L283456,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!"
45646,L283455,u1364,m90,HILDY,I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
45647,L283454,u1357,m90,BURNS,It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
45648,L283453,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter."
45649,L283452,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us."
45650,L283451,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Listen, Walter --"
45651,L283450,u1357,m90,BURNS,Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
45652,L283449,u1364,m90,HILDY,You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
45653,L283448,u1357,m90,BURNS,What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
45654,L283447,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I know, Walter, but I --"
45655,L283446,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --"
45656,L283445,u1364,m90,HILDY,You bet I've got a better offer.
45657,L283444,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You've had a better offer, eh?"
45658,L283443,u1364,m90,HILDY,That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
45659,L283442,u1357,m90,BURNS,You mean you're not coming back to work here?
45660,L283441,u1364,m90,HILDY,Just what I said. That's what I --
45661,L283440,u1357,m90,BURNS,What do you mean by that?
45662,L283439,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss."
45663,L283438,u1357,m90,BURNS,Sure you can. Come on.
45664,L283437,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, I can't."
45665,L283436,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You can break it, can't you?"
45666,L283435,u1364,m90,HILDY,I have a lunch date. I just want --
45667,L283434,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything."
45668,L283433,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?"
45669,L283432,u1357,m90,BURNS,I haven't any hard feelings.
45670,L283431,u1364,m90,HILDY,What?!!
45671,L283430,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again."
45672,L283429,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --"
45673,L283428,u1357,m90,BURNS,Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
45674,L283427,u1364,m90,HILDY,"All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?"
45675,L283426,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did."
45676,L283423,u1364,m90,HILDY,What home?
45677,L283422,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up."
45678,L283421,u1364,m90,HILDY,"A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it."
45679,L283420,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry."
45680,L283419,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?"
45681,L283418,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Now, that's a nice thing to say."
45682,L283417,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker."
45683,L283416,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change."
45684,L283415,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for."
45685,L283414,u1357,m90,BURNS,Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
45686,L283413,u1364,m90,HILDY,Done what?
45687,L283412,u1357,m90,BURNS,"You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it."
45688,L283411,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you."
45689,L283410,u1357,m90,BURNS,I notice you still remember it.
45690,L283409,u1364,m90,HILDY,"You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  ""-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"""
45691,L283407,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --"
45692,L283406,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now."
45693,L283405,u1357,m90,BURNS,Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
45694,L283404,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me."
45695,L283403,u1357,m90,BURNS,You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
45696,L283402,u1364,m90,HILDY,How long is what?
45697,L283377,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?"
45698,L283376,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Hello, Hildy!"
45699,L283375,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife."
45700,L283374,u1357,m90,BURNS,What do you want?
45701,L284771,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,Let me out! Let me out of here!
45702,L284770,u1357,m90,BURNS,You grey-haired old Judas!
45703,L284769,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"
45704,L284754,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
45705,L284753,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail."
45706,L284743,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,You know you did!
45707,L284742,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Are you referring to me, Madam?"
45708,L284415,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,What's that -- what's that?
45709,L284414,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way."
45710,L284643,u1366,m90,LOUIE,I always have both.
45711,L284642,u1357,m90,BURNS,I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
45712,L284641,u1366,m90,LOUIE,"Sure, boss."
45713,L284640,u1357,m90,BURNS,You got plenty of money?
45714,L284639,u1366,m90,LOUIE,You know me. The shirt off my back.
45715,L284638,u1357,m90,BURNS,Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
45716,L284637,u1366,m90,LOUIE,Who do you want?
45717,L284636,u1357,m90,BURNS,Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
45718,L284635,u1366,m90,LOUIE,"Anything you want, Boss."
45719,L284618,u1366,m90,LOUIE,Western an' Thirty-fourth.
45720,L284617,u1357,m90,BURNS,You stay here. I'll find out everything.
45721,L284604,u1366,m90,LOUIE,I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
45722,L284603,u1357,m90,BURNS,Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
45723,L284602,u1366,m90,LOUIE,"What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street."
45724,L284601,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!"
45725,L284589,u1357,m90,BURNS,Take that mush out of your mouth!
45726,L284588,u1366,m90,LOUIE,Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
45727,L283778,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around."
45728,L283777,u1359,m90,DUFFY,"Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!"
45729,L283392,u1357,m90,BURNS,"Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head."
45730,L283391,u1359,m90,DUFFY,Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
45731,L283388,u1357,m90,BURNS,They can't do that to me!
45732,L283387,u1359,m90,DUFFY,He's on my phone. He just called me.
45733,L283386,u1357,m90,BURNS,You're crazy. Where's Mac?
45734,L283385,u1359,m90,DUFFY,And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
45735,L283384,u1357,m90,BURNS,What?
45736,L283383,u1359,m90,DUFFY,"Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!"
45737,L283382,u1357,m90,BURNS,"I'm busy, Duffy."
45738,L283381,u1359,m90,DUFFY,Walter!
45739,L284036,u1364,m90,HILDY,First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
45740,L284035,u1358,m90,COOLEY,Let's see the money.
45741,L284034,u1358,m90,COOLEY,It's a deal. Let me up.
45742,L284033,u1364,m90,HILDY,Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
45743,L284032,u1358,m90,COOLEY,How much?
45744,L284031,u1364,m90,HILDY,A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
45745,L284030,u1358,m90,COOLEY,I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
45746,L284029,u1364,m90,HILDY,"There's money in it, Cooley."
45747,L284028,u1358,m90,COOLEY,"Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --"
45748,L284027,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Cooley, I want to talk to you."
45749,L283813,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry."
45750,L283812,u1358,m90,COOLEY,I think it is.
45751,L283811,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?"
45752,L283810,u1358,m90,COOLEY,"No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over."
45753,L283809,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?"
45754,L283808,u1358,m90,COOLEY,"Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?"
45755,L283998,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen."
45756,L283997,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I don't know --
45757,L283939,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"Yes, I suppose so. It all helps."
45758,L283938,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
45759,L283937,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though."
45760,L283936,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor."
45761,L283935,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
45762,L283934,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me."
45763,L283933,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?"
45764,L283932,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Me, too."
45765,L283931,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,They're always after me for interviews.
45766,L283930,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,You said it!
45767,L283929,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization."
45768,L284003,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,Point the gun at me!
45769,L284002,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Well, it wasn't exactly that way --"
45770,L284001,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me."
45771,L284000,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Yes, sir."
45772,L283999,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?"
45773,L283945,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything."
45774,L283944,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?"
45775,L283943,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe."
45776,L283942,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?"
45777,L283941,u1360,m90,EGELHOFFER,"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?"
45778,L283940,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Are you gentlemen all through with me?
45779,L284358,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!"
45780,L284357,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Better let us in on it, Mollie."
45781,L284350,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
45782,L284349,u1364,m90,HILDY,A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
45783,L284328,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Okay.  Up you go, Mollie."
45784,L284327,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Give me a hand with her, will you?"
45785,L284326,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,She looks as though she's going to come to.
45786,L284325,u1364,m90,HILDY,Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
45787,L284324,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
45788,L284322,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?"
45789,L284321,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know."
45790,L284316,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!"
45791,L284315,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Hey!
45792,L284310,u1364,m90,HILDY,All right -- all right!
45793,L284309,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Open up there, will you!"
45794,L284304,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!"
45795,L284303,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Who locked the door?
45796,L283730,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Beats king up.
45797,L283729,u1364,m90,HILDY,Three bullets! Any good?
45798,L283728,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,I call. What you got?
45799,L283714,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I know, I just want to give him a thrill."
45800,L283713,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk."
45801,L283707,u1364,m90,HILDY,Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
45802,L283706,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Well, that about covers everything."
45803,L284793,u1372,m90,MURPHY,I'll have it in a minute.
45804,L284792,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Hold the phone!
45805,L284687,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!"
45806,L284686,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree."
45807,L284394,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Where is he, before we beat it out of you?"
45808,L284393,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
45809,L284392,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Come on, you! Before we slap you down."
45810,L284360,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both."
45811,L284359,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story."
45812,L284354,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?"
45813,L284353,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?"
45814,L284107,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Who engineered this getaway?
45815,L284106,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"What's the dope, Sheriff?"
45816,L284105,u1372,m90,MURPHY,So have we!
45817,L284043,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Call you back.
45818,L284042,u1372,m90,MURPHY,The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
45819,L284041,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it."
45820,L283923,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
45821,L283922,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Boy, did you see her go?"
45822,L283911,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,What's the use? I can't win a pot.
45823,L283910,u1372,m90,MURPHY,You guys wanna play some more poker?
45824,L283875,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter."
45825,L283874,u1372,m90,MURPHY,She says she's gonna write fiction.
45826,L283869,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
45827,L283868,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around."
45828,L283760,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"What have you got, Hildy?"
45829,L283759,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'"
45830,L283752,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!"
45831,L283751,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
45832,L283750,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
45833,L283749,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk."
45834,L284672,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Probably goin' out to get Williams.
45835,L284671,u1369,m90,MCCUE,We know what you're up to.
45836,L284389,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Now, where is he?"
45837,L284388,u1369,m90,MCCUE,You ain't gettin' out o' here!
45838,L284336,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back."
45839,L284335,u1369,m90,MCCUE,What a chase!
45840,L284008,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"So long, Hildy."
45841,L284007,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,"Goodbye, Yonson."
45842,L283702,u1361,m90,ENDICOTT,Three sixes. Is that any good?
45843,L283701,u1369,m90,MCCUE,I'll call.
45844,L283611,u1362,m90,GUS,"Good coffee, isn't it?"
45845,L283610,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Gus, this --"
45846,L283606,u1362,m90,GUS,That's all right.
45847,L283605,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped."
45848,L283575,u1362,m90,GUS,"Just coffee.  And you, sir?"
45849,L283574,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No -- just coffee, Gus."
45850,L283573,u1364,m90,HILDY,I guess so.
45851,L283572,u1362,m90,GUS,"Little rum in yours, too?"
45852,L283571,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee."
45853,L283567,u1362,m90,GUS,I can't complain.
45854,L283566,u1364,m90,HILDY,"How's everything, Gus?"
45855,L284788,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
45856,L284787,u1364,m90,HILDY,That's murder!
45857,L284768,u1364,m90,HILDY,He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
45858,L284767,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
45859,L284766,u1364,m90,HILDY,He's harmless.
45860,L284712,u1364,m90,HILDY,With a bag of marshmallows.
45861,L284711,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,What?
45862,L284710,u1364,m90,HILDY,He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
45863,L284699,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Not this gun!
45864,L284698,u1364,m90,HILDY,I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
45865,L284697,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Where'd you get this?
45866,L284690,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk."
45867,L284689,u1364,m90,HILDY,What do I know about Williams?
45868,L284688,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?"
45869,L284679,u1364,m90,HILDY,Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
45870,L284678,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
45871,L284677,u1364,m90,HILDY,You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
45872,L284676,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on."
45873,L284675,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident."
45874,L284670,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
45875,L284669,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law."
45876,L284666,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Hold her, boys!"
45877,L284665,u1364,m90,HILDY,Take your paws off me!
45878,L284662,u1364,m90,HILDY,Let go o' me. What's the idea?
45879,L284661,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Just a minute, Johnson!"
45880,L283865,u1364,m90,HILDY,"That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later."
45881,L283864,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy."
45882,L283863,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight."
45883,L283858,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?"
45884,L283857,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --"
45885,L283856,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?"
45886,L283855,u1364,m90,HILDY,"All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say."
45887,L283854,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
45888,L283853,u1364,m90,HILDY,Same way you did.  Through that gate.
45889,L284111,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
45890,L284110,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Where is he?
45891,L284054,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --"
45892,L284053,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,After all I've done for you --
45893,L284052,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --"
45894,L284051,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,A fine fair-weather friend you are!
45895,L284050,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
45896,L284049,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,What went off?
45897,L284048,u1372,m90,MURPHY,This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
45898,L284047,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am."
45899,L284220,u1373,m90,PINKUS,"That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be."
45900,L284219,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Just one second --
45901,L284197,u1373,m90,PINKUS,"No, I couldn't do that."
45902,L284196,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference."
45903,L284167,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Yeah. But I --
45904,L284166,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!"
45905,L284158,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Earl Williams. The reprieve.
45906,L284157,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,For who?
45907,L284152,u1373,m90,PINKUS,"You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff."
45908,L284151,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
45909,L284887,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve."
45910,L284886,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,And so do I!
45911,L284870,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
45912,L284869,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle."
45913,L284868,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I was just going to!
45914,L284867,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary."
45915,L284853,u1368,m90,MAYOR,I never saw him before!
45916,L284852,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,That's a lie!!
45917,L284848,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
45918,L284847,u1368,m90,MAYOR,You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
45919,L284841,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Throw him out, Frank."
45920,L284840,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Who is this man?
45921,L284821,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
45922,L284820,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
45923,L284819,u1368,m90,MAYOR,A sight for sore eyes!
45924,L284818,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?"
45925,L284817,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you."
45926,L284230,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
45927,L284229,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse."
45928,L284228,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do."
45929,L284227,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you."
45930,L284226,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out."
45931,L284225,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Shoot to kill, I said."
45932,L284224,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,What?
45933,L284223,u1368,m90,MAYOR,All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
45934,L284222,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Just -- one -- second!
45935,L284221,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"We'll fix that, too."
45936,L284207,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Now what do you say?
45937,L284206,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!"
45938,L284188,u1368,m90,MAYOR,How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
45939,L284187,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,No -- don't out me off.
45940,L284180,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Cover up that transmitter!
45941,L284179,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I did.  Hold the wire.
45942,L284178,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Tell 'em to hold the wire.
45943,L284177,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
45944,L284176,u1368,m90,MAYOR,What is it?
45945,L284175,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!"
45946,L284174,u1368,m90,MAYOR,And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
45947,L284173,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --"
45948,L284172,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
45949,L284171,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
45950,L284170,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
45951,L284169,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,An attempt to ruin us!
45952,L284168,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Pure politics!
45953,L284161,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?"
45954,L284160,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
45955,L284146,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away."
45956,L284145,u1368,m90,MAYOR,I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
45957,L284144,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --"
45958,L284143,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!"
45959,L284142,u1368,m90,MAYOR,We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
45960,L284141,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
45961,L284139,u1368,m90,MAYOR,If there was any way out...
45962,L284138,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister."
45963,L284137,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete."
45964,L284136,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature."
45965,L284135,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side."
45966,L284134,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,Fred!
45967,L284133,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make."
45968,L284132,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,What do you mean -- through?
45969,L284131,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Pete, you're through!"
45970,L284130,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years."
45971,L284129,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
45972,L284128,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
45973,L284127,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
45974,L284126,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies."
45975,L284116,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --"
45976,L284115,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
45977,L284114,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Did you actually give Williams that gun?
45978,L284113,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after."
45979,L284112,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Pete, I want to talk to you!"
45980,L284798,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Go on -- shoot me!
45981,L284797,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Got you, Williams!"
45982,L283995,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor."
45983,L283994,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued."
45984,L283862,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?"
45985,L283861,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,I won't.
45986,L283860,u1363,m90,HARTMAN,"That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?"
45987,L283859,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Fine, thanks, Sheriff."
45988,L283959,u1365,m90,LIEUTENANT,"Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam."
45989,L283958,u1364,m90,HILDY,You'll take fifty and like it!
45990,L283957,u1365,m90,LIEUTENANT,Five hundred dollars.
45991,L283956,u1364,m90,HILDY,"You can let him out on bail, can't you?"
45992,L283955,u1365,m90,LIEUTENANT,"Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out."
45993,L283954,u1364,m90,HILDY,All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
45994,L283953,u1365,m90,LIEUTENANT,I can't.
45995,L283952,u1364,m90,HILDY,Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
45996,L283951,u1365,m90,LIEUTENANT,"Now, Hildy --"
45997,L283950,u1364,m90,HILDY,And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
45998,L283949,u1365,m90,LIEUTENANT,"But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him."
45999,L283948,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Let him out of here, Lieutenant."
46000,L284954,u1366,m90,LOUIE,"All right, Judge."
46001,L284953,u1364,m90,HILDY,Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!
46002,L284600,u1366,m90,LOUIE,Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
46003,L284599,u1364,m90,HILDY,"-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?"
46004,L284598,u1366,m90,LOUIE,Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
46005,L284597,u1364,m90,HILDY,What did you do with her?
46006,L284596,u1366,m90,LOUIE,I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
46007,L284593,u1364,m90,HILDY,Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
46008,L284592,u1366,m90,LOUIE,We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
46009,L284591,u1366,m90,LOUIE,I'm telling you!
46010,L284590,u1364,m90,HILDY,Where's the old lady?
46011,L284417,u1366,m90,LOUIE,My name is Louis Peluso.
46012,L284416,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!"
46013,L283379,u1364,m90,HILDY,Editorials?
46014,L283378,u1366,m90,LOUIE,"Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man."
46015,L284059,u1376,m90,WILSON,I'll go right after it.
46016,L284058,u1364,m90,HILDY,There goes another scrub lady.
46017,L283920,u1364,m90,HILDY,Give me that!
46018,L283919,u1376,m90,WILSON,"Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?"
46019,L283918,u1364,m90,HILDY,Who is it?
46020,L283917,u1376,m90,WILSON,"Phone for you, Hildy."
46021,L283916,u1364,m90,HILDY,Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
46022,L284340,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
46023,L284339,u1364,m90,HILDY,Any news?
46024,L283992,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!"
46025,L283991,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,"Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here."
46026,L283985,u1364,m90,HILDY,"This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean ""dear."" That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important."
46027,L283984,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,"Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily."
46028,L283983,u1364,m90,HILDY,"It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please."
46029,L283796,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,What's the matter? Getting yellow?
46030,L283795,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more."
46031,L284692,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"What's the use of fighting, Hildy?"
46032,L284691,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Look out, you --"
46033,L284352,u1364,m90,HILDY,"What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end."
46034,L284351,u1369,m90,MCCUE,Okay.  Forget it.
46035,L284095,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --"
46036,L284094,u1364,m90,HILDY,"If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back."
46037,L284092,u1364,m90,HILDY,No -- what?
46038,L284091,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Did you get that, Hildy?"
46039,L284089,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I thought so, too."
46040,L284088,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone."
46041,L283803,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now."
46042,L283802,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?"
46043,L283801,u1364,m90,HILDY,"But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years."
46044,L283800,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?"
46045,L283793,u1364,m90,HILDY,Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
46046,L283792,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?"
46047,L283791,u1364,m90,HILDY,I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
46048,L283727,u1364,m90,HILDY,And up a dime.
46049,L283726,u1369,m90,MCCUE,You fight it cut.
46050,L284251,u1367,m90,LOUIS,"What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!"
46051,L284250,u1364,m90,HILDY,No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
46052,L284249,u1367,m90,LOUIS,I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
46053,L284248,u1364,m90,HILDY,You know it is!
46054,L284247,u1367,m90,LOUIS,"Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?"
46055,L284246,u1364,m90,HILDY,"None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!"
46056,L284245,u1367,m90,LOUIS,Huh?
46057,L284244,u1364,m90,HILDY,"So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?"
46058,L284243,u1367,m90,LOUIS,"Thanks. So long, Hildy!"
46059,L284242,u1364,m90,HILDY,Here!
46060,L284241,u1367,m90,LOUIS,Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
46061,L284240,u1364,m90,HILDY,Where's the money?
46062,L284239,u1367,m90,LOUIS,First you got to sign a receipt.
46063,L284238,u1364,m90,HILDY,Come on with that money!
46064,L284237,u1367,m90,LOUIS,"All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?"
46065,L284236,u1364,m90,HILDY,Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
46066,L284235,u1367,m90,LOUIS,"Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?"
46067,L284234,u1364,m90,HILDY,Have you got my dough?
46068,L284757,u1364,m90,HILDY,Mother!
46069,L284756,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Hiding him where?
46070,L284334,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
46071,L284333,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could."
46072,L284332,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Hildy, I thought you were gone --"
46073,L284061,u1364,m90,HILDY,From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
46074,L284060,u1372,m90,MURPHY,Any dope yet on how he got out?
46075,L283763,u1364,m90,HILDY,'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
46076,L283762,u1372,m90,MURPHY,That's good.
46077,L283761,u1364,m90,HILDY,Kings and sixes.
46078,L284735,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me."
46079,L284734,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,That man there!
46080,L284733,u1364,m90,HILDY,Mother!
46081,L284371,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,"I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me."
46082,L284370,u1364,m90,HILDY,I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
46083,L284365,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
46084,L284364,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --"
46085,L284363,u1371,m90,MRS. BALDWIN,Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
46086,L284362,u1364,m90,HILDY,Mother!
46087,L284308,u1364,m90,HILDY,We'll get you out in ten minutes.
46088,L284307,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,What good'll it do?
46089,L284299,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
46090,L284298,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back."
46091,L284294,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?"
46092,L284293,u1364,m90,HILDY,"How'd you get here, Earl?"
46093,L284292,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about."
46094,L284291,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Quiet, Mollie, quiet!"
46095,L284274,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Sure I do, Earl."
46096,L284273,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?"
46097,L284272,u1364,m90,HILDY,Don't talk too loud.
46098,L284270,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Well, maybe you think I could!"
46099,L284269,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this."
46100,L284268,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Earl, you must never do that again."
46101,L284266,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Keep away!
46102,L284265,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either."
46103,L284264,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
46104,L284263,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview."
46105,L284262,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone."
46106,L284261,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody."
46107,L284260,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here."
46108,L284259,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Don't move!
46109,L284258,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?"
46110,L284257,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
46111,L284256,u1364,m90,HILDY,"You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your ""Production for Use""."
46112,L284255,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Put down that gun, Earl."
46113,L284254,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
46114,L283867,u1364,m90,HILDY,"I won't, Earl."
46115,L283866,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Don't forget about production for use.
46116,L283849,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
46117,L283848,u1364,m90,HILDY,Isn't that her picture?
46118,L283847,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
46119,L283846,u1364,m90,HILDY,"No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?"
46120,L283845,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"There's nothing crazy about that, is there?"
46121,L283844,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Very simple, Earl."
46122,L283843,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?"
46123,L283842,u1364,m90,HILDY,Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
46124,L283841,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course."
46125,L283838,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl."
46126,L283837,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?"
46127,L283836,u1364,m90,HILDY,"""Production for use only."" Well, maybe that's the answer."
46128,L283835,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
46129,L283834,u1364,m90,HILDY,"How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?"
46130,L283833,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things."
46131,L283832,u1364,m90,HILDY,"What are your beliefs, Earl?"
46132,L283831,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
46133,L283830,u1364,m90,HILDY,You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
46134,L283829,u1375,m90,WILLIAMS,"I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else."
46135,L284344,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,"Yeah, I'm feelin' fine."
46136,L284343,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Are you all right, now?"
46137,L284320,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Shut up, you!"
46138,L284319,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,Hey --
46139,L284318,u1364,m90,HILDY,Never mind! Just play dead.
46140,L284317,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,What's the idea?
46141,L284314,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
46142,L284313,u1364,m90,HILDY,I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
46143,L284302,u1364,m90,HILDY,Ssh!
46144,L284301,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,They'll get him! They'll get him!
46145,L284289,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,There's somethin' funny going on around here.
46146,L284288,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Quiet, Mollie!"
46147,L284287,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,What's that?
46148,L284286,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,What do you mean?
46149,L284285,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!"
46150,L284284,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
46151,L284283,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Wait a minute, Mollie."
46152,L284282,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,Where are they gone? You know where they are?
46153,L283909,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
46154,L283908,u1364,m90,HILDY,"They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way."
46155,L283907,u1370,m90,MOLLIE,They're not human!
46156,L283906,u1364,m90,HILDY,"Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you."
46157,L284879,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --"
46158,L284878,u1373,m90,PINKUS,She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
46159,L284877,u1368,m90,MAYOR,A very fine-looking women.
46160,L284876,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Here's the picture of my wife.
46161,L284844,u1368,m90,MAYOR,You're insane!
46162,L284843,u1373,m90,PINKUS,They wouldn't take it.
46163,L284834,u1373,m90,PINKUS,You can't bribe me!
46164,L284833,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Get out of here!
46165,L284218,u1368,m90,MAYOR,No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
46166,L284217,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Is it hard?
46167,L284216,u1368,m90,MAYOR,I'll explain it tomorrow!
46168,L284215,u1373,m90,PINKUS,You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
46169,L284213,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account."
46170,L284212,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Pinkus.
46171,L284211,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
46172,L284210,u1373,m90,PINKUS,But how do I know...?
46173,L284209,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you."
46174,L284208,u1373,m90,PINKUS,This puts me in a peculiar hole.
46175,L284205,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Yeah?
46176,L284204,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!"
46177,L284203,u1373,m90,PINKUS,"I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade."
46178,L284202,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"For heaven's sake, why not?"
46179,L284201,u1373,m90,PINKUS,"No, I don't think so."
46180,L284200,u1368,m90,MAYOR,But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
46181,L284199,u1373,m90,PINKUS,"I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country."
46182,L284198,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Why not?
46183,L284195,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Yes, yes!"
46184,L284194,u1373,m90,PINKUS,You mean here in the city?
46185,L284193,u1368,m90,MAYOR,The City Sealer's office!
46186,L284192,u1373,m90,PINKUS,The what?
46187,L284191,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office."
46188,L284190,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Who do you think!
46189,L284189,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Who? Me?
46190,L284186,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Forty dollars.
46191,L284185,u1368,m90,MAYOR,How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
46192,L284184,u1373,m90,PINKUS,Huh?
46193,L284183,u1368,m90,MAYOR,How much do you make a week?
46194,L284182,u1373,m90,PINKUS,"Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?"
46195,L284181,u1368,m90,MAYOR,"Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?"
46196,L284165,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
46197,L284164,u1373,m90,PINKUS,You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
46198,L284163,u1368,m90,MAYOR,Get the Governor on the phone!
46199,L284162,u1373,m90,PINKUS,They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
46200,L284156,u1373,m90,PINKUS,The reprieve for Earl Williams.
46201,L284155,u1368,m90,MAYOR,What's from the Governor?
46202,L284154,u1373,m90,PINKUS,I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
46203,L284153,u1368,m90,MAYOR,What do you want?
46204,L284806,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --"
46205,L284805,u1369,m90,MCCUE,Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
46206,L284664,u1372,m90,MURPHY,We want to see you.
46207,L284663,u1369,m90,MCCUE,What's your hurry?
46208,L284660,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Say, Hildy..."
46209,L284659,u1372,m90,MURPHY,There she is!
46210,L284404,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Come on, fellas."
46211,L284403,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Get the cops, somebody."
46212,L284346,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?"
46213,L284345,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life."
46214,L284023,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Look out where you're aiming, will you?"
46215,L284022,u1369,m90,MCCUE,Look out!
46216,L283878,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"Hello, Mollie."
46217,L283877,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy."
46218,L283709,u1369,m90,MCCUE,"It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!"
46219,L283708,u1372,m90,MURPHY,"If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes."
46220,L284674,u1376,m90,WILSON,She and Mollie were talking.
46221,L284673,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,The door was locked.
46222,L283915,u1376,m90,WILSON,Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
46223,L283914,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,What's he want?
46224,L283913,u1376,m90,WILSON,Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
46225,L283912,u1376,m90,WILSON,"Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right."
46226,L283871,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,I give that marriage six months.
46227,L283870,u1376,m90,WILSON,Baldwin -- his name is.
46228,L283711,u1374,m90,SCHWARTZ,"His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all."
46229,L283710,u1376,m90,WILSON,"Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz."
46230,L285660,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,Apparently so.
46231,L285659,u1377,m91,BILL,"Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?"
46232,L285658,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
46233,L285657,u1377,m91,BILL,It's true.
46234,L285652,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk."
46235,L285651,u1377,m91,BILL,With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
46236,L285650,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,Only till they get you into the local school.
46237,L285649,u1377,m91,BILL,I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
46238,L285648,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school."
46239,L285627,u1377,m91,BILL,"Very well, Grandpa."
46240,L285626,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,Give him the you-know-what.
46241,L285586,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil..."
46242,L285585,u1377,m91,BILL,"But Grandpa, you said..."
46243,L285584,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"This is going too far, young man."
46244,L285579,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
46245,L285578,u1377,m91,BILL,Why?
46246,L285577,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?"
46247,L285576,u1377,m91,BILL,"No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn."
46248,L285575,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another."
46249,L285574,u1377,m91,BILL,I know.
46250,L285573,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,That was a googly!
46251,L285552,u1377,m91,BILL,"I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off."
46252,L285551,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,Never let a rat creep up on you.
46253,L285538,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it."
46254,L285537,u1377,m91,BILL,Can I try?
46255,L285454,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
46256,L285453,u1377,m91,BILL,Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
46257,L285452,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,What's that?
46258,L285299,u1386,m91,ROGER,"They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork."
46259,L285298,u1377,m91,BILL,Won't they have maps?
46260,L285297,u1386,m91,ROGER,"They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way."
46261,L285294,u1386,m91,ROGER,OK. You're in.
46262,L285293,u1377,m91,BILL,"Bugger off, you bloody sod."
46263,L285292,u1386,m91,ROGER,"Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod."
46264,L285291,u1377,m91,BILL,Bloody.
46265,L285290,u1386,m91,ROGER,Bloody.
46266,L285289,u1377,m91,BILL,Sod.
46267,L285288,u1386,m91,ROGER,Sod.
46268,L285287,u1377,m91,BILL,Bugger off.
46269,L285286,u1386,m91,ROGER,"That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off."
46270,L285283,u1377,m91,BILL,I only know one.
46271,L285282,u1386,m91,ROGER,Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
46272,L285281,u1386,m91,ROGER,Say them.
46273,L285280,u1377,m91,BILL,Yes.
46274,L285279,u1386,m91,ROGER,Do you know any swear words?
46275,L285278,u1377,m91,BILL,I don't mind.
46276,L285277,u1386,m91,ROGER,You want to join our gang?
46277,L285274,u1386,m91,ROGER,They're not.
46278,L285273,u1377,m91,BILL,"My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. ""Boys are going missing all the time."""
46279,L285272,u1386,m91,ROGER,Who told you that?
46280,L285271,u1377,m91,BILL,The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
46281,L285270,u1386,m91,ROGER,What's that?
46282,L285269,u1377,m91,BILL,I know a secret.
46283,L285268,u1386,m91,ROGER,"Yes, you was. Make him talk."
46284,L285267,u1377,m91,BILL,I never was.
46285,L285262,u1377,m91,BILL,Looking for shrapnel.
46286,L285261,u1386,m91,ROGER,What are you doing here? This is our territory
46287,L285226,u1386,m91,ROGER,"Yes, she did, didn't she?"
46288,L285225,u1377,m91,BILL,"No, she didn't."

46290,L285430,u1387,m91,SUE,Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
46291,L285429,u1377,m91,BILL,Pauline.
46292,L285428,u1387,m91,SUE,Who with?
46293,L285427,u1377,m91,BILL,It's easy. I've done it.
46294,L285426,u1387,m91,SUE,"I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about."
46295,L285377,u1387,m91,SUE,We thought it was poison.
46296,L285376,u1377,m91,BILL,"Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam."
46297,L285260,u1377,m91,BILL,Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
46298,L285259,u1387,m91,SUE,Tell them about Pauline's mum.
46299,L285234,u1377,m91,BILL,You do it. You're a girl.

46301,L285232,u1377,m91,BILL,Go and ask her if she wants to play.
46302,L285093,u1377,m91,BILL,Could.
46303,L285092,u1387,m91,SUE,You couldn't.
46304,L285091,u1377,m91,BILL,Would.
46305,L285090,u1387,m91,SUE,You wouldn't.
46306,L285089,u1377,m91,BILL,"It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home."
46307,L285088,u1387,m91,SUE,He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
46308,L285647,u1380,m91,DAWN,"Thank you Billy, from the baby and me."
46309,L285646,u1377,m91,BILL,"Well, for the baby, really."
46310,L285645,u1380,m91,DAWN,"You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?"
46311,L285361,u1380,m91,DAWN,That's not the point.
46312,L285360,u1377,m91,BILL,You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
46313,L285359,u1380,m91,DAWN,"Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic."
46314,L285214,u1377,m91,BILL,It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
46315,L285213,u1380,m91,DAWN,I'm starting my own collection.
46316,L285212,u1377,m91,BILL,Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
46317,L285198,u1377,m91,BILL,It's not the same.
46318,L285197,u1380,m91,DAWN,They've got the real thing outside.
46319,L285196,u1377,m91,BILL,Can't we just see the end?
46320,L285161,u1377,m91,BILL,...and six...
46321,L285160,u1380,m91,DAWN,Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.

46323,L285158,u1380,m91,DAWN,The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
46324,L285027,u1377,m91,BILL,It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
46325,L285026,u1380,m91,DAWN,You're the biggest fibber.
46326,L284999,u1380,m91,DAWN,He's the worst liar.
46327,L284998,u1377,m91,BILL,I did see them. I did.
46328,L285441,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we."
46329,L285440,u1377,m91,BILL,"You said that last year, Dad."
46330,L285113,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son."
46331,L285112,u1377,m91,BILL,It's like telling fibs.
46332,L285111,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this."
46333,L285068,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes."
46334,L285067,u1377,m91,BILL,"But Dad, It's the News."
46335,L285012,u1379,m91,CLIVE,The sodding water table.
46336,L285011,u1377,m91,BILL,Crocodiles! Aah!
46337,L285484,u1384,m91,MAC,"We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?"
46338,L285483,u1377,m91,BILL,Who pays for them?
46339,L285482,u1384,m91,MAC,"They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8."
46340,L285481,u1377,m91,BILL,Wow!
46341,L285480,u1384,m91,MAC,"Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have."
46342,L285479,u1377,m91,BILL,What's that?
46343,L285464,u1378,m91,BRUCE,Please yourself.
46344,L285463,u1380,m91,DAWN,You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
46345,L285462,u1378,m91,BRUCE,I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
46346,L285461,u1380,m91,DAWN,"You do, you do. You're just not saying."
46347,L285460,u1378,m91,BRUCE,I don't know?
46348,L285459,u1380,m91,DAWN,Where?
46349,L285458,u1378,m91,BRUCE,"We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow."
46350,L285457,u1380,m91,DAWN,What is it?
46351,L285433,u1378,m91,BRUCE,Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
46352,L285432,u1380,m91,DAWN,Air-raid?
46353,L285431,u1378,m91,BRUCE,"Boy, that was some air-raid."
46354,L285332,u1380,m91,DAWN,"Don't be so cheeky, Bruce."
46355,L285331,u1378,m91,BRUCE,"Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but...."
46356,L285210,u1378,m91,BRUCE,"I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass."
46357,L285209,u1380,m91,DAWN,They might be.
46358,L285208,u1378,m91,BRUCE,Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
46359,L285207,u1380,m91,DAWN,A bit too quick.
46360,L285206,u1378,m91,BRUCE,"It was great for me, how was it for you."
46361,L285611,u1379,m91,CLIVE,And the bride.
46362,L285610,u1384,m91,MAC,And absent bridegrooms!
46363,L285609,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Here's to music. And absent friends.
46364,L285606,u1384,m91,MAC,Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
46365,L285605,u1379,m91,CLIVE,And I'm still just a lad myself.
46366,L285604,u1384,m91,MAC,So you're going to be a grandfather.
46367,L285410,u1384,m91,MAC,I will if you will!
46368,L285409,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Don't panic!  Keep your head!
46369,L285405,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Bugger the Buffs.
46370,L285404,u1384,m91,MAC,"You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs."
46371,L285402,u1384,m91,MAC,There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
46372,L285401,u1379,m91,CLIVE,I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
46373,L285400,u1384,m91,MAC,Naturally.
46374,L285399,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Except the servicemen.
46375,L285398,u1384,m91,MAC,Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
46376,L285397,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"How's your war, Mac?"
46377,L285396,u1384,m91,MAC,Propaganda. We've been had.
46378,L285395,u1379,m91,CLIVE,There was talk of planting some when we first came.
46379,L285394,u1384,m91,MAC,You need trees for an avenue.
46380,L285393,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Why not?
46381,L285392,u1384,m91,MAC,Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
46382,L285391,u1379,m91,CLIVE,What about it?
46383,L285390,u1384,m91,MAC,"Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street."
46384,L285389,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about."
46385,L285084,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years."
46386,L285083,u1384,m91,MAC,What did we know? We were seventeen.
46387,L285082,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will."
46388,L285081,u1384,m91,MAC,"You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot."
46389,L285078,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Kiss me Hardy.
46390,L285077,u1384,m91,MAC,"Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you."
46391,L285076,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"Weeds will grow, Mac."
46392,L285075,u1384,m91,MAC,"Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold."
46393,L285044,u1384,m91,MAC,What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
46394,L285043,u1379,m91,CLIVE,And Jim.
46395,L285040,u1384,m91,MAC,"....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs."
46396,L285039,u1379,m91,CLIVE,...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
46397,L285038,u1384,m91,MAC,"...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin."
46398,L285014,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
46399,L285013,u1384,m91,MAC,"Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship."
46400,L285615,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Fair enough.  The river.
46401,L285614,u1381,m91,GRACE,"I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer."
46402,L285383,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Where to?
46403,L285382,u1381,m91,GRACE,I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
46404,L285381,u1379,m91,CLIVE,I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
46405,L285380,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"Not till Christmas, I don't suppose."
46406,L285379,u1381,m91,GRACE,When do you think you'll get leave again?
46407,L285370,u1379,m91,CLIVE,A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
46408,L285369,u1381,m91,GRACE,What are you going to be then?
46409,L285368,u1379,m91,CLIVE,I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
46410,L285367,u1381,m91,GRACE,Why didn't they say that before you started?
46411,L285366,u1379,m91,CLIVE,That's it.
46412,L285365,u1381,m91,GRACE,You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
46413,L285363,u1381,m91,GRACE,You taste it.
46414,L285362,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
46415,L285358,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Jam is jam! It's just jam!
46416,L285357,u1381,m91,GRACE,It looks....foreign.
46417,L285356,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Well?
46418,L285354,u1381,m91,GRACE,How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
46419,L285353,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"Well, it's off ration. We know that."
46420,L285352,u1381,m91,GRACE,We don't know anything about it
46421,L285347,u1379,m91,CLIVE,Jam.
46422,L285346,u1381,m91,GRACE,And what's that?
46423,L285107,u1381,m91,GRACE,"I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas."
46424,L285106,u1379,m91,CLIVE,"Oh, that."
46425,L285105,u1381,m91,GRACE,You joined up.
46426,L285104,u1379,m91,CLIVE,What's that?
46427,L285103,u1381,m91,GRACE,Has Sue got it right?
46428,L285054,u1381,m91,GRACE,And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
46429,L285053,u1379,m91,CLIVE,We all had to write a last letter home.
46430,L285051,u1381,m91,GRACE,They'd gone.
46431,L285050,u1379,m91,CLIVE,We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
46432,L285049,u1381,m91,GRACE,No Turks.
46433,L285641,u1380,m91,DAWN,Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
46434,L285640,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Now take deep breaths, and push."
46435,L285588,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?"
46436,L285587,u1380,m91,DAWN,It looks a bit fishy to me.
46437,L285525,u1380,m91,DAWN,It's not. It's happening to me.
46438,L285524,u1381,m91,GRACE,I don't believe this is happening to me.
46439,L285478,u1380,m91,DAWN,"Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that."
46440,L285477,u1381,m91,GRACE,I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
46441,L285476,u1380,m91,DAWN,He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
46442,L285475,u1381,m91,GRACE,What did he say?
46443,L285467,u1381,m91,GRACE,Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
46444,L285466,u1380,m91,DAWN,He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
46445,L285465,u1381,m91,GRACE,"What is it, pet?"
46446,L285312,u1380,m91,DAWN,Who said anything about love?
46447,L285311,u1381,m91,GRACE,"You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life."
46448,L285308,u1381,m91,GRACE,"There, there, my baby."
46449,L285307,u1380,m91,DAWN,I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
46450,L285304,u1380,m91,DAWN,"No, I won't."
46451,L285303,u1381,m91,GRACE,You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
46452,L285302,u1380,m91,DAWN,Out.
46453,L285301,u1381,m91,GRACE,And where do you think you're going?
46454,L285257,u1380,m91,DAWN,"It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up."
46455,L285256,u1381,m91,GRACE,I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
46456,L285223,u1380,m91,DAWN,"That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there."
46457,L285222,u1381,m91,GRACE,The ideas you get in your head.
46458,L285221,u1380,m91,DAWN,"Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me."
46459,L285151,u1380,m91,DAWN,"Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?"
46460,L285150,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Don't be silly, Dawn."
46461,L285149,u1380,m91,DAWN,What would we do if a German came into the house?
46462,L285145,u1381,m91,GRACE,Half the time he's bluffing.
46463,L285144,u1380,m91,DAWN,He always knows.
46464,L285137,u1380,m91,DAWN,After this dance.
46465,L285136,u1381,m91,GRACE,Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
46466,L285135,u1380,m91,DAWN,You know it? It must be an old one.
46467,L285033,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Just ignore her, Mac."
46468,L285032,u1380,m91,DAWN,"This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started."
46469,L285031,u1381,m91,GRACE,I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
46470,L285558,u1381,m91,GRACE,Wasn't it lovely?
46471,L285557,u1383,m91,GRANDMA,"...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls."
46472,L285545,u1383,m91,GRANDMA,How are we going to cope?
46473,L285544,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Up to six weeks, I think."
46474,L285543,u1383,m91,GRANDMA,"Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?"
46475,L285003,u1383,m91,GRANDMA,Or what?
46476,L285002,u1381,m91,GRACE,"No, Mother! It's War! War!"
46477,L285001,u1383,m91,GRANDMA,Is it peace in out time?
46478,L285535,u1384,m91,MAC,"Look after yourself, Grace."
46479,L285534,u1381,m91,GRACE,I wish it could all have been different.
46480,L285533,u1384,m91,MAC,You might still have a house.
46481,L285532,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?"
46482,L285503,u1381,m91,GRACE,"We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac."
46483,L285502,u1384,m91,MAC,We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
46484,L285501,u1381,m91,GRACE,"This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back."
46485,L285500,u1384,m91,MAC,We did the decent thing.
46486,L285499,u1381,m91,GRACE,He could always make me laugh.
46487,L285498,u1384,m91,MAC,Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
46488,L285497,u1381,m91,GRACE,"You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did."
46489,L285496,u1384,m91,MAC,"It's all better left unsaid, Grace."
46490,L285495,u1381,m91,GRACE,Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
46491,L285494,u1384,m91,MAC,"She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'"
46492,L285492,u1384,m91,MAC,A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
46493,L285491,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?"
46494,L285486,u1384,m91,MAC,"Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly."

46496,L285438,u1381,m91,GRACE,That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
46497,L285437,u1384,m91,MAC,...since I used to take you to the Proms?
46498,L285436,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since..."
46499,L285250,u1384,m91,MAC,"Play something, Grace."
46500,L285249,u1381,m91,GRACE,It seems to have survived.
46501,L285130,u1384,m91,MAC,Grace!
46502,L285129,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want."
46503,L285122,u1384,m91,MAC,"It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake."
46504,L285121,u1381,m91,GRACE,I can't do it. What's the point?
46505,L285042,u1384,m91,MAC,How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
46506,L285041,u1381,m91,GRACE,It was the best time of his life.
46507,L285608,u1381,m91,GRACE,And now we're glad you did.
46508,L285607,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn."
46509,L285529,u1381,m91,GRACE,How long?
46510,L285528,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us."
46511,L285527,u1381,m91,GRACE,What did I do to deserve this?
46512,L285448,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness."
46513,L285447,u1381,m91,GRACE,"Father, that's enough now"
46514,L285446,u1382,m91,GRANDFATHER GEORGE,"To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson."

46519,L285423,u1385,m91,MOLLY,Am I? Maybe I am.
46520,L285422,u1381,m91,GRACE,"You're having me on, Molly."
46521,L285421,u1385,m91,MOLLY,Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
46522,L285420,u1381,m91,GRACE,Molly!
46523,L285418,u1381,m91,GRACE,"You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really."
46524,L285417,u1385,m91,MOLLY,"I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own."
46525,L285416,u1381,m91,GRACE,I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
46526,L285415,u1385,m91,MOLLY,"God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor."
46527,L285021,u1381,m91,GRACE,I know you mean well.
46528,L285020,u1385,m91,MOLLY,"I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?"
46529,L285019,u1385,m91,MOLLY,Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
46530,L285018,u1381,m91,GRACE,It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.

46675,L290527,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken."
46676,L290526,u1389,m92,BILL,"Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache."
46677,L290525,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?"
46678,L290357,u1394,m92,JERRY,No problem.
46679,L290356,u1389,m92,BILL,Thanks.
46680,L290355,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there."
46681,L290325,u1389,m92,BILL,And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
46682,L290324,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now."
46683,L290312,u1389,m92,BILL,You're a real fucking piece of work.
46684,L290311,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Well, technically I did what ya said."

46686,L290309,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back."

46688,L290307,u1389,m92,BILL,"Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble."

46690,L290305,u1389,m92,BILL,"OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet."
46691,L290301,u1389,m92,BILL,Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
46692,L290300,u1394,m92,JERRY,What was that?
46693,L290295,u1394,m92,JERRY,"No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing."
46694,L290294,u1389,m92,BILL,"Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit."
46695,L290293,u1394,m92,JERRY,That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
46696,L290244,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Cat fight, cat fight."

46700,L290231,u1389,m92,BILL,What's that?
46701,L290230,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to."
46702,L290227,u1389,m92,BILL,I don't know.
46703,L290226,u1394,m92,JERRY,I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
46704,L290225,u1389,m92,BILL,How much further?
46705,L290224,u1394,m92,JERRY,Keep straight on this road here.
46706,L290127,u1394,m92,JERRY,Hell yeah.

46710,L290123,u1394,m92,JERRY,Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
46711,L290122,u1394,m92,JERRY,"OK, Boss."
46712,L290121,u1389,m92,BILL,I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
46713,L290120,u1394,m92,JERRY,I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
46714,L290119,u1389,m92,BILL,Perfect.
46715,L290118,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit."
46716,L290117,u1389,m92,BILL,"I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man."
46717,L290116,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, ""Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."""
46718,L290115,u1389,m92,BILL,"Oh yeah, I remember now."
46719,L290114,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Then the devil says, ""are you gay?"" Guy says, ""fuck no""... Devil says, ""Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."""
46720,L290113,u1389,m92,BILL,Yeah.
46721,L290112,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Then the devil asks, ""do you drink?"" Guy says, ""yeah""... devil say, ""wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."""
46722,L290111,u1389,m92,BILL,"Shit, we really need to find some gas."
46723,L290110,u1394,m92,JERRY,"So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, ""do you smoke?"" The guy say, ""yeah""... the devil say, ""great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."""
46724,L290109,u1389,m92,BILL,"Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end."
46725,L290108,u1389,m92,BILL,Hot has got nothing to do with it.
46726,L290107,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts."
46727,L290106,u1389,m92,BILL,"Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit."
46728,L290105,u1394,m92,JERRY,"I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen."
46729,L290104,u1389,m92,BILL,I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
46730,L290103,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around."
46731,L290102,u1389,m92,BILL,"Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot."
46732,L290101,u1394,m92,JERRY,As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
46733,L290100,u1389,m92,BILL,"Yeah, no shit."
46734,L290099,u1394,m92,JERRY,"If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot."
46735,L290098,u1389,m92,BILL,"Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?"
46736,L290097,u1394,m92,JERRY,"There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself."
46737,L290096,u1389,m92,BILL,"Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling."
46738,L290095,u1394,m92,JERRY,She's pretty cute.
46739,L290094,u1389,m92,BILL,"Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot."
46740,L290093,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig."
46741,L290612,u1392,m92,DENISE,Lock the fucking doors.
46742,L290611,u1389,m92,BILL,"Don't look back, just get in the car."
46743,L290592,u1392,m92,DENISE,"I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless."
46744,L290591,u1389,m92,BILL,"Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else."
46745,L290588,u1389,m92,BILL,"Man, it's already ten thirty."
46746,L290587,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous."
46747,L290569,u1392,m92,DENISE,"That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke."
46748,L290568,u1389,m92,BILL,Just grin and bear it.
46749,L290559,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Yeah, showtime for what?"
46750,L290558,u1389,m92,BILL,What's he so excited about?
46751,L290465,u1392,m92,DENISE,I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
46752,L290464,u1389,m92,BILL,"Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage."
46753,L290339,u1392,m92,DENISE,Turn that fucking radio off!
46754,L290338,u1389,m92,BILL,Fuck! We are fucked!
46755,L290285,u1389,m92,BILL,He won't move.
46756,L290284,u1392,m92,DENISE,Honk at him. Scare him.
46757,L290213,u1392,m92,DENISE,Here he comes.
46758,L290212,u1389,m92,BILL,I like sleep.
46759,L290621,u1389,m92,BILL,It won't work.
46760,L290620,u1395,m92,MARY,Drive through it!
46761,L290619,u1389,m92,BILL,I gotta open the gate.
46762,L290618,u1395,m92,MARY,What are you doing!
46763,L290598,u1395,m92,MARY,"Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?"
46764,L290597,u1389,m92,BILL,Quiet.
46765,L290596,u1395,m92,MARY,How much is a person supposed to stand?
46766,L290575,u1389,m92,BILL,Just sit back and enjoy the show.
46767,L290574,u1395,m92,MARY,This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
46768,L290571,u1389,m92,BILL,"Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace."
46769,L290570,u1395,m92,MARY,Check this out.
46770,L290503,u1389,m92,BILL,Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
46771,L290502,u1395,m92,MARY,I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
46772,L290350,u1389,m92,BILL,"Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched."
46773,L290349,u1395,m92,MARY,"Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself."
46774,L290348,u1389,m92,BILL,Forget it. I'll just go.
46775,L290337,u1389,m92,BILL,Fine! I'll go straight!
46776,L290336,u1395,m92,MARY,What!
46777,L290335,u1389,m92,BILL,Fine. I'll go straight.

46779,L290322,u1389,m92,BILL,"Well, I got some bad news and some bad news."
46780,L290292,u1395,m92,MARY,Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
46781,L290291,u1389,m92,BILL,"Hey, he moved."
46782,L290288,u1395,m92,MARY,"Then run him over, he'll move."
46783,L290287,u1389,m92,BILL,There's not enough room.
46784,L290286,u1395,m92,MARY,Go around him.
46785,L290283,u1389,m92,BILL,There's a dog in the road.
46786,L290282,u1395,m92,MARY,Why are we stopping?
46787,L290254,u1389,m92,BILL,Where ya headed?
46788,L290253,u1395,m92,MARY,Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
46789,L290240,u1395,m92,MARY,She looks like a freak.
46790,L290239,u1389,m92,BILL,We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
46791,L290238,u1395,m92,MARY,Should we stop?
46792,L290235,u1389,m92,BILL,It's a girl.
46793,L290234,u1395,m92,MARY,"Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days."
46794,L290184,u1395,m92,MARY,"Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer."
46795,L290183,u1389,m92,BILL,We'll need pictures of the inside too.
46796,L290672,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Enough talk, write."
46797,L290671,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care."
46798,L290670,u1401,m92,WYDELL,How's about you give me those same directions.
46799,L290669,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here."
46800,L290668,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Is that all... think real hard.
46801,L290667,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit."
46802,L290666,u1401,m92,WYDELL,And...
46803,L290663,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions."
46804,L290662,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?"
46805,L290661,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,Hmmmmmmmmm?
46806,L290660,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Come on, get with the facts."
46807,L290657,u1401,m92,WYDELL,You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
46808,L290656,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying."
46809,L290655,u1401,m92,WYDELL,What I need are some answers.
46810,L290654,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about."
46811,L290086,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?"
46812,L290085,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,Fuck your grandmother.
46813,L290065,u1400,m92,STUCKY,I hear ya.

46815,L290062,u1400,m92,STUCKY,Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
46816,L290061,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"Yeah, now there's the perfect woman."
46817,L290060,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet."
46818,L290059,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
46819,L290058,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out."
46820,L290057,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,Goddamn.
46821,L290056,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole."
46822,L290055,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
46823,L290054,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball."
46824,L290053,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,What?
46825,L290052,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes."
46826,L290051,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
46827,L290050,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something."
46828,L290049,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,"Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat."
46829,L290048,u1400,m92,STUCKY,That kid is one horny retard.
46830,L290047,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,Fascinating.
46831,L290046,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook."
46832,L290045,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
46833,L290044,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb."
46834,L290043,u1390,m92,CAPT. SPAULDING,Hmmmmm.
46835,L290042,u1400,m92,STUCKY,"I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June."
46836,L290516,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin."
46837,L290515,u1392,m92,DENISE,"What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business."
46838,L290514,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all."
46839,L290513,u1392,m92,DENISE,Oh.
46840,L290512,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much."
46841,L290508,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work."
46842,L290507,u1392,m92,DENISE,You sure you don't need any help in there?
46843,L290492,u1392,m92,DENISE,How's he get around out here?
46844,L290491,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle."
46845,L290488,u1396,m92,MOTHER,He should be back in a couple hours.
46846,L290487,u1392,m92,DENISE,How long is that gonna take?
46847,L290475,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters."
46848,L290474,u1396,m92,MOTHER,That's nice.
46849,L290473,u1392,m92,DENISE,"No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down."
46850,L290458,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more."
46851,L290457,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?"
46852,L290882,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Help, help us."
46853,L290881,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!"
46854,L290880,u1392,m92,DENISE,That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
46855,L290879,u1394,m92,JERRY,"That was good babe, just keep doing that."
46856,L290878,u1394,m92,JERRY,"I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it."
46857,L290877,u1392,m92,DENISE,I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
46858,L290876,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood."
46859,L290875,u1392,m92,DENISE,"We've got get out of here, we got get out of here."
46860,L290595,u1394,m92,JERRY,Shhhhhh.
46861,L290594,u1392,m92,DENISE,You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
46862,L290581,u1392,m92,DENISE,"This isn't funny, it's twisted."
46863,L290580,u1394,m92,JERRY,"I don't know, I think he's funny."
46864,L290579,u1392,m92,DENISE,What are you laughing at?
46865,L290506,u1392,m92,DENISE,Shhhhhh.
46866,L290505,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up."
46867,L290504,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Really, now is not the time to make waves."
46868,L290499,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Yes, thank you. Thank you very much."
46869,L290498,u1392,m92,DENISE,Thank you.
46870,L290451,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Dude, your chick's a little high strung."
46871,L290450,u1392,m92,DENISE,Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
46872,L290449,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob."
46873,L290393,u1392,m92,DENISE,When you were outside with Bill.
46874,L290392,u1394,m92,JERRY,When?
46875,L290391,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us."
46876,L290385,u1394,m92,JERRY,I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
46877,L290384,u1392,m92,DENISE,"You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?"
46878,L290383,u1394,m92,JERRY,"I don't know, I just thought it was interesting."
46879,L290382,u1392,m92,DENISE,So what?
46880,L290381,u1394,m92,JERRY,These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
46881,L290380,u1392,m92,DENISE,Yeah?
46882,L290379,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, ""criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."""
46883,L290378,u1392,m92,DENISE,Why?
46884,L290377,u1394,m92,JERRY,Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
46885,L290376,u1392,m92,DENISE,So.
46886,L290375,u1394,m92,JERRY,"It says, ""records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."""
46887,L290374,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?"
46888,L290373,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder."
46889,L290372,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Oh, yeah."
46890,L290371,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan."
46891,L290370,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Fuck, it's freezing."
46892,L290237,u1392,m92,DENISE,That seems likely.
46893,L290236,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Hey, maybe she knows where this is?"
46894,L290217,u1394,m92,JERRY,Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
46895,L290216,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Ugh, what's that smell?"
46896,L290182,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun."
46897,L290181,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Aw, come on. It will be fun."
46898,L290179,u1392,m92,DENISE,I don't want to see that.
46899,L290178,u1394,m92,JERRY,This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
46900,L290177,u1392,m92,DENISE,Tickets for what?
46901,L290176,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets."
46902,L290131,u1394,m92,JERRY,Grab Mary and come inside.
46903,L290130,u1392,m92,DENISE,Huh?
46904,L290201,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye."
46905,L290200,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding."
46906,L290199,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid."
46907,L290198,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner."
46908,L290197,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place."
46909,L290196,u1392,m92,DENISE,"No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule."
46910,L290195,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?"
46911,L290524,u1395,m92,MARY,"Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place."
46912,L290523,u1392,m92,DENISE,Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
46913,L290490,u1392,m92,DENISE,Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
46914,L290489,u1395,m92,MARY,A couple hours!
46915,L290455,u1395,m92,MARY,"Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend."
46916,L290454,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Excuse me, may I please use your phone?"
46917,L290422,u1395,m92,MARY,I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
46918,L290421,u1392,m92,DENISE,Jesus Christ.
46919,L290415,u1392,m92,DENISE,Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
46920,L290414,u1395,m92,MARY,I still don't.
46921,L290413,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Shhhhhh, quiet."
46922,L290412,u1395,m92,MARY,I don't hear anything.
46923,L290410,u1395,m92,MARY,Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
46924,L290409,u1392,m92,DENISE,What? I didn't hear anything.
46925,L290408,u1395,m92,MARY,What was that?
46926,L290407,u1392,m92,DENISE,I don't know... about half an hour.
46927,L290406,u1395,m92,MARY,How long has it been?
46928,L290395,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Yeah, she said we looked queer."
46929,L290394,u1395,m92,MARY,She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
46930,L290343,u1392,m92,DENISE,I can't believe...
46931,L290342,u1395,m92,MARY,I think I'm going fucking crazy.
46932,L290304,u1395,m92,MARY,"God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit."
46933,L290303,u1392,m92,DENISE,You got to be fucking joking.
46934,L290302,u1395,m92,MARY,Don't even say it.
46935,L290242,u1395,m92,MARY,She looks like she stinks.
46936,L290241,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked."
46937,L290229,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it."
46938,L290228,u1395,m92,MARY,Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
46939,L290211,u1395,m92,MARY,Maybe he's a cyborg.
46940,L290210,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10."
46941,L290209,u1395,m92,MARY,"Geez, he never gets tired does he."
46942,L290175,u1395,m92,MARY,"Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me."
46943,L290174,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Scattered, smothered and covered."
46944,L290173,u1395,m92,MARY,"If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl."
46945,L290172,u1392,m92,DENISE,"A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap."
46946,L290171,u1395,m92,MARY,"I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it."
46947,L290170,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous."
46948,L290169,u1395,m92,MARY,"It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal."
46949,L290167,u1395,m92,MARY,"Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?"
46950,L290166,u1392,m92,DENISE,"God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me."
46951,L290165,u1395,m92,MARY,Tell me about it.
46952,L290164,u1392,m92,DENISE,I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
46953,L290141,u1395,m92,MARY,"Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway."
46954,L290140,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?"
46955,L290139,u1395,m92,MARY,"Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap."
46956,L290138,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug."
46957,L290137,u1395,m92,MARY,I resign.
46958,L290136,u1392,m92,DENISE,Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
46959,L290135,u1395,m92,MARY,"No please, let me sit this one out."
46960,L290134,u1392,m92,DENISE,Rise and shine.
46961,L290133,u1395,m92,MARY,Sleeping.
46962,L290132,u1392,m92,DENISE,"Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work."
46963,L290726,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Yep, I found something."
46964,L290725,u1393,m92,HUSTON,"You find something, Georgie?"
46965,L290724,u1401,m92,WYDELL,God damn.
46966,L290715,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Yep, I suppose it is."
46967,L290714,u1393,m92,HUSTON,That's the understatement of the year.
46968,L290713,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
46969,L290712,u1393,m92,HUSTON,"Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em."
46970,L290711,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Not yet.
46971,L290710,u1393,m92,HUSTON,Recover any bodies?
46972,L290709,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Yeah, no mercy here."
46973,L290708,u1393,m92,HUSTON,"Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing."
46974,L290707,u1401,m92,WYDELL,A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
46975,L290706,u1393,m92,HUSTON,"What'd we here, Georgie?"
46976,L290722,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Yes, sir."
46977,L290721,u1393,m92,HUSTON,Open up the trunk.
46978,L290720,u1398,m92,NAISH,Huh?
46979,L290719,u1393,m92,HUSTON,"Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree."
46980,L290718,u1398,m92,NAISH,Keys.
46981,L290717,u1393,m92,HUSTON,What'd ya got there?
46982,L290861,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Aw, honey you know I can't do that."
46983,L290860,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody."
46984,L290859,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Bye sweety, we could of been great together."
46985,L290563,u1394,m92,JERRY,Great.
46986,L290562,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love."
46987,L290561,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Oh, you mean on TV."
46988,L290560,u1396,m92,MOTHER,For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
46989,L290540,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?"
46990,L290539,u1396,m92,MOTHER,Firefly.
46991,L290538,u1394,m92,JERRY,"I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm."
46992,L290521,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Didn't ya think, Mary?"
46993,L290520,u1396,m92,MOTHER,Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
46994,L290519,u1394,m92,JERRY,Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
46995,L290478,u1394,m92,JERRY,I was just kidding.
46996,L290477,u1396,m92,MOTHER,I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
46997,L290476,u1394,m92,JERRY,And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
46998,L290472,u1394,m92,JERRY,I don't doubt that.
46999,L290471,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen."
47000,L290470,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown."
47001,L290469,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?"
47002,L290463,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary."
47003,L290462,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"What do they call you, sweety?"
47004,L290461,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Oh, right."
47005,L290460,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J."
47006,L290459,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone."
47007,L290590,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero."
47008,L290589,u1395,m92,MARY,"I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid."
47009,L290567,u1395,m92,MARY,"I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words."
47010,L290566,u1394,m92,JERRY,This is way too fucked up for words.
47011,L290424,u1395,m92,MARY,Enough with the stupid voices.
47012,L290423,u1394,m92,JERRY,"OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality."
47013,L290420,u1395,m92,MARY,What!
47014,L290419,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy."
47015,L290390,u1395,m92,MARY,You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
47016,L290389,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion."
47017,L290388,u1395,m92,MARY,That stupid hillbilly slut.
47018,L290387,u1394,m92,JERRY,Huh?
47019,L290386,u1395,m92,MARY,"God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch."
47020,L290347,u1395,m92,MARY,"You said it, not me."
47021,L290346,u1394,m92,JERRY,I'll go. It's my fault.
47022,L290333,u1394,m92,JERRY,"I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?"
47023,L290332,u1395,m92,MARY,Just back up.
47024,L290215,u1395,m92,MARY,Huh?
47025,L290214,u1394,m92,JERRY,"We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy."
47026,L290204,u1394,m92,JERRY,"Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds."
47027,L290203,u1395,m92,MARY,"Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain."
47028,L290202,u1394,m92,JERRY,I'm gonna go ask him.
47029,L290610,u1395,m92,MARY,"Don't worry, I'm gone."
47030,L290609,u1396,m92,MOTHER,I suggest you kids leave now.
47031,L290497,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner."
47032,L290496,u1395,m92,MARY,Sorry.
47033,L290495,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you."
47034,L290481,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day."
47035,L290480,u1395,m92,MARY,"No, just a little too old."
47036,L290479,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween."
47037,L290648,u1399,m92,OTIS,"You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized."
47038,L290647,u1395,m92,MARY,"What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please."
47039,L290646,u1399,m92,OTIS,"Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?"
47040,L290645,u1395,m92,MARY,"Fuck you, you fucking freak!"
47041,L290644,u1399,m92,OTIS,"Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes."
47042,L290643,u1395,m92,MARY,"This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real."
47043,L290642,u1399,m92,OTIS,Behold... The Fish-Boy!
47044,L290640,u1399,m92,OTIS,Let's go see.
47045,L290639,u1395,m92,MARY,Where is he?
47046,L290638,u1399,m92,OTIS,"Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK."
47047,L290637,u1395,m92,MARY,Where's Bill?
47048,L290636,u1399,m92,OTIS,"Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!"
47049,L290635,u1395,m92,MARY,Why? Why are you doing this?
47050,L290802,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?"
47051,L290801,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
47052,L290798,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform."
47053,L290797,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Thank you.
47054,L290796,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all."
47055,L290795,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Please, just a minute."
47056,L290794,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"I um... no, I don't think so..."
47057,L290793,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something."
47058,L290792,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry."
47059,L290791,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?"
47060,L290790,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know."
47061,L290789,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions."
47062,L290788,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?"
47063,L290787,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon."
47064,L290786,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Well hello, officer."
47065,L290869,u1399,m92,OTIS,"Well, go get her."
47066,L290868,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but..."
47067,L290858,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Wait, I want to say good-bye."
47068,L290857,u1399,m92,OTIS,Get in... now!
47069,L290830,u1399,m92,OTIS,Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
47070,L290829,u1396,m92,MOTHER,Who's your Daddy!
47071,L290828,u1399,m92,OTIS,I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...
47072,L290776,u1399,m92,OTIS,Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
47073,L290775,u1396,m92,MOTHER,What should I do?
47074,L290774,u1399,m92,OTIS,"I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this."
47075,L290773,u1396,m92,MOTHER,I don't know. I only saw one.
47076,L290770,u1399,m92,OTIS,"What! God damn, how many?"
47077,L290769,u1396,m92,MOTHER,"Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside."
47078,L290552,u1399,m92,OTIS,I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
47079,L290551,u1396,m92,MOTHER,Grampa... watch the language.
47080,L290809,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,Right.
47081,L290808,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down."
47082,L290800,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,Call Wydell.
47083,L290799,u1398,m92,NAISH,Jesus Christ.
47084,L290785,u1398,m92,NAISH,Shit... fuck procedure.
47085,L290784,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,Tell it to my daughter.
47086,L290783,u1398,m92,NAISH,I ain't got a warrant.
47087,L290782,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,We gotta break it open.
47088,L290780,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Over here, inside the smokehouse."
47089,L290779,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?"
47090,L290778,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,Shhhh... you hear that?
47091,L290777,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?"
47092,L290765,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,Where we headed?
47093,L290764,u1398,m92,NAISH,Turn up this road.
47094,L290761,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid."
47095,L290760,u1398,m92,NAISH,"No they couldn't, somebody had to see something."
47096,L290759,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear."
47097,L290750,u1398,m92,NAISH,"No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble."
47098,L290749,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,Fit the profile?
47099,L290748,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway."
47100,L290739,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,George Willis...  ...any leads?
47101,L290738,u1398,m92,NAISH,Hey.
47102,L290763,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,I pray to God there is.
47103,L290762,u1401,m92,WYDELL,I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
47104,L290752,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?"
47105,L290751,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
47106,L290747,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one."
47107,L290746,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,What about the body you found?
47108,L290743,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,Dr. Satan?
47109,L290742,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan."
47110,L290741,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,That's it?
47111,L290740,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point."
47112,L290737,u1401,m92,WYDELL,I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
47113,L290736,u1397,m92,MR. WILLIS,"Yes, sir."
47114,L290735,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Mr. Willis?
47115,L290806,u1398,m92,NAISH,We found one.
47116,L290805,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Over.
47117,L290804,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Excuse me for a second.
47118,L290803,u1398,m92,NAISH,Wydell.
47119,L290768,u1398,m92,NAISH,Right...  ...come on.
47120,L290767,u1401,m92,WYDELL,I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
47121,L290754,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her."
47122,L290753,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Don't worry, we'll find her."
47123,L290745,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms."
47124,L290744,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with."
47125,L290734,u1401,m92,WYDELL,That must be him.
47126,L290733,u1398,m92,NAISH,I guess not.
47127,L290732,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop."
47128,L290731,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way."
47129,L290730,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help."
47130,L290729,u1398,m92,NAISH,You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
47131,L290687,u1401,m92,WYDELL,Call the chief... We found 'em.
47132,L290686,u1398,m92,NAISH,Plates match.
47133,L290685,u1398,m92,NAISH,What.
47134,L290684,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Aw, fuck."
47135,L290683,u1398,m92,NAISH,Hulk was dumb as shit.
47136,L290682,u1401,m92,WYDELL,I always favored the Hulk.
47137,L290681,u1398,m92,NAISH,"You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit."
47138,L290680,u1401,m92,WYDELL,How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
47139,L290679,u1398,m92,NAISH,"You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics."
47140,L290678,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?"
47141,L290677,u1398,m92,NAISH,Your Spidey senses tingling.
47142,L290676,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different."
47143,L290675,u1398,m92,NAISH,"Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced."
47144,L290651,u1398,m92,NAISH,Right.
47145,L290650,u1401,m92,WYDELL,"Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us."
47146,L294971,u1402,m93,FATHER,"It's going famously, son, famously!"
47147,L294970,u1406,m93,MOTHER,"Tell him, Harold."
47148,L294497,u1402,m93,FATHER,"Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up."
47149,L294496,u1406,m93,MOTHER,"Tell him, Harold."
47150,L294445,u1402,m93,FATHER,And think about what you've done.
47151,L294444,u1406,m93,MOTHER,And?
47152,L294443,u1402,m93,FATHER,"No ""buts."" Go to your room now."
47153,L294442,u1406,m93,MOTHER,Harold! Tell the boy again.
47154,L294437,u1402,m93,FATHER,"That is the wrong fork, young man."
47155,L294436,u1406,m93,MOTHER,"That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy."
47156,L294331,u1402,m93,FATHER,"Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?"
47157,L294330,u1406,m93,MOTHER,"And furthermore... Tell him, Harold."
47158,L294347,u1403,m93,FEMALE ROOMMATE,"You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake."
47159,L294346,u1405,m93,LILA,"Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?"
47160,L294345,u1403,m93,FEMALE ROOMMATE,"Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested."
47161,L294344,u1405,m93,LILA,"How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?"
47162,L294343,u1403,m93,FEMALE ROOMMATE,"Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help."
47163,L294342,u1405,m93,LILA,"Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows."
47164,L294341,u1403,m93,FEMALE ROOMMATE,"It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?"
47165,L294340,u1405,m93,LILA,"It's embarrassing, okay?"
47166,L294339,u1403,m93,FEMALE ROOMMATE,I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
47167,L294337,u1405,m93,LILA,Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
47168,L294336,u1403,m93,FEMALE ROOMMATE,"Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date."
47169,L295058,u1409,m93,PUFF,Oui.
47170,L295057,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,French?
47171,L295056,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Let's go eat, I'm starved."
47172,L295055,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you."
47173,L295054,u1409,m93,PUFF,"As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?"
47174,L295052,u1409,m93,PUFF,Woof.
47175,L295051,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
47176,L295050,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Like father, like son."
47177,L295049,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,You remind me so much of Nathan.
47178,L295048,u1409,m93,PUFF,Gabrielle.
47179,L295047,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Say my name.
47180,L295046,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Great.  God, I've wanted you forever."
47181,L295045,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked."
47182,L295044,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off."
47183,L295043,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Hello, my little boy."
47184,L294990,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Okay.
47185,L294989,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No.
47186,L294988,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Please let me go with you.
47187,L294987,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"A little resistance would be nice, damn it."
47188,L294986,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Okay, my sweet. Good night."
47189,L294985,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
47190,L294984,u1407,m93,NATHAN,You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
47191,L294983,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
47192,L294982,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
47193,L294981,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Where do we look for little lost Puff?
47194,L294980,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back."
47195,L294979,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,We still have you and I.
47196,L294978,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous."
47197,L294977,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Oui.
47198,L294976,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I want our boy back.
47199,L294975,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I don't know.
47200,L294974,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong."
47201,L294967,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I don't know. Something's missing.
47202,L294966,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri."
47203,L294927,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,That's Lila?
47204,L294926,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Lila?
47205,L294910,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
47206,L294909,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men."
47207,L294902,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said "" au revoir."""
47208,L294901,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
47209,L294900,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,You were wonderful!
47210,L294858,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?"
47211,L294857,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
47212,L294856,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Hunh.
47213,L294855,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle."
47214,L294854,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,That's not how he tells it.
47215,L294853,u1407,m93,NATHAN,That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
47216,L294852,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
47217,L294851,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No!
47218,L294850,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,I've moved on.
47219,L294849,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
47220,L294848,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Anyway. Come already to the point.
47221,L294847,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No. You look so beautiful.
47222,L294846,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Please. I look a mess.
47223,L294845,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"God, you're beautiful."
47224,L294844,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Well?
47225,L294841,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you."
47226,L294840,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
47227,L294839,u1407,m93,NATHAN,What?
47228,L294838,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
47229,L294837,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Well, I think..."
47230,L294836,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,What for?
47231,L294835,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person."
47232,L294834,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Like what?
47233,L294833,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I've got some things to tell you.
47234,L294832,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!"
47235,L294831,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Please. Just one minute of your time.
47236,L294830,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!"
47237,L294829,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I just want to talk.
47238,L294828,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
47239,L294827,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Hi. It's Nathan.
47240,L294826,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Yeah? What?
47241,L294762,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!"
47242,L294761,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Urgh.
47243,L294760,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too."
47244,L294759,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Unnhh.
47245,L294758,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you."
47246,L294730,u1407,m93,NATHAN,But I don't know how to leave Lila.
47247,L294729,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"But?... But? There is a ""but,"" Nathan."
47248,L294728,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I love you so much, Gabrielle."
47249,L294727,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you."
47250,L294726,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out."
47251,L294725,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this."
47252,L294724,u1407,m93,NATHAN,What is it?
47253,L294723,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Stop. Get away.
47254,L294722,u1407,m93,NATHAN,My little French.
47255,L294721,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Very well.
47256,L294720,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Not in front of the boy.
47257,L294719,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Fine.
47258,L294718,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I."
47259,L294717,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Gabby, what is it?"
47260,L294716,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Hmmmph.
47261,L294715,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?"
47262,L294686,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
47263,L294685,u1407,m93,NATHAN,You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
47264,L294684,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?"
47265,L294683,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
47266,L294676,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Shit.  Hi, honey."
47267,L294675,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
47268,L294670,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world."
47269,L294669,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"What is wrong, my darling?"
47270,L294662,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Shh.
47271,L294661,u1407,m93,NATHAN,So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
47272,L294659,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,You are sweet.
47273,L294658,u1407,m93,NATHAN,It's true. I wouldn't lie.
47274,L294657,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
47275,L294656,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
47276,L294655,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower."
47277,L294654,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know."
47278,L294653,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,I am sleepy.
47279,L294652,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all."
47280,L294651,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
47281,L294650,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Yes. Happy happy.
47282,L294649,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?"
47283,L294648,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
47284,L294647,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Shall we close up, then?"
47285,L294645,u1407,m93,NATHAN,That would be good.
47286,L294644,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Oui.
47287,L294643,u1407,m93,NATHAN,When you were a little French girl?
47288,L294642,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
47289,L294641,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
47290,L294640,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?"
47291,L294639,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?"
47292,L294638,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
47293,L294637,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
47294,L294636,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Is everything fine?
47295,L294635,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
47296,L294634,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
47297,L294633,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?"
47298,L294632,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left."
47299,L294607,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
47300,L294606,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle."
47301,L294603,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?"
47302,L294602,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Of course not.
47303,L294601,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?"
47304,L294600,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Not at all.
47305,L294599,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Thank you so much for accompanying me.
47306,L294598,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?"
47307,L294597,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No. Don't be silly. It's just...
47308,L294596,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
47309,L294595,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to..."
47310,L294594,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?"
47311,L294593,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
47312,L294592,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
47313,L294591,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Oh, Hi, Gabrielle."
47314,L294588,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here."
47315,L294587,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Oui. Perfect!
47316,L294586,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
47317,L294585,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur."
47318,L294584,u1407,m93,NATHAN,You decide. Today is your day.
47319,L294583,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,Oui.
47320,L294582,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?"
47321,L294581,u1404,m93,GABRIELLE,"Oui, doctor, oui."
47322,L294580,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?"
47323,L295029,u1405,m93,LILA,Okay. If you think it will help.
47324,L295028,u1409,m93,PUFF,"But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind."
47325,L295027,u1405,m93,LILA,That's what I'm counting on.
47326,L295026,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us."
47327,L295025,u1405,m93,LILA,"No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail."
47328,L295024,u1409,m93,PUFF,I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
47329,L295023,u1405,m93,LILA,"Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life."
47330,L295022,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you."
47331,L295021,u1405,m93,LILA,"No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody."
47332,L295020,u1409,m93,PUFF,We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
47333,L295019,u1405,m93,LILA,He's dead.
47334,L294963,u1409,m93,PUFF,What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
47335,L294962,u1405,m93,LILA,"You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you."
47336,L294959,u1405,m93,LILA,"Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason."
47337,L294958,u1409,m93,PUFF,Nice night.
47338,L294957,u1405,m93,LILA,"Good. I'll show you how, apey."
47339,L294956,u1409,m93,PUFF,I want to be the way I was before.
47340,L294955,u1405,m93,LILA,You what?
47341,L294954,u1409,m93,PUFF,But I like being human now.
47342,L294953,u1405,m93,LILA,"We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it."
47343,L294801,u1409,m93,PUFF,Very well.
47344,L294800,u1405,m93,LILA,Very well.
47345,L294782,u1405,m93,LILA,"It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of."
47346,L294781,u1409,m93,PUFF,"It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know."
47347,L294773,u1409,m93,PUFF,Shan't happen again.
47348,L294772,u1405,m93,LILA,"It's okay, Puff."
47349,L294771,u1409,m93,PUFF,"My apologies, madam."
47350,L294946,u1410,m93,ROSE,No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
47351,L294945,u1405,m93,LILA,I'll be in touch.
47352,L294942,u1405,m93,LILA,I'm really glad you two found each other.
47353,L294941,u1410,m93,ROSE,"I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business."
47354,L294940,u1405,m93,LILA,"Shut up, you."
47355,L294939,u1410,m93,ROSE,And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
47356,L294938,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh, Rosie."
47357,L294937,u1410,m93,ROSE,I'm going to miss you.
47358,L294936,u1410,m93,ROSE,With pleasure.
47359,L294935,u1405,m93,LILA,"Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will."
47360,L294908,u1405,m93,LILA,Ready!
47361,L294907,u1410,m93,ROSE,Done!
47362,L294892,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time."
47363,L294891,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh, Rosie."
47364,L294890,u1410,m93,ROSE,"I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved."
47365,L294889,u1405,m93,LILA,Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
47366,L294888,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt."
47367,L294887,u1405,m93,LILA,Your brother should have his license revoked.
47368,L294886,u1410,m93,ROSE,Nathan told my brother.
47369,L294885,u1405,m93,LILA,How'd you know where I was?
47370,L294884,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Lila, I want to help you."
47371,L294883,u1405,m93,LILA,"Rose, please go away."
47372,L294882,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Please, honey, let me in."
47373,L294881,u1405,m93,LILA,"Go the fuck away, Rosie."
47374,L294880,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Lila, it's Rosie."
47375,L294879,u1405,m93,LILA,"No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking ""do not disturb"" sign on the fucking doorknob?"
47376,L294489,u1410,m93,ROSE,Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
47377,L294488,u1405,m93,LILA,And I think I'm going to.
47378,L294487,u1410,m93,ROSE,Yeah. My brother told me.
47379,L294486,u1405,m93,LILA,"Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him."
47380,L294485,u1410,m93,ROSE,Be still my crotch.
47381,L294484,u1405,m93,LILA,Three foot one.
47382,L294483,u1410,m93,ROSE,Oh?
47383,L294482,u1405,m93,LILA,I have a friend you might like to meet.
47384,L294481,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor."
47385,L294480,u1405,m93,LILA,I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
47386,L294479,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear."
47387,L294478,u1405,m93,LILA,Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
47388,L294477,u1410,m93,ROSE,No. I married a midget.
47389,L294476,u1405,m93,LILA,One night stand?
47390,L294475,u1410,m93,ROSE,Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
47391,L294474,u1405,m93,LILA,"He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with."
47392,L294473,u1410,m93,ROSE,Yeah?
47393,L294472,u1405,m93,LILA,I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
47394,L294471,u1410,m93,ROSE,My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
47395,L294431,u1410,m93,ROSE,Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
47396,L294430,u1405,m93,LILA,Really?
47397,L294429,u1410,m93,ROSE,"My brother says he likes you, too."
47398,L294428,u1405,m93,LILA,"I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work."
47399,L294427,u1410,m93,ROSE,So?
47400,L294397,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Yeah, well my brother is his shrink."
47401,L294396,u1405,m93,LILA,"God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff."
47402,L294395,u1410,m93,ROSE,"My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is ""mortifyingly ashamed"", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever."
47403,L294394,u1405,m93,LILA,Won't he be able to tell?
47404,L294393,u1410,m93,ROSE,My brother is discreet.
47405,L294392,u1405,m93,LILA,"Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?"
47406,L294391,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you."
47407,L294390,u1405,m93,LILA,What do you mean?
47408,L294389,u1410,m93,ROSE,Loves animals. Loves you.
47409,L294388,u1405,m93,LILA,"Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose."
47410,L294387,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Handsome, thirties, psychologist..."
47411,L294386,u1405,m93,LILA,Shut up and tell me.
47412,L294385,u1410,m93,ROSE,I don't get that. Is that sexual?
47413,L294384,u1405,m93,LILA,Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
47414,L294383,u1410,m93,ROSE,Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
47415,L294382,u1405,m93,LILA,Always. Ow.
47416,L294381,u1410,m93,ROSE,You still in the market for a real boy?
47417,L294380,u1405,m93,LILA,"I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl."
47418,L294379,u1410,m93,ROSE,"Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt."
47419,L294378,u1405,m93,LILA,Ouch. Yeah?
47420,L294377,u1410,m93,ROSE,Progress!
47421,L295004,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy."
47422,L295003,u1405,m93,LILA,Ooka.
47423,L295002,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit."
47424,L295001,u1405,m93,LILA,Oook. Oook.
47425,L295000,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Look at you two. You both disgust me.
47426,L294995,u1405,m93,LILA,Ugnh.
47427,L294994,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
47428,L294930,u1405,m93,LILA,"Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best."
47429,L294929,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?"
47430,L294928,u1405,m93,LILA,"Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie."
47431,L294876,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Lila...
47432,L294875,u1405,m93,LILA,How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
47433,L294874,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing."
47434,L294873,u1405,m93,LILA,"I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!"
47435,L294872,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Yes.
47436,L294871,u1405,m93,LILA,Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
47437,L294870,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
47438,L294869,u1405,m93,LILA,"And what did you do tonight, honey?"
47439,L294868,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila."
47440,L294867,u1405,m93,LILA,"And what did you do tonight, honey?"
47441,L294866,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Shit.
47442,L294865,u1405,m93,LILA,"That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his ""mad"" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?"
47443,L294864,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
47444,L294863,u1405,m93,LILA,So he's doing okay?
47445,L294862,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila."
47446,L294861,u1405,m93,LILA,You were gone a long time.
47447,L294823,u1405,m93,LILA,Ummm. It's good.
47448,L294822,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
47449,L294821,u1405,m93,LILA,Should I come with?
47450,L294820,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
47451,L294808,u1405,m93,LILA,Absolutely!
47452,L294807,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances."
47453,L294785,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Thank you very much for that.
47454,L294784,u1405,m93,LILA,You just have to control it. We're not apes.
47455,L294766,u1405,m93,LILA,Oh boy!
47456,L294765,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I think he's ready.
47457,L294757,u1405,m93,LILA,That was wonderful!
47458,L294756,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Bravo to you, Puff!"
47459,L294754,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
47460,L294753,u1405,m93,LILA,I had sold my fucking soul.
47461,L294752,u1405,m93,LILA,Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
47462,L294751,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Such as what womanly things?
47463,L294750,u1405,m93,LILA,Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
47464,L294749,u1407,m93,NATHAN,How come?
47465,L294748,u1405,m93,LILA,"Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway."
47466,L294747,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Really?
47467,L294746,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!"
47468,L294745,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Have you?
47469,L294744,u1405,m93,LILA,"Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around."
47470,L294743,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I guess.
47471,L294742,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?"
47472,L294741,u1407,m93,NATHAN,My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
47473,L294740,u1405,m93,LILA,No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
47474,L294739,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?"
47475,L294738,u1405,m93,LILA,How's work?
47476,L294736,u1405,m93,LILA,"I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!"
47477,L294735,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
47478,L294734,u1405,m93,LILA,You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
47479,L294733,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed."
47480,L294732,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in..."
47481,L294704,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!"
47482,L294703,u1407,m93,NATHAN,That's great. It's a great color for you.
47483,L294702,u1405,m93,LILA,I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
47484,L294701,u1407,m93,NATHAN,That's great.
47485,L294700,u1405,m93,LILA,"Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis."
47486,L294699,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Sure. Of course.
47487,L294698,u1405,m93,LILA,Really?
47488,L294697,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want."
47489,L294696,u1405,m93,LILA,"I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want."
47490,L294695,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
47491,L294694,u1405,m93,LILA,Do you like my new look?
47492,L294693,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I'm just preoccupied.
47493,L294692,u1405,m93,LILA,"Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different."
47494,L294691,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No.
47495,L294690,u1405,m93,LILA,It would just be helpful to know.
47496,L294689,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Of course not.
47497,L294688,u1405,m93,LILA,"Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know."
47498,L294681,u1405,m93,LILA,"Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot."
47499,L294680,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late."
47500,L294679,u1405,m93,LILA,"Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk."
47501,L294678,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Good. Making progress.
47502,L294677,u1405,m93,LILA,"So, how's it going today?"
47503,L294667,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
47504,L294666,u1405,m93,LILA,"I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men."
47505,L294665,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female."
47506,L294664,u1405,m93,LILA,You are an animal.
47507,L294663,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?"
47508,L294629,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I have to think! I have to think!
47509,L294628,u1405,m93,LILA,"I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!"
47510,L294627,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
47511,L294626,u1405,m93,LILA,I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
47512,L294625,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
47513,L294624,u1405,m93,LILA,"Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!"
47514,L294623,u1407,m93,NATHAN,You have to shave? Like an ape?
47515,L294622,u1405,m93,LILA,"I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to..."
47516,L294621,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Your entire body?
47517,L294620,u1405,m93,LILA,"It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry."
47518,L294616,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?"
47519,L294615,u1405,m93,LILA,Who from work?
47520,L294614,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly."
47521,L294613,u1405,m93,LILA,Who is it?
47522,L294612,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right."
47523,L294611,u1405,m93,LILA,Who is it?
47524,L294609,u1405,m93,LILA,Nothing. Be right out.
47525,L294608,u1407,m93,NATHAN,What are you doing in there?
47526,L294577,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
47527,L294576,u1405,m93,LILA,All right.
47528,L294575,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon..."
47529,L294572,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson."
47530,L294571,u1405,m93,LILA,"You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan."
47531,L294570,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality."
47532,L294569,u1405,m93,LILA,I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
47533,L294568,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous."
47534,L294567,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan."
47535,L294566,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject."
47536,L294565,u1405,m93,LILA,"Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?"
47537,L294564,u1407,m93,NATHAN,It's perfect!
47538,L294563,u1405,m93,LILA,Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
47539,L294562,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?"
47540,L294561,u1405,m93,LILA,What?
47541,L294560,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Actually, I just had an amusing thought."
47542,L294559,u1405,m93,LILA,"I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your..."
47543,L294558,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do."
47544,L294557,u1405,m93,LILA,He looks perfectly fine.
47545,L294556,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!"
47546,L294555,u1405,m93,LILA,I think he's feral.
47547,L294554,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?"
47548,L294543,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that."
47549,L294542,u1405,m93,LILA,Come on.
47550,L294541,u1407,m93,NATHAN,It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
47551,L294540,u1405,m93,LILA,No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
47552,L294539,u1407,m93,NATHAN,A deer?
47553,L294538,u1405,m93,LILA,I don't know. Something.
47554,L294537,u1407,m93,NATHAN,What?
47555,L294536,u1405,m93,LILA,Did you see that?
47556,L294533,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I love you so much.
47557,L294532,u1405,m93,LILA,That's very funny.
47558,L294531,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"We could call it ""Quit Bugging Me, Sunny.""  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y."
47559,L294530,u1405,m93,LILA,Absolutely.
47560,L294529,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Flares?
47561,L294528,u1405,m93,LILA,Yes.
47562,L294527,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
47563,L294526,u1405,m93,LILA,"Yes, darling."
47564,L294525,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save."
47565,L294524,u1405,m93,LILA,Fifteen.
47566,L294523,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"What SPF, sweetie?"
47567,L294522,u1405,m93,LILA,Of course.
47568,L294521,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Oh, and the sun block?"
47569,L294520,u1405,m93,LILA,"Yes, darling."
47570,L294519,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?"
47571,L294518,u1405,m93,LILA,I don't think so.  Why?
47572,L294517,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Shaving cream?
47573,L294516,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Terrific. Can't wait!
47574,L294515,u1405,m93,LILA,It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
47575,L294514,u1407,m93,NATHAN,That's a great idea.
47576,L294513,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!"
47577,L294512,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Why certainly!
47578,L294511,u1405,m93,LILA,"Do you? Oh do you, darling?"
47579,L294510,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
47580,L294509,u1405,m93,LILA,Do you?
47581,L294508,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
47582,L294507,u1405,m93,LILA,"You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes."
47583,L294506,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I'm sorry about my parents.
47584,L294505,u1405,m93,LILA,I'll be out in a minute.
47585,L294504,u1407,m93,NATHAN,What are you doing in there?
47586,L294495,u1405,m93,LILA,Nathan!
47587,L294494,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible."
47588,L294469,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?"
47589,L294468,u1405,m93,LILA,Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
47590,L294467,u1407,m93,NATHAN,You do?
47591,L294466,u1405,m93,LILA,"I like you, too, Nathan."
47592,L294465,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"It's just that I have some peculiarities, and..."
47593,L294464,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical."
47594,L294463,u1405,m93,LILA,You really enjoy my company?
47595,L294462,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Yes, and..."
47596,L294461,u1405,m93,LILA,You do?
47597,L294460,u1407,m93,NATHAN,It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
47598,L294459,u1405,m93,LILA,"No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas."
47599,L294458,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I'm sorry that I became so upset.
47600,L294457,u1405,m93,LILA,"Boy, this is good!"
47601,L294456,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No biggie.
47602,L294455,u1405,m93,LILA,"Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things."
47603,L294454,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses."
47604,L294453,u1405,m93,LILA,I'm sorry?
47605,L294452,u1407,m93,NATHAN,My God! The fork! The fork!
47606,L294451,u1405,m93,LILA,"Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish..."
47607,L294450,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ..."
47608,L294449,u1405,m93,LILA,It looks wonderful.
47609,L294426,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world."
47610,L294425,u1405,m93,LILA,We are animals after all.
47611,L294424,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm."
47612,L294423,u1405,m93,LILA,I'm not sure.
47613,L294422,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels."
47614,L294421,u1405,m93,LILA,"Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?"
47615,L294420,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans."
47616,L294419,u1405,m93,LILA,What's the larger experiment?
47617,L294418,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
47618,L294417,u1405,m93,LILA,Paper or cloth?
47619,L294416,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course."
47620,L294415,u1405,m93,LILA,How's it going?
47621,L294414,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid."
47622,L294413,u1405,m93,LILA,"I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan."
47623,L294412,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment."
47624,L294411,u1405,m93,LILA,"You are a therapist, right?"
47625,L294410,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
47626,L294409,u1405,m93,LILA,I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
47627,L294408,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
47628,L294407,u1405,m93,LILA,That's not necessarily a bad thing.
47629,L294406,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
47630,L294405,u1405,m93,LILA,Where?
47631,L294404,u1407,m93,NATHAN,I have to say that I'm not there yet.
47632,L294403,u1405,m93,LILA,You've got to respect that.
47633,L294402,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true."
47634,L294401,u1405,m93,LILA,"They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, ""Ewww. A slug."""
47635,L294400,u1407,m93,NATHAN,As do I.
47636,L294399,u1405,m93,LILA,"Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs."
47637,L294398,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
47638,L295013,u1407,m93,NATHAN,No.
47639,L295012,u1409,m93,PUFF,"You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you."
47640,L295011,u1409,m93,PUFF,I have to talk. Is that okay?
47641,L295010,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again."
47642,L295009,u1409,m93,PUFF,Unka unka unka unka unka.
47643,L295008,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?"
47644,L295007,u1409,m93,PUFF,Ounpoo. Ungh.
47645,L295006,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Puff, put the gun down."
47646,L294999,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
47647,L294998,u1409,m93,PUFF,Unn.
47648,L294997,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject."
47649,L294996,u1409,m93,PUFF,Ugnh.
47650,L294921,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?"
47651,L294920,u1409,m93,PUFF,Interesting.
47652,L294914,u1409,m93,PUFF,"here, here."
47653,L294913,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support."
47654,L294912,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance."
47655,L294911,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Thanks to you, Nate."
47656,L294898,u1409,m93,PUFF,"It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to..."
47657,L294897,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage."
47658,L294819,u1409,m93,PUFF,Got it.
47659,L294818,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do."
47660,L294817,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you."
47661,L294816,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing."
47662,L294815,u1409,m93,PUFF,It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
47663,L294814,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Free to come and go as you please. There's some ""mad money"" in the night table drawer."
47664,L294812,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Even better.
47665,L294811,u1409,m93,PUFF,Extra dessert?
47666,L294810,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you."
47667,L294809,u1409,m93,PUFF,"Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!"
47668,L294797,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Tomorrow, the acid test."
47669,L294796,u1409,m93,PUFF,Yahoo!
47670,L294795,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight."
47671,L294789,u1407,m93,NATHAN,Lila?
47672,L294788,u1409,m93,PUFF,I bow to your expertise in these matters.
47673,L294787,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world."
47674,L294786,u1409,m93,PUFF,"I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem."
47675,L294775,u1409,m93,PUFF,"I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors."
47676,L294774,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"This is great, Puff. You're doing fine."
47677,L294769,u1409,m93,PUFF,Okay. That's fair.
47678,L294768,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case."
47679,L294767,u1409,m93,PUFF,Oh boy!
47680,L294714,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Bravo, Puff! Bravo!"
47681,L294713,u1409,m93,PUFF,Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
47682,L294712,u1411,m93,WENDALL,And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
47683,L294711,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?"
47684,L294710,u1411,m93,WENDALL,I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
47685,L294709,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha."
47686,L294708,u1411,m93,WENDALL,"Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair."
47687,L294707,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"No, why?"
47688,L294706,u1411,m93,WENDALL,Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
47689,L294705,u1407,m93,NATHAN,"So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately."
47690,L295042,u1409,m93,PUFF,"I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines."
47691,L295041,u1408,m93,OLDER WOMAN,"I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something."
47692,L295040,u1409,m93,PUFF,Yes.
47693,L295039,u1408,m93,OLDER WOMAN,"Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though."
47694,L295038,u1409,m93,PUFF,"It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever."
47695,L295037,u1408,m93,OLDER WOMAN,Yes... Derek.
47696,L295036,u1409,m93,PUFF,Mother?
47697,L295035,u1408,m93,OLDER WOMAN,"I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man."
47698,L295034,u1409,m93,PUFF,Yes?
47699,L295033,u1408,m93,OLDER WOMAN,Wait!
47700,L295489,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,It's open...  What'll you have?
47701,L295488,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Huh?
47702,L295482,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,Right.
47703,L295481,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Give me a bottle of beer.
47704,L295298,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You look different... More relaxed.
47705,L295297,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,Check!
47706,L295296,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady."
47707,L295288,u1416,m94,EDDIE,No.
47708,L295287,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,You want a chaser?
47709,L295286,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
47710,L295082,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Next game, ten bucks."
47711,L295081,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,"About sixty, seventy bucks."
47712,L295074,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?"
47713,L295073,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,"Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours."
47714,L295070,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,What do you guys sell?
47715,L295069,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
47716,L295068,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,Comin' in or goin' out?
47717,L295067,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Mm hmm.
47718,L295066,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,Pittsburgh?
47719,L295065,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yep.
47720,L295064,u1412,m94,BARTENDER,Boys just passing through?
47721,L295911,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all."
47722,L295910,u1413,m94,BERT,All I want's the money.
47723,L295909,u1420,m94,SARAH,"And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?"
47724,L295908,u1413,m94,BERT,That's the way it's done.
47725,L295907,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?"
47726,L295906,u1413,m94,BERT,"It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money."
47727,L295905,u1420,m94,SARAH,"In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?"
47728,L295790,u1420,m94,SARAH,Thank you.
47729,L295789,u1413,m94,BERT,Are you ready for another?
47730,L295777,u1413,m94,BERT,You tell me.
47731,L295776,u1420,m94,SARAH,How?
47732,L295775,u1413,m94,BERT,I'll make it up to you.
47733,L295774,u1413,m94,BERT,"Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can."
47734,L295773,u1420,m94,SARAH,You bastard.
47735,L295772,u1413,m94,BERT,"Well, nobody has to sell."
47736,L295771,u1420,m94,SARAH,"No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap."
47737,L295770,u1413,m94,BERT,"All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself."
47738,L295769,u1420,m94,SARAH,You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
47739,L295768,u1413,m94,BERT,"For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory."
47740,L295767,u1420,m94,SARAH,For whom and for what?
47741,L295766,u1413,m94,BERT,To win.
47742,L295765,u1420,m94,SARAH,You know what's good for him?
47743,L295764,u1413,m94,BERT,"Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie."
47744,L295763,u1420,m94,SARAH,Do we need words?
47745,L295762,u1413,m94,BERT,I want to talk to you.
47746,L295761,u1420,m94,SARAH,We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
47747,L295760,u1413,m94,BERT,"Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard."
47748,L295742,u1413,m94,BERT,"She's a smart girl, Eddie."
47749,L295741,u1420,m94,SARAH,And a fact is a fact.
47750,L295740,u1413,m94,BERT,"That's right, Miss Packard."
47751,L295739,u1420,m94,SARAH,"It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech."
47752,L295735,u1413,m94,BERT,"Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?"
47753,L295734,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?"
47754,L295732,u1413,m94,BERT,"I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?"
47755,L295731,u1420,m94,SARAH,What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
47756,L295721,u1413,m94,BERT,Soon as I finish my coffee.
47757,L295720,u1420,m94,SARAH,I'm ready.
47758,L295714,u1413,m94,BERT,Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
47759,L295713,u1420,m94,SARAH,I've never been to Louisville.
47760,L295712,u1413,m94,BERT,"You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?"
47761,L295711,u1420,m94,SARAH,"No, I'm fine."
47762,L295710,u1413,m94,BERT,It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
47763,L295709,u1420,m94,SARAH,Packard. Sarah Packard.
47764,L295708,u1413,m94,BERT,"You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?"
47765,L295888,u1413,m94,BERT,Twelve thousand.
47766,L295887,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,How much do I owe you?
47767,L295886,u1413,m94,BERT,Cash.
47768,L295885,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Will you take a check, Bert?"
47769,L295861,u1413,m94,BERT,The night is two thousand dollars old.
47770,L295860,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,That seems a shame. The night is young.
47771,L295854,u1413,m94,BERT,It's possible.
47772,L295853,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist."
47773,L295850,u1413,m94,BERT,"I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things."
47774,L295849,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?"
47775,L295848,u1413,m94,BERT,Do you really think you can beat him?
47776,L295847,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Oh, about five hundred."
47777,L295846,u1413,m94,BERT,How much?
47778,L295834,u1413,m94,BERT,Deal the cards.
47779,L295833,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
47780,L295830,u1413,m94,BERT,You ever played billiards before?
47781,L295829,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game."
47782,L295813,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Good, good."
47783,L295812,u1413,m94,BERT,We'll be there.
47784,L295805,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards."
47785,L295804,u1413,m94,BERT,Could be.
47786,L295962,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya."
47787,L295961,u1413,m94,BERT,"If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was."
47788,L295960,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Boy, we really gave it to her good."
47789,L295959,u1413,m94,BERT,Aaaahhhh!
47790,L295958,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?"
47791,L295957,u1413,m94,BERT,"No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five."
47792,L295956,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Fifty per cent?
47793,L295955,u1413,m94,BERT,"Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on."
47794,L295954,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?"
47795,L295953,u1413,m94,BERT,"I'm a businessman, kid."
47796,L295952,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"So you figure you're still my manager, huh?"
47797,L295950,u1413,m94,BERT,"You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places."
47798,L295949,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"What if I don't pay ya, Bert?"
47799,L295948,u1413,m94,BERT,"Well, here it's half."
47800,L295947,u1416,m94,EDDIE,In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
47801,L295946,u1413,m94,BERT,Half.
47802,L295945,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?"
47803,L295944,u1413,m94,BERT,Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
47804,L295903,u1413,m94,BERT,"You gotta be hard, Eddie."
47805,L295902,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Tell her what?
47806,L295901,u1413,m94,BERT,You want me to tell her for you?
47807,L295900,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I got time, Bert."
47808,L295899,u1413,m94,BERT,It's a long walk.
47809,L295898,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I wanna walk.
47810,L295875,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now."
47811,L295874,u1413,m94,BERT,"I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit."
47812,L295873,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Please don't get off me now.
47813,L295866,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"All right, then. I'll play him with my own money."
47814,L295865,u1413,m94,BERT,"I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser."
47815,L295864,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him."
47816,L295863,u1413,m94,BERT,I said we're leavin'.
47817,L295862,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!"
47818,L295859,u1413,m94,BERT,"Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'."
47819,L295858,u1416,m94,EDDIE,They're fine.
47820,L295857,u1413,m94,BERT,How're the hands?
47821,L295856,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I'll beat him the next game.
47822,L295852,u1413,m94,BERT,All right. Five hundred.
47823,L295851,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I can beat him.
47824,L295843,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it."
47825,L295842,u1413,m94,BERT,"Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?"
47826,L295841,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him."
47827,L295840,u1413,m94,BERT,I don't know.
47828,L295839,u1416,m94,EDDIE,When do I raise the bet?
47829,L295838,u1413,m94,BERT,'Bout even.
47830,L295837,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How do we stand?
47831,L295832,u1413,m94,BERT,You hustlin' me?
47832,L295831,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Sure.
47833,L295828,u1413,m94,BERT,How much?
47834,L295827,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"C'mon, Bert. Let me play him."
47835,L295826,u1413,m94,BERT,"Well, we won't."
47836,L295819,u1413,m94,BERT,"It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off."
47837,L295818,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What's the matter? What happened?
47838,L295800,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, I win sometimes."
47839,L295799,u1413,m94,BERT,So does Eddie.
47840,L295788,u1413,m94,BERT,Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
47841,L295787,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
47842,L295786,u1413,m94,BERT,Over there by the bar.
47843,L295785,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Where?
47844,L295784,u1413,m94,BERT,"Hey, Findley's here."
47845,L295753,u1413,m94,BERT,"Come on, let's go..."
47846,L295752,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes."
47847,L295738,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, whaddya say something like that for?"
47848,L295737,u1413,m94,BERT,Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
47849,L295736,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Fine.
47850,L295730,u1413,m94,BERT,"Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose."
47851,L295729,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times."
47852,L295728,u1413,m94,BERT,"Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart."
47853,L295727,u1413,m94,BERT,"No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs."
47854,L295726,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Here, I got it."
47855,L295725,u1413,m94,BERT,"Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished."
47856,L295724,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What's that supposed to mean?
47857,L295723,u1413,m94,BERT,I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
47858,L295722,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You must have a lot of confidence in me.
47859,L295719,u1413,m94,BERT,I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
47860,L295718,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How good is he?
47861,L295717,u1413,m94,BERT,"He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes."
47862,L295716,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What? And he -- he hustles pool?
47863,L295715,u1413,m94,BERT,James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
47864,L295705,u1413,m94,BERT,Miss Packard. How do you do?
47865,L295704,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
47866,L295661,u1413,m94,BERT,"Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown."
47867,L295660,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
47868,L295659,u1413,m94,BERT,Thinking about what?
47869,L295658,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I been thinking.
47870,L295657,u1413,m94,BERT,"No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs."
47871,L295656,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Like I told ya. My thumbs.
47872,L295655,u1413,m94,BERT,What happened to you anyway?
47873,L295654,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You name the place, boss. I'll be there."
47874,L295653,u1413,m94,BERT,"The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky."
47875,L295652,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Where do I sign?
47876,L295651,u1413,m94,BERT,Sign up.
47877,L295650,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
47878,L295649,u1413,m94,BERT,"Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays."
47879,L295648,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You know everybody, don't you?"
47880,L295647,u1413,m94,BERT,Man named Turk Baker?
47881,L295646,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
47882,L295645,u1413,m94,BERT,What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
47883,L295644,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
47884,L295643,u1413,m94,BERT,Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
47885,L295642,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
47886,L295641,u1413,m94,BERT,"Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?"
47887,L295640,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Hi. How's business?
47888,L295639,u1413,m94,BERT,"Hello, Eddie."
47889,L295562,u1413,m94,BERT,I don't know when it was.
47890,L295561,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Now, when did you adopt me?"
47891,L295560,u1413,m94,BERT,"Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive."
47892,L295559,u1416,m94,EDDIE,There are places. I'll scuffle around.
47893,L295558,u1413,m94,BERT,"Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?"
47894,L295557,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Kiss off.
47895,L295556,u1413,m94,BERT,"No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it."
47896,L295555,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk."
47897,L295554,u1413,m94,BERT,"I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent."
47898,L295553,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
47899,L295552,u1413,m94,BERT,"Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way."
47900,L295551,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
47901,L295550,u1413,m94,BERT,I never saw you do anything else.
47902,L295549,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You think I can lose?
47903,L295548,u1413,m94,BERT,"How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win."
47904,L295547,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?"
47905,L295546,u1413,m94,BERT,For me.
47906,L295545,u1416,m94,EDDIE,For who?
47907,L295544,u1413,m94,BERT,Seventy-five per cent.
47908,L295543,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?"
47909,L295542,u1413,m94,BERT,Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
47910,L295541,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Why?
47911,L295540,u1413,m94,BERT,Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
47912,L295539,u1416,m94,EDDIE,To do what?
47913,L295538,u1413,m94,BERT,Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
47914,L295537,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Thanks for the drink.
47915,L295536,u1413,m94,BERT,"Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers."
47916,L295535,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I told you. I got drunk.
47917,L295534,u1413,m94,BERT,"First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off."
47918,L295533,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What's that supposed to mean?
47919,L295532,u1413,m94,BERT,"Eddie, you're a born loser."
47920,L295531,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Whaddya been so far?
47921,L295530,u1413,m94,BERT,"Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?"
47922,L295529,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"In that case, you owe me another drink."
47923,L295528,u1413,m94,BERT,"See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over."
47924,L295527,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
47925,L295526,u1413,m94,BERT,"No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it."
47926,L295525,u1416,m94,EDDIE,A thousand.
47927,L295524,u1413,m94,BERT,"Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?"
47928,L295523,u1416,m94,EDDIE,So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
47929,L295522,u1413,m94,BERT,That's your problem.
47930,L295521,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?"
47931,L295520,u1413,m94,BERT,"You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?"
47932,L295519,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Maybe he knows how to drink.
47933,L295518,u1413,m94,BERT,He drank as much whisky as you did.
47934,L295517,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I got drunk.
47935,L295516,u1413,m94,BERT,"You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body."
47936,L295515,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah. Sure, sure."
47937,L295514,u1413,m94,BERT,Character.
47938,L295513,u1416,m94,EDDIE,So I got talent. So what beat me?
47939,L295512,u1413,m94,BERT,I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
47940,L295511,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You being cute?
47941,L295510,u1413,m94,BERT,Pool.
47942,L295509,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What is?
47943,L295508,u1413,m94,BERT,Poker's not your game.
47944,L295507,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I lost twenty bucks.
47945,L295506,u1413,m94,BERT,"I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?"
47946,L295505,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yeah? Why?
47947,L295504,u1413,m94,BERT,Only when I work.
47948,L295503,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Thought you only drank milk.
47949,L295502,u1413,m94,BERT,I'm buyin'.
47950,L295501,u1413,m94,BERT,Two.
47951,L295500,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
47952,L295499,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Deal.
47953,L295498,u1413,m94,BERT,Cut.
47954,L295497,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Make it twenty.
47955,L295492,u1413,m94,BERT,Sit down.
47956,L295491,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Okay?
47957,L295230,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What did he say?
47958,L295229,u1413,m94,BERT,Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
47959,L295213,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
47960,L295212,u1413,m94,BERT,The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
47961,L295211,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, mister."
47962,L295149,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,"Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you."
47963,L295148,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Just tell me where I can find him, friend."
47964,L295147,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,"Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend."
47965,L295146,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You got that wrong, mister. I am."
47966,L295143,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,"You well-heeled, partner?"
47967,L295142,u1416,m94,EDDIE,He's my partner.
47968,L295139,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,Want some free advice?
47969,L295138,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, that's right."
47970,L295137,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
47971,L295136,u1416,m94,EDDIE,The expensive kind.
47972,L295135,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,What kind of straight pool game you like?
47973,L295134,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?"
47974,L295133,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,"Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me."
47975,L295132,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You name it, we shoot it."
47976,L295131,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,What's your game? What do you shoot?
47977,L295130,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Who's he?
47978,L295129,u1414,m94,BIG JOHN,"No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?"
47979,L295128,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Maybe. You want to play?
47980,L295456,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yeah. Just like that.
47981,L295455,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Just like that?
47982,L295454,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
47983,L295453,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
47984,L295452,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, that's what I think."
47985,L295451,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Is that what you think?
47986,L295450,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?"
47987,L295449,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?"
47988,L295448,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, to play Fats again."
47989,L295447,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,What for? To play Fats again?
47990,L295446,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money."
47991,L295445,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Aw, Eddie."
47992,L295444,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie."
47993,L295443,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
47994,L295442,u1416,m94,EDDIE,HOW MUCH?!
47995,L295440,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
47996,L295439,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Oh yeah? Where?
47997,L295438,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
47998,L295437,u1416,m94,EDDIE,With what?
47999,L295435,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along."
48000,L295434,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I told you you'd get your money back.
48001,L295433,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
48002,L295432,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation."
48003,L295431,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
48004,L295430,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
48005,L295429,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?"
48006,L295428,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
48007,L295427,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,I want you to come back on the road with me.
48008,L295426,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Talk to me, Charlie."
48009,L295425,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, ""This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."""
48010,L295424,u1416,m94,EDDIE,A son.
48011,L295423,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --"
48012,L295422,u1416,m94,EDDIE,So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
48013,L295421,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
48014,L295420,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you."
48015,L295419,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody."
48016,L295416,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,I asked around.
48017,L295415,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
48018,L295414,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you."
48019,L295413,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl."
48020,L295254,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"If that's all you got, that's all we got left."
48021,L295253,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Is this all we got left?
48022,L295247,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Okay, here...  Be a damn fool."
48023,L295246,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine."
48024,L295245,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Go to hell.
48025,L295244,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Go on home. Just leave me the money.
48026,L295243,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken."
48027,L295242,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"What are ya, chicken, Charlie?"
48028,L295241,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?"
48029,L295234,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
48030,L295233,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,You don't need a drink.
48031,L295232,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Give me a drink, will ya?"
48032,L295231,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight."
48033,L295226,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?"
48034,L295225,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Get with what?
48035,L295224,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?"
48036,L295223,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
48037,L295222,u1416,m94,EDDIE,The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
48038,L295221,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Eddie...
48039,L295220,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"No, it isn't, Charlie."
48040,L295219,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
48041,L295218,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?"
48042,L295217,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket."
48043,L295216,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How much we got?
48044,L295202,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game."
48045,L295201,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Approximately? One thousand bucks.
48046,L295200,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, how much are we ahead?"
48047,L295190,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Charlie, I'm gonna take him."
48048,L295189,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Quit. He's too good.
48049,L295171,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I feel tight -- but good.
48050,L295170,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"In the gut, I mean."
48051,L295169,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Fast and loose, man."
48052,L295168,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,How do you feel?
48053,L295125,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game."
48054,L295124,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
48055,L295123,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?"
48056,L295115,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie."
48057,L295114,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
48058,L295113,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler."
48059,L295112,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,It's quiet.
48060,L295104,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up."
48061,L295103,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
48062,L295102,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well... well, now."
48063,L295100,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,I don't want it.
48064,L295099,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table."
48065,L295098,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
48066,L295097,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Whaddya mean?
48067,L295096,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more."
48068,L295095,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again."
48069,L295091,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
48070,L295090,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
48071,L295089,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,Why?
48072,L295088,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before."
48073,L295087,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
48074,L295086,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?"
48075,L295085,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
48076,L295076,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue."
48077,L295075,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
48078,L295072,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself."
48079,L295071,u1415,m94,CHARLIE,"Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory."
48080,L295894,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yeah. Sure.
48081,L295893,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,Yeah. You must come again.
48082,L295892,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat."
48083,L295891,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I..."
48084,L295890,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, sure has."
48085,L295889,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
48086,L295871,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now."
48087,L295870,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson."
48088,L295869,u1416,m94,EDDIE,There it is. I'm broke.
48089,L295845,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Okay?
48090,L295844,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?"
48091,L295836,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh no, nothing for me."
48092,L295835,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?"
48093,L295825,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to."
48094,L295824,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I thought we came here to play pool.
48095,L295823,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,By all means.
48096,L295822,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"No, none for me. Come on, let's play."
48097,L295821,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,You gentlemen care for a drink?
48098,L295811,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play."
48099,L295810,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What time?
48100,L295809,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,Would you like to come out tonight?
48101,L295808,u1416,m94,EDDIE,That's right. When?
48102,L295807,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"You're very direct, Mr. Felson."
48103,L295806,u1416,m94,EDDIE,When?
48104,L295803,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition."
48105,L295802,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How much?
48106,L295801,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do."
48107,L295798,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose."
48108,L295797,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Now and then. Why, do you?"
48109,L295796,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?"
48110,L295795,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Glad to meet you.
48111,L295794,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,Findley.
48112,L295792,u1418,m94,FINDLEY,"Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time."
48113,L295791,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"No, no more for me."
48114,L295496,u1419,m94,PLAYER,Ten dollars.
48115,L295495,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Gimme ten bucks.
48116,L295494,u1419,m94,PLAYER,Half and a dollar.
48117,L295493,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What's the limit?
48118,L295350,u1419,m94,PLAYER,"Oh man, you're way out of our league."
48119,L295349,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket."
48120,L295348,u1419,m94,PLAYER,"Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night."
48121,L295347,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Who's he?
48122,L295346,u1419,m94,PLAYER,"Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?"
48123,L295345,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?"
48124,L295597,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"Yeah, I'm quittin'."
48125,L295596,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You quittin', friend?"
48126,L295591,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat."
48127,L295590,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"You better not miss, friend."
48128,L295588,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,Heads.
48129,L295587,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Call it.
48130,L295586,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"Okay, friend. You're on."
48131,L295585,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits."
48132,L295584,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"You sure you don't want to quit, friend?"
48133,L295583,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,Okay.
48134,L295582,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Shoot.
48135,L295581,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,Try me.
48136,L295580,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler."
48137,L295579,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?"
48138,L295578,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me."
48139,L295577,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"I guess it's just you and me, huh?"
48140,L295576,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Couple of bucks.
48141,L295575,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,How much are you ahead?
48142,L295574,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You're a pretty good player.
48143,L295573,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,You quittin' too?
48144,L295570,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"Okay, friend."
48145,L295569,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks."
48146,L295568,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,"A dollar on the five, two on the nine."
48147,L295567,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How much you playin' for?
48148,L295564,u1421,m94,YOUNG MAN,Hi.
48149,L295563,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Hi.
48150,L295883,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!"
48151,L295882,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't."
48152,L295881,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Shut up.
48153,L295880,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled."
48154,L295879,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel."
48155,L295878,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Please, Eddie, don't beg him."
48156,L295877,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Go on back to the hotel.
48157,L295816,u1420,m94,SARAH,I'm a little tired.
48158,L295815,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, what's the matter?"
48159,L295814,u1420,m94,SARAH,If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
48160,L295783,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Just for luck.
48161,L295782,u1420,m94,SARAH,Why?
48162,L295781,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it."
48163,L295780,u1420,m94,SARAH,He went off someplace.
48164,L295779,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Where's Bert?
48165,L295759,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I'll be up later.
48166,L295758,u1420,m94,SARAH,Fifty-seven.
48167,L295702,u1420,m94,SARAH,"No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real."
48168,L295701,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?"
48169,L295700,u1420,m94,SARAH,"I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you."
48170,L295699,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street."
48171,L295698,u1420,m94,SARAH,"What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?"
48172,L295697,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it."
48173,L295696,u1420,m94,SARAH,"If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me."
48174,L295695,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back."
48175,L295694,u1420,m94,SARAH,Why should I?
48176,L295693,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh, grow up."
48177,L295692,u1420,m94,SARAH,Leave now.
48178,L295691,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning."
48179,L295690,u1420,m94,SARAH,"No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask."
48180,L295689,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Don't you want to know where I'm going?
48181,L295687,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Come here. Come on, now."
48182,L295686,u1420,m94,SARAH,"No, I want to walk."
48183,L295684,u1420,m94,SARAH,Sure. Let's go home.
48184,L295683,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"More like a week. Look, I'll be back."
48185,L295682,u1420,m94,SARAH,A week? A year?
48186,L295681,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh, I don't know."
48187,L295680,u1420,m94,SARAH,For how long?
48188,L295679,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while."
48189,L295678,u1420,m94,SARAH,What do you want to tell me?
48190,L295677,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Nothin'.  Want another drink?
48191,L295676,u1420,m94,SARAH,"What is it, Eddie?"
48192,L295672,u1416,m94,EDDIE,First time for everything.
48193,L295671,u1420,m94,SARAH,Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
48194,L295670,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, what's so funny?"
48195,L295669,u1420,m94,SARAH,I feel pretty.
48196,L295668,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
48197,L295667,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Sherry.  Very old, very dry."
48198,L295638,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Yes, I'm glad."
48199,L295637,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You glad?
48200,L295636,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back."
48201,L295635,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You need the words?
48202,L295634,u1420,m94,SARAH,I love you.
48203,L295633,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler."
48204,L295632,u1420,m94,SARAH,"You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie."
48205,L295631,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before."
48206,L295630,u1420,m94,SARAH,Does it bother you? What he said?
48207,L295629,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, what else does?"
48208,L295628,u1420,m94,SARAH,Is that what makes a winner?
48209,L295627,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, he owns things."
48210,L295626,u1420,m94,SARAH,Is he a winner?
48211,L295625,u1416,m94,EDDIE,He's a gambler.
48212,L295624,u1420,m94,SARAH,"What does he do, this Bert Gordon?"
48213,L295623,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose."
48214,L295622,u1420,m94,SARAH,Why did he tell you?
48215,L295621,u1416,m94,EDDIE,He knows. A lot.
48216,L295620,u1420,m94,SARAH,Would he know?
48217,L295619,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser."
48218,L295618,u1420,m94,SARAH,A loser?
48219,L295617,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?"
48220,L295615,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What's it so hot in here for?
48221,L295614,u1420,m94,SARAH,No. You?
48222,L295613,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You wanna drink?
48223,L295612,u1420,m94,SARAH,"You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?"
48224,L295608,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
48225,L295607,u1420,m94,SARAH,What happened?
48226,L295606,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Me. It's Eddie.
48227,L295605,u1420,m94,SARAH,Who is it?
48228,L295479,u1420,m94,SARAH,That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
48229,L295478,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
48230,L295477,u1420,m94,SARAH,"You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?"
48231,L295474,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"What's this supposed to mean: ""We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."""
48232,L295473,u1420,m94,SARAH,Give it back to me.
48233,L295472,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What's this supposed to mean?
48234,L295471,u1420,m94,SARAH,Give it to me.
48235,L295470,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up."
48236,L295469,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What are you writing?
48237,L295465,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yeah. For a little while.
48238,L295464,u1420,m94,SARAH,You going out?
48239,L295418,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?"
48240,L295417,u1420,m94,SARAH,Do you want me to go?
48241,L295411,u1420,m94,SARAH,From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
48242,L295410,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?"
48243,L295409,u1420,m94,SARAH,"No, why should I? It's yours."
48244,L295408,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Haven't you opened it?
48245,L295407,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Eddie, what's in that case?"
48246,L295406,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Oh, it's not bad."
48247,L295405,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I've got something in my bag.
48248,L295404,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Oh, cut my finger."
48249,L295403,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Raw.
48250,L295402,u1420,m94,SARAH,Eggs. How do you like them?
48251,L295401,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Don't you ever cook anything?
48252,L295400,u1420,m94,SARAH,The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
48253,L295399,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score."
48254,L295398,u1420,m94,SARAH,"When you've got money, you'll pay."
48255,L295397,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What did all this stuff cost you?
48256,L295396,u1420,m94,SARAH,Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
48257,L295395,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I'm hungry.
48258,L295394,u1420,m94,SARAH,I'm getting treatments right here.
48259,L295393,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments."
48260,L295392,u1420,m94,SARAH,When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
48261,L295391,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You got it all in your head?
48262,L295390,u1420,m94,SARAH,Mm hmm.
48263,L295389,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?"
48264,L295388,u1420,m94,SARAH,You want to go with me?
48265,L295387,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, I believe you when you say you go to school."
48266,L295386,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Museums... art galleries... concerts.
48267,L295385,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Eddie, where do you go when you go out?"
48268,L295384,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Thanks.
48269,L295383,u1420,m94,SARAH,"You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, ""Listen, I got a fella."""
48270,L295381,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours."
48271,L295380,u1420,m94,SARAH,You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
48272,L295379,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Oh, I forgot."
48273,L295378,u1420,m94,SARAH,At school. It's Thursday.
48274,L295377,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Where you been all day?
48275,L295374,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, what do you want to know? And why?"
48276,L295373,u1420,m94,SARAH,I'm not sure... I don't know.
48277,L295372,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
48278,L295371,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone."
48279,L295370,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Okay. So what's your name today?
48280,L295369,u1420,m94,SARAH,I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
48281,L295368,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You told me.
48282,L295367,u1420,m94,SARAH,How did you know my name was Sarah?
48283,L295366,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"What did you say that for, Sarah?"
48284,L295365,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house."
48285,L295364,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Come here.
48286,L295363,u1420,m94,SARAH,Why?
48287,L295362,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
48288,L295361,u1420,m94,SARAH,What time is it?
48289,L295360,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Give me a drag.
48290,L295359,u1420,m94,SARAH,"A day like any other. People come, people go."
48291,L295358,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
48292,L295357,u1420,m94,SARAH,Why did you do that?
48293,L295334,u1416,m94,EDDIE,No. I'll take you home.
48294,L295333,u1420,m94,SARAH,"What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?"
48295,L295332,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Fifth of scotch?
48296,L295331,u1420,m94,SARAH,No.
48297,L295330,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I could always get us a bottle.
48298,L295329,u1420,m94,SARAH,I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
48299,L295328,u1416,m94,EDDIE,I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
48300,L295327,u1420,m94,SARAH,The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
48301,L295326,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Eddie. The name is Eddie.
48302,L295325,u1420,m94,SARAH,"No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?"
48303,L295324,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Hey!
48304,L295323,u1420,m94,SARAH,I drink.
48305,L295322,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What do you do on the other days?
48306,L295321,u1420,m94,SARAH,I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
48307,L295320,u1416,m94,EDDIE,So why go to college?
48308,L295319,u1420,m94,SARAH,I'm not.
48309,L295318,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough."
48310,L295317,u1420,m94,SARAH,I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
48311,L295316,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You don't look like a college girl.
48312,L295315,u1420,m94,SARAH,"I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college."
48313,L295314,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yeah? What do you do now?
48314,L295313,u1420,m94,SARAH,I used to be an actress.
48315,L295312,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You talk kind of funny, but I like it."
48316,L295309,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?"
48317,L295308,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"No, not always."
48318,L295307,u1420,m94,SARAH,Do you always ask so many questions?
48319,L295306,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?"
48320,L295305,u1420,m94,SARAH,"I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?"
48321,L295304,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Around.
48322,L295303,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?"
48323,L295302,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Then why go to the bus station?
48324,L295301,u1420,m94,SARAH,I wasn't waiting for a bus.
48325,L295300,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How come you didn't catch your bus?
48326,L295299,u1420,m94,SARAH,It's the lights. And the scotch.
48327,L295295,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Can I buy you another drink?
48328,L295294,u1420,m94,SARAH,Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
48329,L295293,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast."
48330,L295292,u1420,m94,SARAH,Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
48331,L295291,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Can I sit down?
48332,L295290,u1420,m94,SARAH,Fair.
48333,L295289,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Have a nice trip?
48334,L295282,u1420,m94,SARAH,Thanks. I will.
48335,L295281,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Have a nice trip.
48336,L295279,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't."
48337,L295278,u1420,m94,SARAH,"That wouldn't give us much time, would it?"
48338,L295277,u1420,m94,SARAH,Eight o'clock.
48339,L295276,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Yours.
48340,L295275,u1420,m94,SARAH,What bus?
48341,L295274,u1416,m94,EDDIE,What time does the bus leave?
48342,L295273,u1420,m94,SARAH,"Fine, thanks."
48343,L295272,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?"
48344,L295271,u1420,m94,SARAH,Since four.
48345,L295270,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How long have you been waiting?
48346,L295269,u1420,m94,SARAH,What?
48347,L295268,u1416,m94,EDDIE,How long you been waiting?
48348,L295267,u1420,m94,SARAH,Yes.
48349,L295266,u1416,m94,EDDIE,Long wait for a bus?
48350,L295968,u1417,m94,FATS,"So do you, Fast Eddie."
48351,L295967,u1416,m94,EDDIE,...you shoot a great game of pool.
48352,L295942,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?"
48353,L295941,u1417,m94,FATS,"I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player."
48354,L295936,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot."
48355,L295935,u1417,m94,FATS,"Shoot pool, Fast Eddie."
48356,L295927,u1417,m94,FATS,Let's go.
48357,L295926,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland."
48358,L295925,u1417,m94,FATS,Thousand dollars a game.
48359,L295924,u1416,m94,EDDIE,You name it.
48360,L295923,u1417,m94,FATS,"That's good, Eddie. For how much?"
48361,L295922,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"I came to play pool, Fats."
48362,L295259,u1417,m94,FATS,You watch me.
48363,L295258,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me."
48364,L295257,u1417,m94,FATS,"Game's over, Eddie."
48365,L295256,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here."
48366,L295205,u1417,m94,FATS,Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
48367,L295204,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass."
48368,L295203,u1417,m94,FATS,"Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice."
48369,L295196,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it."
48370,L295195,u1417,m94,FATS,Very good shot.
48371,L295194,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket."
48372,L295193,u1417,m94,FATS,That's what the game's all about.
48373,L295192,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?"
48374,L295191,u1417,m94,FATS,Your shot.
48375,L295181,u1417,m94,FATS,Nine ball.  Three ball.
48376,L295180,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something."
48377,L295179,u1417,m94,FATS,Twelve. Cross side.
48378,L295178,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer."
48379,L295167,u1417,m94,FATS,"Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!"
48380,L295166,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game."
48381,L295165,u1417,m94,FATS,Hundred dollars?
48382,L295164,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool."
48383,L295163,u1417,m94,FATS,"Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?"
48384,L295162,u1417,m94,FATS,Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
48385,L295161,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yeah. That's right, too."
48386,L295160,u1417,m94,FATS,I hear you've been looking for me.
48387,L295159,u1416,m94,EDDIE,That's right.
48388,L295158,u1417,m94,FATS,California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
48389,L295157,u1416,m94,EDDIE,California. Oakland.
48390,L295156,u1417,m94,FATS,Where do you come from?
48391,L295155,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls."
48392,L295154,u1417,m94,FATS,Is that a fact?
48393,L295153,u1416,m94,EDDIE,"You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from."
48394,L295152,u1417,m94,FATS,Now and then. You know how it is.
48395,L296577,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
48396,L296576,u1422,m95,EMMA,You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
48397,L296575,u1422,m95,EMMA,I want to talk.  I just learned again.
48398,L296574,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Shhh... don't talk.
48399,L296573,u1422,m95,EMMA,He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
48400,L296572,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Emma...
48401,L296558,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Yes.
48402,L296557,u1422,m95,EMMA,Do you still want me to stay?
48403,L296556,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Yes.
48404,L296555,u1422,m95,EMMA,You want me to stay?
48405,L296550,u1422,m95,EMMA,Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
48406,L296549,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,"That's who you are too, Emma."
48407,L296547,u1422,m95,EMMA,I don't know.
48408,L296546,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Who?
48409,L296545,u1422,m95,EMMA,Humans.
48410,L296544,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,What's inside?
48411,L296543,u1422,m95,EMMA,Yes.

48413,L296541,u1422,m95,EMMA,I don't know.
48414,L296540,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Have you always had it?
48415,L296539,u1422,m95,EMMA,Mine.
48416,L296535,u1422,m95,EMMA,"I know it.  What do you want, Robert?"
48417,L296534,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,We don't know that --
48418,L296533,u1422,m95,EMMA,Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
48419,L296531,u1422,m95,EMMA,You know what I mean.
48420,L296530,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,What do you mean?
48421,L296529,u1422,m95,EMMA,What do you want?
48422,L296528,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
48423,L296527,u1422,m95,EMMA,You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
48424,L296526,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,I only protect myself -- !
48425,L296525,u1422,m95,EMMA,You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
48426,L296524,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,What choice did I have -- ?!
48427,L296522,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,You're not them.
48428,L296521,u1422,m95,EMMA,Why don't you start with me?
48429,L296520,u1422,m95,EMMA,You want to kill them.
48430,L296519,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Yes.
48431,L296518,u1422,m95,EMMA,You want to find them.
48432,L296516,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Where you lived with them.
48433,L296515,u1422,m95,EMMA,What?
48434,L296514,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Do you remember where it is?
48435,L296513,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Yes.
48436,L296512,u1422,m95,EMMA,"Was this -- ""beautiful?""  Before?"
48437,L296511,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,My wife.
48438,L296510,u1422,m95,EMMA,Who is this?
48439,L296509,u1422,m95,EMMA,"Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive."
48440,L296508,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,"When you're here, in the city, where do you live?"
48441,L296507,u1422,m95,EMMA,We move.  Place to place.
48442,L296506,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Yes.
48443,L296505,u1422,m95,EMMA,With them?
48444,L296504,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,What about... now?
48445,L296503,u1422,m95,EMMA,It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
48446,L296502,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Do you remember where you lived?
48447,L296501,u1422,m95,EMMA,It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
48448,L296500,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,How much do you remember?
48449,L296498,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Do you want to go on?
48450,L296497,u1422,m95,EMMA,Yes.
48451,L296496,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Are you all right?
48452,L296492,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,"Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --"
48453,L296491,u1422,m95,EMMA,It is not arguing to speak the truth.
48454,L296489,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,My name is Robert.
48455,L296488,u1422,m95,EMMA,"That is not now, human!"
48456,L296487,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,You lived like this once.
48457,L296486,u1422,m95,EMMA,I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
48458,L296484,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,No.
48459,L296483,u1422,m95,EMMA,You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
48460,L296451,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Stay alive.
48461,L296450,u1423,m95,FRENCH VOICE,That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
48462,L296449,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
48463,L296448,u1423,m95,FRENCH VOICE,"Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?"
48464,L296447,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
48465,L296446,u1423,m95,FRENCH VOICE,That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
48466,L296445,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
48467,L296444,u1423,m95,FRENCH VOICE,Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
48468,L296592,u1426,m95,VIRGINIA,What?
48469,L296591,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Virginia...?
48470,L296590,u1426,m95,VIRGINIA,"The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --"
48471,L296588,u1426,m95,VIRGINIA,"Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway."
48472,L296587,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
48473,L296586,u1426,m95,VIRGINIA,"Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done."
48474,L296585,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,I surrender --
48475,L296584,u1426,m95,VIRGINIA,"Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?"
48476,L296583,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,You and that damned garden.
48477,L296455,u1426,m95,VIRGINIA,"It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing."
48478,L296454,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Yes.
48479,L296453,u1426,m95,VIRGINIA,I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
48480,L296413,u1425,m95,OLD MAN,Round back.
48481,L296412,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Bathroom?
48482,L296411,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,I guess you could say that.
48483,L296410,u1425,m95,OLD MAN,You built things.
48484,L296409,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
48485,L296408,u1425,m95,OLD MAN,"So, what do you do?"
48486,L296407,u1425,m95,OLD MAN,You got that right.
48487,L296406,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Hell of a night.
48488,L296405,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,That's fine.
48489,L296404,u1425,m95,OLD MAN,Only got one kind.
48490,L296403,u1424,m95,NEVILLE,Please.
48491,L296402,u1425,m95,OLD MAN,Need some gas?
48492,L307676,u1427,m96,DAD,"Better now, son?"
48493,L307675,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I was so scared.
48494,L307674,u1427,m96,DAD,"I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon."
48495,L307670,u1427,m96,DAD,"It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ..."
48496,L307669,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"It was so real, Dad."
48497,L307668,u1427,m96,DAD,"That's a doozy of a dream, son."
48498,L307667,u1429,m96,JIMMY,... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
48499,L307664,u1429,m96,JIMMY,First lemme look at your necks.
48500,L307663,u1427,m96,DAD,"What, Jim, what?"
48501,L307662,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I had an awful dream.
48502,L307298,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Was there anything over the hill?
48503,L307297,u1427,m96,DAD,I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
48504,L307294,u1427,m96,DAD,Sure ... fine.
48505,L307293,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"Are you all right, Dad?"
48506,L307288,u1427,m96,DAD,I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
48507,L307287,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"I don't know, Dad.  But it was big."
48508,L307286,u1427,m96,DAD,Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
48509,L307285,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin."
48510,L307284,u1427,m96,DAD,What did it look like?
48511,L307283,u1429,m96,JIMMY,It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
48512,L307282,u1429,m96,JIMMY,You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
48513,L307281,u1427,m96,DAD,Jim -- what's wrong?!
48514,L307277,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Okay.
48515,L307276,u1427,m96,DAD,"Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day."
48516,L307271,u1427,m96,DAD,"That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky."
48517,L307270,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"Which one's that?  The dull, red one."
48518,L307268,u1427,m96,DAD,And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
48519,L307267,u1429,m96,JIMMY,... and Rigel.
48520,L307266,u1429,m96,JIMMY,There's Cassius ...
48521,L307265,u1427,m96,DAD,This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
48522,L307264,u1429,m96,JIMMY,There are more this year than last.
48523,L307244,u1427,m96,DAD,Because the sky is so clear out here.
48524,L307243,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"Why, Dad?"
48525,L307242,u1427,m96,DAD,It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
48526,L307241,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"A meteorite, Dad, look!"
48527,L307236,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
48528,L307235,u1427,m96,DAD,It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
48529,L307234,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
48530,L307233,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"Let's check it out, Dad."
48531,L307232,u1427,m96,DAD,"If we want it, it is."
48532,L307231,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Is the hill ours too?
48533,L307230,u1427,m96,DAD,This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
48534,L307229,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Wow.  Look at the mountains.
48535,L307221,u1427,m96,DAD,That's the Air Force Base.
48536,L307220,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"What's that, Dad?"
48537,L307218,u1427,m96,DAD,"You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son."
48538,L307217,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
48539,L307216,u1427,m96,DAD,"I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country."
48540,L307215,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Do we have to?
48541,L307214,u1427,m96,DAD,"We're going to be moving, son."
48542,L307213,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Yes.
48543,L307212,u1427,m96,DAD,Son ... are you awake?
48544,L307678,u1431,m96,MOM,Good night.
48545,L307677,u1427,m96,DAD,"Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow."
48546,L307384,u1431,m96,MOM,It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
48547,L307383,u1427,m96,DAD,"What's wrong, Ellen?"
48548,L307377,u1431,m96,MOM,"George, you're acting very strangely."
48549,L307376,u1427,m96,DAD,"You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner."
48550,L307374,u1431,m96,MOM,Yes -- but ...
48551,L307373,u1427,m96,DAD,I'm home now.
48552,L307371,u1431,m96,MOM,You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
48553,L307370,u1427,m96,DAD,I left it at work.
48554,L307369,u1431,m96,MOM,Where's your car?
48555,L307368,u1427,m96,DAD,That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
48556,L307367,u1431,m96,MOM,What happened to you?  Who was that?
48557,L307313,u1431,m96,MOM,I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
48558,L307312,u1427,m96,DAD,"It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong."
48559,L307308,u1431,m96,MOM,"You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run."
48560,L307307,u1427,m96,DAD,I'll take you to school.
48561,L307306,u1431,m96,MOM,"I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late."
48562,L307451,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Why, yes.  Why?"
48563,L307450,u1427,m96,DAD,Is that all he said?
48564,L307449,u1430,m96,LINDA,"He was upset with moving, I believe."
48565,L307448,u1427,m96,DAD,What did he talk to you about?
48566,L307447,u1430,m96,LINDA,"I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone."
48567,L307446,u1427,m96,DAD,"What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?"
48568,L307437,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Yes, Mr. Gardner."
48569,L307436,u1427,m96,DAD,We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
48570,L307435,u1430,m96,LINDA,Of course.
48571,L307434,u1428,m96,DAD'S VOICE,"I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive."
48572,L307433,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter."
48573,L307432,u1428,m96,DAD'S VOICE,"You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?"
48574,L307431,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Mr. Gardner, I --"
48575,L307430,u1428,m96,DAD'S VOICE,I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
48576,L307429,u1430,m96,LINDA,Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
48577,L307428,u1428,m96,DAD'S VOICE,About what?
48578,L307427,u1430,m96,LINDA,We were having a little talk.
48579,L307426,u1428,m96,DAD'S VOICE,May I ask why?
48580,L307425,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner."
48581,L307424,u1428,m96,DAD'S VOICE,"I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office."
48582,L307423,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking."
48583,L307534,u1429,m96,JIMMY,They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
48584,L307533,u1430,m96,LINDA,You're looking for life?
48585,L307506,u1430,m96,LINDA,Let's try.
48586,L307505,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something."
48587,L307504,u1430,m96,LINDA,We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
48588,L307503,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
48589,L307502,u1430,m96,LINDA,Don't go in.
48590,L307500,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore."
48591,L307499,u1429,m96,JIMMY,But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
48592,L307498,u1430,m96,LINDA,I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
48593,L307497,u1429,m96,JIMMY,What is it?
48594,L307491,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I know a way.
48595,L307490,u1430,m96,LINDA,Damn.
48596,L307489,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Hide the car.
48597,L307488,u1430,m96,LINDA,No one comes here after dark.
48598,L307486,u1430,m96,LINDA,All their lines were busy.
48599,L307485,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Did you call the State Police?
48600,L307482,u1430,m96,LINDA,The State Police.
48601,L307481,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Who are you calling?
48602,L307480,u1430,m96,LINDA,Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
48603,L307473,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
48604,L307472,u1430,m96,LINDA,Does it look to you like anything landed here?
48605,L307469,u1430,m96,LINDA,"We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?"
48606,L307468,u1429,m96,JIMMY,They'll get us.
48607,L307467,u1430,m96,LINDA,Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
48608,L307466,u1429,m96,JIMMY,No.
48609,L307465,u1430,m96,LINDA,"But it's not, Jimmy."
48610,L307464,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I swear it was here.
48611,L307462,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"No, but it was here."
48612,L307461,u1430,m96,LINDA,I don't see anything.
48613,L307460,u1429,m96,JIMMY,This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
48614,L307457,u1430,m96,LINDA,"If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind."
48615,L307456,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"Behind my house, up on the ridge."
48616,L307455,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Where, Jimmy?"
48617,L307454,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
48618,L307453,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!"
48619,L307442,u1430,m96,LINDA,"This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen."
48620,L307441,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Yes.  I can even read star maps.
48621,L307440,u1430,m96,LINDA,Do you know how to follow a map?
48622,L307414,u1429,m96,JIMMY,'Cause he wouldn't lie.
48623,L307413,u1430,m96,LINDA,Why?
48624,L307412,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I'd believe him.
48625,L307411,u1430,m96,LINDA,What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
48626,L307410,u1429,m96,JIMMY,She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
48627,L307409,u1430,m96,LINDA,How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
48628,L307408,u1430,m96,LINDA,"A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too."
48629,L307407,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Yes.
48630,L307406,u1430,m96,LINDA,"That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?"
48631,L307201,u1430,m96,LINDA,Can you tell me about that?
48632,L307200,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
48633,L307199,u1430,m96,LINDA,Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
48634,L307198,u1429,m96,JIMMY,No.
48635,L307197,u1430,m96,LINDA,This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
48636,L307673,u1431,m96,MOM,"Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed."
48637,L307672,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"What kind, Mom?"
48638,L307671,u1431,m96,MOM,It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
48639,L307396,u1431,m96,MOM,"I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you."
48640,L307395,u1429,m96,JIMMY,I have school.
48641,L307394,u1431,m96,MOM,This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
48642,L307393,u1429,m96,JIMMY,When?
48643,L307380,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please."
48644,L307379,u1431,m96,MOM,What?
48645,L307378,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
48646,L307344,u1429,m96,JIMMY,The back door was open.
48647,L307343,u1431,m96,MOM,Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
48648,L307304,u1429,m96,JIMMY,What? -- I...
48649,L307303,u1431,m96,MOM,Your father asked you a question.
48650,L307296,u1429,m96,JIMMY,What happened to your other slipper?
48651,L307295,u1431,m96,MOM,"George, where have you been?"
48652,L307290,u1429,m96,JIMMY,"No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane."
48653,L307289,u1431,m96,MOM,What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
48654,L307274,u1431,m96,MOM,"I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too."
48655,L307273,u1429,m96,JIMMY,Mom -- this is the best show all year.
48656,L307272,u1431,m96,MOM,"Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed."
48657,L307422,u1430,m96,LINDA,All right.  I'll be right back.
48658,L307421,u1432,m96,PRINCIPAL,Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
48659,L307420,u1430,m96,LINDA,"Why, yes."
48660,L307419,u1432,m96,PRINCIPAL,"Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?"
48661,L307184,u1432,m96,PRINCIPAL,They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
48662,L307183,u1430,m96,LINDA,What's his family background?
48663,L307182,u1432,m96,PRINCIPAL,Oh?
48664,L307181,u1430,m96,LINDA,His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
48665,L307180,u1432,m96,PRINCIPAL,"Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?"
48666,L307179,u1430,m96,LINDA,What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
48667,L299148,u1446,m97,PHILIP,"If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together."
48668,L299147,u1433,m97,ALICIA,This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
48669,L298768,u1446,m97,PHILIP,Cool.
48670,L298767,u1433,m97,ALICIA,"We're going with you. I mean, we're going too."
48671,L298766,u1446,m97,PHILIP,I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
48672,L298765,u1433,m97,ALICIA,It's really nice of you to help us.
48673,L298764,u1446,m97,PHILIP,Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
48674,L299185,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,You bet it did.
48675,L299184,u1435,m97,DAVID,Did it work?
48676,L299183,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,Are you all right?
48677,L299063,u1435,m97,DAVID,"If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?"
48678,L299062,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,"With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?"
48679,L299059,u1435,m97,DAVID,We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
48680,L299058,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
48681,L298937,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
48682,L298936,u1435,m97,DAVID,Better be. You left me for him.
48683,L298935,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,He's a good man.
48684,L298934,u1435,m97,DAVID,You still believe in him.
48685,L298932,u1435,m97,DAVID,A toast to the end of the world.
48686,L298931,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,I take it you've heard.
48687,L298930,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Just my luck, no ice."
48688,L298781,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,"David, don't..."
48689,L298780,u1435,m97,DAVID,You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
48690,L298647,u1435,m97,DAVID,He's not going to listen to me.
48691,L298646,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
48692,L298645,u1435,m97,DAVID,I want you to leave with us. Right now.
48693,L298644,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,What do you want me to do?
48694,L298643,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds."
48695,L298642,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
48696,L298625,u1435,m97,DAVID,Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
48697,L298624,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,David? How'd you get this number?
48698,L298623,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Connie, don't hang up."
48699,L298622,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,What?
48700,L298522,u1435,m97,DAVID,It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
48701,L298521,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,You're being paranoid.
48702,L298520,u1435,m97,DAVID,I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
48703,L298519,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,"In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here."
48704,L298518,u1435,m97,DAVID,You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
48705,L298517,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
48706,L298516,u1435,m97,DAVID,You have to leave the White House.
48707,L298515,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,What do you want?
48708,L298723,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad."
48709,L298722,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,Love was never our problem.
48710,L298721,u1442,m97,MOISHE,All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
48711,L298720,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,Spunky. He told you about that?
48712,L298719,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"Think nothing of it, Spanky."
48713,L298718,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,"He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two."
48714,L298665,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
48715,L298664,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President."
48716,L298653,u1442,m97,MOISHE,Punched the President? Oh my god.
48717,L298652,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,"David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't."
48718,L298739,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Then get them out of there.
48719,L298738,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,We're losing them.
48720,L298703,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?"
48721,L298702,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,You saved a lot of lives.
48722,L298662,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,I'll bet.
48723,L298661,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
48724,L298660,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,I don't know how you put up with him.
48725,L298439,u1434,m97,CONSTANCE,More than likely.
48726,L298438,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
48727,L298511,u1435,m97,DAVID,Checkmate.
48728,L298510,u1440,m97,MARTY,Then what?
48729,L298507,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike."
48730,L298506,u1440,m97,MARTY,A countdown to what?
48731,L298505,u1435,m97,DAVID,That signal. It's a countdown.
48732,L298504,u1440,m97,MARTY,Not really...
48733,L298503,u1435,m97,DAVID,Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
48734,L298502,u1440,m97,MARTY,"Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?"
48735,L298500,u1435,m97,DAVID,Just do it!
48736,L298499,u1440,m97,MARTY,What happened?
48737,L298498,u1435,m97,DAVID,Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
48738,L298456,u1440,m97,MARTY,Haven't you been watching?
48739,L298455,u1435,m97,DAVID,What're you talking about?
48740,L298454,u1440,m97,MARTY,Can you believe this?
48741,L298453,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?"
48742,L298452,u1440,m97,MARTY,"Huh? Oh, good, good."
48743,L298451,u1435,m97,DAVID,I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
48744,L298404,u1440,m97,MARTY,...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
48745,L298403,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely..."
48746,L298402,u1440,m97,MARTY,That's the good news?
48747,L298401,u1435,m97,DAVID,No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
48748,L298400,u1440,m97,MARTY,And the good news is you won't charge me.
48749,L298399,u1435,m97,DAVID,You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
48750,L298398,u1440,m97,MARTY,What's the bad news?
48751,L298397,u1435,m97,DAVID,There's good news and bad news.
48752,L298354,u1440,m97,MARTY,We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
48753,L298353,u1435,m97,DAVID,Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
48754,L298352,u1440,m97,MARTY,"Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?"
48755,L298351,u1435,m97,DAVID,Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
48756,L298350,u1440,m97,MARTY,So sue me.
48757,L298349,u1435,m97,DAVID,What the hell is this?
48758,L298347,u1440,m97,MARTY,"Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on."
48759,L298346,u1435,m97,DAVID,It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
48760,L298345,u1440,m97,MARTY,What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
48761,L299088,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son."
48762,L299087,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Thanks, Pops."
48763,L298982,u1435,m97,DAVID,A cold? Of course.
48764,L298981,u1442,m97,MOISHE,What'd I say?
48765,L298980,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Pops, you're a genius!"
48766,L298978,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"David, you're drunk."
48767,L298977,u1435,m97,DAVID,"We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore."
48768,L298976,u1442,m97,MOISHE,This I can see.
48769,L298975,u1435,m97,DAVID,I'm making a mess.
48770,L298974,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"David, David! What the hell are you doing!?"
48771,L298791,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!"
48772,L298790,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Dad, please..."
48773,L298715,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Moishe, please, don't talk."
48774,L298714,u1442,m97,MOISHE,It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
48775,L298651,u1435,m97,DAVID,He wasn't the President then.
48776,L298650,u1442,m97,MOISHE,You punched the President in the face?
48777,L298649,u1435,m97,DAVID,Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
48778,L298648,u1442,m97,MOISHE,Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
48779,L298619,u1442,m97,MOISHE,You can do that?
48780,L298618,u1435,m97,DAVID,Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
48781,L298617,u1442,m97,MOISHE,It's perfect the line is busy?
48782,L298616,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Perfect, she's using it."
48783,L298603,u1435,m97,DAVID,She didn't take my name when we were married.
48784,L298602,u1442,m97,MOISHE,You try Martin?
48785,L298601,u1435,m97,DAVID,College nickname.
48786,L298600,u1442,m97,MOISHE,Spunky?
48787,L298599,u1435,m97,DAVID,"I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook..."
48788,L298598,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"Not listed, huh?"
48789,L298582,u1435,m97,DAVID,"She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname..."
48790,L298581,u1442,m97,MOISHE,You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
48791,L298580,u1435,m97,DAVID,"This, pops, is every phone book in America."
48792,L298579,u1442,m97,MOISHE,What the hell is that?
48793,L298555,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you."
48794,L298554,u1435,m97,DAVID,Dad...
48795,L298553,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?"
48796,L298552,u1435,m97,DAVID,They don't know this.
48797,L298551,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything."
48798,L298550,u1435,m97,DAVID,Can't this thing go any faster?
48799,L298549,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell."
48800,L298529,u1435,m97,DAVID,That's okay. You're driving.
48801,L298528,u1442,m97,MOISHE,You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
48802,L298527,u1435,m97,DAVID,You still got the Olds?
48803,L298526,u1442,m97,MOISHE,The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
48804,L298525,u1435,m97,DAVID,Pops!
48805,L298340,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy."
48806,L298339,u1435,m97,DAVID,Three years.
48807,L298338,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers."
48808,L298337,u1435,m97,DAVID,"Dad, don't start."
48809,L298336,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but..."
48810,L298335,u1442,m97,MOISHE,You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
48811,L298334,u1435,m97,DAVID,You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
48812,L298332,u1442,m97,MOISHE,So think already.
48813,L298331,u1435,m97,DAVID,I'm thinking.
48814,L298330,u1442,m97,MOISHE,"What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there."
48815,L299177,u1450,m97,STEVE,I don't hear no fat lady.
48816,L299176,u1435,m97,DAVID,Doesn't matter. Game's over.
48817,L299175,u1450,m97,STEVE,We're loose!
48818,L299171,u1435,m97,DAVID,You as well.
48819,L299170,u1450,m97,STEVE,Nice meeting you.
48820,L299142,u1435,m97,DAVID,It's not me. They're overriding the system.
48821,L299141,u1450,m97,STEVE,What're you doing?
48822,L299140,u1450,m97,STEVE,I can't shake her free.
48823,L299139,u1435,m97,DAVID,Get us out of here!
48824,L299118,u1450,m97,STEVE,Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
48825,L299117,u1435,m97,DAVID,Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
48826,L299100,u1450,m97,STEVE,Just getting a feel for her.
48827,L299099,u1435,m97,DAVID,What the hell are you doing?
48828,L299095,u1450,m97,STEVE,Great.
48829,L299094,u1435,m97,DAVID,I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
48830,L299057,u1435,m97,DAVID,We'll meet you there.
48831,L299056,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Oh shit, we're late."
48832,L299055,u1435,m97,DAVID,I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
48833,L299113,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Roger.
48834,L299112,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
48835,L299104,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
48836,L299103,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Where's it headed?
48837,L299102,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course."
48838,L299101,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"Grey, you read me?"
48839,L299084,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong."
48840,L299083,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?"
48841,L299041,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Then find them.
48842,L299040,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air."
48843,L299039,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"But what, General?"
48844,L299038,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,We've been collecting planes from all over but...
48845,L299037,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,And our troops here?
48846,L299036,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready."
48847,L299035,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,Better than we thought.
48848,L299034,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,How're we doing?
48849,L299020,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"Yes, Sir."
48850,L299019,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
48851,L298868,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,We're being exterminated.
48852,L298867,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours."
48853,L298866,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,And our forces?
48854,L298864,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis."
48855,L298863,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?"
48856,L298709,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,ETA with target; four minutes.
48857,L298708,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Where are they?
48858,L298705,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
48859,L298704,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Any news on my wife?
48860,L298686,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,She should be shortly.
48861,L298685,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Is my wife in the air?
48862,L298675,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
48863,L298674,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,But Mr. President...
48864,L298673,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can."
48865,L298449,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Then God help us.
48866,L298448,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?"
48867,L298447,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,I had a feeling you would.
48868,L298446,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side."
48869,L299009,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,"Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate."
48870,L299008,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,With their shields down it might be possible.
48871,L299005,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,How long would their shields be down?
48872,L299004,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,This is ridiculous.
48873,L298862,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!"
48874,L298861,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,It had been deemed classified.
48875,L298860,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
48876,L298779,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,"Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!"
48877,L298778,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs..."
48878,L298777,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,That's impossible...
48879,L298563,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
48880,L298562,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
48881,L298561,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far."
48882,L298437,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately."
48883,L298436,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
48884,L298383,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,"That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki."
48885,L298382,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
48886,L298303,u1449,m97,SECOND OFFICER,"It's... slowing down, Sir."
48887,L298302,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,It's doing what?
48888,L298301,u1449,m97,SECOND OFFICER,"Well, er... it's slowing down."
48889,L298300,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,How do you know?
48890,L298299,u1449,m97,SECOND OFFICER,No Sir. Definitely not.
48891,L298298,u1436,m97,GENERAL GREY,A meteor?
48892,L299182,u1450,m97,STEVE,Butt-munch.
48893,L299181,u1437,m97,JASMINE,Dick-weed.
48894,L299180,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Yeah, but what an entrance!"
48895,L299179,u1437,m97,JASMINE,You scared the hell out of me.
48896,L299075,u1450,m97,STEVE,I should have done this a long long time ago.
48897,L299074,u1437,m97,JASMINE,Sorry for what?
48898,L299073,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry."
48899,L299072,u1437,m97,JASMINE,"I know, you like to make a big entrance."
48900,L299071,u1450,m97,STEVE,You know me...
48901,L299070,u1437,m97,JASMINE,You're late.
48902,L298959,u1450,m97,STEVE,You know how I like to make a big entrance.
48903,L298958,u1437,m97,JASMINE,You're late.
48904,L298546,u1450,m97,STEVE,Butt-munch.
48905,L298545,u1437,m97,JASMINE,Dick-weed!
48906,L298544,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Yes, I am."
48907,L298543,u1437,m97,JASMINE,"You know, you're not as charming as you think you are."
48908,L298542,u1450,m97,STEVE,Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
48909,L298541,u1437,m97,JASMINE,Really? You don't mind?
48910,L298540,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base."
48911,L298539,u1437,m97,JASMINE,Be careful.
48912,L298538,u1450,m97,STEVE,What?
48913,L298537,u1437,m97,JASMINE,Wait. I have to tell you something.
48914,L298533,u1450,m97,STEVE,They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
48915,L298532,u1437,m97,JASMINE,You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
48916,L298531,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away."
48917,L298530,u1437,m97,JASMINE,You can't go. Call them back.
48918,L298487,u1450,m97,STEVE,He's doing a good job.
48919,L298486,u1437,m97,JASMINE,He's trying to impress you.
48920,L298894,u1437,m97,JASMINE,Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
48921,L298893,u1439,m97,MARGARET,I thought you didn't recognize me.
48922,L298892,u1437,m97,JASMINE,"Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady."
48923,L298891,u1437,m97,JASMINE,"Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore."
48924,L298890,u1439,m97,MARGARET,And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
48925,L298889,u1437,m97,JASMINE,"Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it."
48926,L298888,u1439,m97,MARGARET,Oh. Sorry.
48927,L298887,u1437,m97,JASMINE,No. Exotic.
48928,L298886,u1439,m97,MARGARET,Really? Ballet?
48929,L298885,u1437,m97,JASMINE,I'm a dancer.
48930,L298884,u1439,m97,MARGARET,"So, what do you do for a living?"
48931,L298883,u1437,m97,JASMINE,"He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though."
48932,L298882,u1439,m97,MARGARET,Was his father stationed here?
48933,L298881,u1437,m97,JASMINE,He's my angel.
48934,L298880,u1439,m97,MARGARET,Your son.
48935,L298746,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Jimmy, stay with me."
48936,L298745,u1438,m97,JIMMY,Stevie... I can't...
48937,L298744,u1450,m97,STEVE,So push it!
48938,L298743,u1438,m97,JIMMY,We're already over Mach 2!
48939,L298742,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining."
48940,L298732,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Command, Eagle One. Switching to ""sidewinders."" We're moving in."
48941,L298731,u1438,m97,JIMMY,I didn't even see them fire!
48942,L298730,u1450,m97,STEVE,Damn it!
48943,L298725,u1438,m97,JIMMY,"Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened."
48944,L298724,u1450,m97,STEVE,I shouldn't have left her.
48945,L298713,u1438,m97,JIMMY,I hear you.
48946,L298712,u1450,m97,STEVE,"Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings."
48947,L298711,u1438,m97,JIMMY,That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
48948,L298613,u1450,m97,STEVE,I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
48949,L298612,u1438,m97,JIMMY,Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
48950,L298611,u1450,m97,STEVE,How to kiss ass.
48951,L298610,u1438,m97,JIMMY,I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
48952,L298696,u1451,m97,TROY,I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
48953,L298695,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,But I gave you some this morning.
48954,L298571,u1451,m97,TROY,That'd be cool!
48955,L298570,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
48956,L298569,u1451,m97,TROY,"He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?"
48957,L298360,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,"Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine."
48958,L298359,u1451,m97,TROY,I don't need it.
48959,L298358,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,"You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine."
48960,L298357,u1451,m97,TROY,It's all fuzzy.
48961,L298356,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,Stop it.
48962,L299043,u1448,m97,RUSSELL,Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
48963,L299042,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,How' he doing?
48964,L298763,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,"There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them."
48965,L298762,u1448,m97,RUSSELL,We should leave too.
48966,L298761,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,"I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way."
48967,L298634,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
48968,L298633,u1448,m97,RUSSELL,Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
48969,L298631,u1448,m97,RUSSELL,You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
48970,L298630,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,"We're leaving, don't try and stop us."
48971,L298629,u1448,m97,RUSSELL,Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
48972,L298628,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,They let you out?
48973,L298410,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,"Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?"
48974,L298409,u1448,m97,RUSSELL,You sure?
48975,L298408,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,"It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town."
48976,L298407,u1448,m97,RUSSELL,I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
48977,L298406,u1441,m97,MIGUEL,Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
48978,L298957,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,I said call them back.
48979,L298956,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
48980,L298955,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Call them back.
48981,L298948,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Deploy.
48982,L298947,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,Mr. President?
48983,L298815,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,"Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability."
48984,L298814,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
48985,L298774,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,"If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend."
48986,L298773,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Above American soil?
48987,L298772,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,"I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got."
48988,L298677,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,We're leaving.
48989,L298676,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,What the hell's going on?
48990,L298445,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover."
48991,L298444,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,"But, Mr. President..."
48992,L298443,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives."
48993,L298442,u1443,m97,NIMZIKI,We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
48994,L298441,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,I'm not leaving.
48995,L298835,u1444,m97,OKUN,"These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced."
48996,L298834,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Can they be killed?
48997,L298829,u1444,m97,OKUN,"Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?"
48998,L298828,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
48999,L298827,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,"People are dying out there. I don't think ""exciting"" is the word I'd choose to describe it!"
49000,L298826,u1444,m97,OKUN,"See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!"
49001,L298821,u1444,m97,OKUN,"Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me."
49002,L298820,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Yes.
49003,L298819,u1444,m97,OKUN,"Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know."
49004,L298921,u1445,m97,OKUN/ALIEN,Die.
49005,L298920,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,What do you want us to do?
49006,L298919,u1445,m97,OKUN/ALIEN,Peace? No peace.
49007,L298918,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
49008,L298917,u1445,m97,OKUN/ALIEN,Many worlds...
49009,L298916,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,And before here?
49010,L298915,u1445,m97,OKUN/ALIEN,Here... now.
49011,L298914,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
49012,L298913,u1445,m97,OKUN/ALIEN,"Air... water... your ""sun."""
49013,L298912,u1447,m97,PRESIDENT,Why did you people come here?
49014,L300004,u1460,m98,SALLAH,The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
49015,L300003,u1452,m98,BRODY,"May we go home now, please?"
49016,L299639,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Did you say...? Uh, uh..."
49017,L299638,u1460,m98,SALLAH,Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
49018,L299637,u1452,m98,BRODY,Yes.
49019,L299635,u1460,m98,SALLAH,"Papers, sir. Got it here."
49020,L299634,u1452,m98,BRODY,Yes.
49021,L299630,u1460,m98,SALLAH,There is no museum in Iskenderun.
49022,L299629,u1452,m98,BRODY,My reputation precedes me.
49023,L299627,u1460,m98,SALLAH,And I am his.
49024,L299626,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Oh, what?... your servant, sir."
49025,L299623,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh..."
49026,L299622,u1460,m98,SALLAH,"Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?"
49027,L299621,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?"
49028,L299620,u1460,m98,SALLAH,You are on your own?
49029,L299619,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour."
49030,L299618,u1460,m98,SALLAH,"Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?"
49031,L299617,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Oh, Sallah! What a relief!"
49032,L299952,u1457,m98,INDY,"It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God."
49033,L299951,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!"
49034,L299475,u1457,m98,INDY,I'm going after Dad.
49035,L299474,u1452,m98,BRODY,What about you?
49036,L299473,u1457,m98,INDY,"Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun."
49037,L299472,u1452,m98,BRODY,Yes. Now we know.
49038,L299471,u1457,m98,INDY,Alexandretta. Now we know.
49039,L299470,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city."
49040,L299468,u1452,m98,BRODY,Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
49041,L299467,u1457,m98,INDY,"The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. ""Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.""  But where exactly?"
49042,L299465,u1452,m98,BRODY,"It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. ""Alexandretta?"" Hmmm..."
49043,L299464,u1457,m98,INDY,How's the head?
49044,L299385,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean."
49045,L299384,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad was onto something here!
49046,L299383,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!"
49047,L299381,u1452,m98,BRODY,Where?
49048,L299380,u1457,m98,INDY,Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
49049,L299376,u1452,m98,BRODY,It looks like a converted church.
49050,L299375,u1457,m98,INDY,That doesn't look much like a library.
49051,L299350,u1457,m98,INDY,I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
49052,L299349,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?"
49053,L299348,u1457,m98,INDY,"Ah, Venice..."
49054,L299341,u1452,m98,BRODY,I'll tell him we'll take two.
49055,L299340,u1457,m98,INDY,"Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now."
49056,L299339,u1452,m98,BRODY,"But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith."
49057,L299338,u1452,m98,BRODY,The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
49058,L299337,u1457,m98,INDY,Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
49059,L299336,u1457,m98,INDY,"Do you believe, Marcus?"
49060,L299335,u1452,m98,BRODY,I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
49061,L299334,u1457,m98,INDY,It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
49062,L299333,u1452,m98,BRODY,What is it?
49063,L299332,u1457,m98,INDY,"Venice, Italy!"
49064,L299330,u1452,m98,BRODY,It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
49065,L299329,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad?
49066,L299328,u1457,m98,INDY,"I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!"
49067,L299327,u1452,m98,BRODY,What has the old fool got himself into now?
49068,L299282,u1452,m98,BRODY,Yes. My treat.
49069,L299281,u1457,m98,INDY,Your treat.
49070,L299279,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection."
49071,L299278,u1457,m98,INDY,All my life!
49072,L299277,u1452,m98,BRODY,All your life.
49073,L299276,u1457,m98,INDY,You know how long I've been looking for that?!
49074,L299275,u1452,m98,BRODY,You've got it!
49075,L299274,u1457,m98,INDY,Marcus!  I did it!
49076,L300009,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Got lost in his own museum, huh?"
49077,L300008,u1452,m98,BRODY,Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
49078,L299942,u1456,m98,HENRY,The Name of God...
49079,L299941,u1452,m98,BRODY,"No, Henry. Try not to talk."
49080,L299940,u1456,m98,HENRY,The Word of God...
49081,L299890,u1456,m98,HENRY,It's war.
49082,L299889,u1452,m98,BRODY,Look what you did!
49083,L299888,u1452,m98,BRODY,But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
49084,L299887,u1456,m98,HENRY,What?
49085,L299886,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Henry, the pen --"
49086,L299862,u1456,m98,HENRY,"It's a rescue, old boy. Come on."
49087,L299861,u1452,m98,BRODY,Henry! What are you doing here?!
49088,L299858,u1452,m98,BRODY,Arghhh! Oh!
49089,L299857,u1456,m98,HENRY,Marcus!
49090,L299836,u1452,m98,BRODY,You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
49091,L299835,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind."
49092,L299833,u1452,m98,BRODY,I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
49093,L299832,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?"
49094,L299346,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Oh, well. That's good. Thank you."
49095,L299345,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal."
49096,L299344,u1452,m98,BRODY,Schneider?
49097,L299343,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
49098,L299342,u1452,m98,BRODY,"Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?"
49099,L299511,u1457,m98,INDY,How dare he?!
49100,L299510,u1453,m98,BUTLER,"This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse."
49101,L299509,u1457,m98,INDY,"Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?"
49102,L299508,u1453,m98,BUTLER,Tapestries?
49103,L299507,u1457,m98,INDY,"Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries."
49104,L299506,u1453,m98,BUTLER,Are you expected?
49105,L299935,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,We're through!
49106,L299934,u1457,m98,INDY,I'm through!
49107,L299918,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right."
49108,L299917,u1457,m98,INDY,Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
49109,L299916,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me."
49110,L299915,u1457,m98,INDY,As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
49111,L299914,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?"
49112,L299602,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?"
49113,L299601,u1457,m98,INDY,DONOVAN!
49114,L299322,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
49115,L299321,u1457,m98,INDY,"You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?"
49116,L299320,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail."
49117,L299319,u1457,m98,INDY,Yes?
49118,L299318,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,You could be more right than you know.
49119,L299317,u1457,m98,INDY,That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
49120,L299316,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two ""markers"" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those ""markers."" It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second ""marker"" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away."
49121,L299315,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Not ""supposedly,"" Doctor Jones."
49122,L299314,u1457,m98,INDY,"I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think."
49123,L299313,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Let me tell you another ""bedtime story,"" Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact."
49124,L299312,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway."
49125,L299311,u1457,m98,INDY,"What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing."
49126,L299310,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!"
49127,L299306,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe."
49128,L299305,u1457,m98,INDY,An old man's dream.
49129,L299304,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!"
49130,L299303,u1457,m98,INDY,The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
49131,L299302,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea."
49132,L299301,u1457,m98,INDY,"""Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."""
49133,L299298,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
49134,L299297,u1457,m98,INDY,Where did this come from?
49135,L299296,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,That was our assessment as well.
49136,L299295,u1457,m98,INDY,"Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think."
49137,L299294,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,"Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you."
49138,L299293,u1457,m98,INDY,I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
49139,L299292,u1454,m98,DONOVAN,My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
49140,L299985,u1455,m98,ELSA,I can reach it. I can reach it...
49141,L299984,u1457,m98,INDY,"Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you."
49142,L299982,u1457,m98,INDY,"Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here."
49143,L299981,u1455,m98,ELSA,"It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine."
49144,L299980,u1457,m98,INDY,"Elsa! Elsa, don't move!"
49145,L299912,u1457,m98,INDY,I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
49146,L299911,u1455,m98,ELSA,I never expected to see you again.
49147,L299745,u1455,m98,ELSA,All I have to do is scream.
49148,L299744,u1457,m98,INDY,All I have to do is squeeze.
49149,L299743,u1455,m98,ELSA,You do.
49150,L299742,u1457,m98,INDY,Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
49151,L299741,u1455,m98,ELSA,"Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika."
49152,L299740,u1457,m98,INDY,My father didn't want it incinerated.
49153,L299739,u1455,m98,ELSA,You came back for the book? Why?
49154,L299738,u1457,m98,INDY,Where is it? I want it.
49155,L299737,u1455,m98,ELSA,How did you get here?
49156,L299606,u1457,m98,INDY,So it did.
49157,L299605,u1455,m98,ELSA,This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
49158,L299514,u1455,m98,ELSA,How do you know?
49159,L299513,u1457,m98,INDY,This one. I think he's in here.
49160,L299502,u1457,m98,INDY,Don't know. Think of something.
49161,L299501,u1455,m98,ELSA,What are you going to do?
49162,L299500,u1455,m98,ELSA,I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
49163,L299499,u1457,m98,INDY,What do you know about this place?
49164,L299493,u1455,m98,ELSA,It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
49165,L299492,u1457,m98,INDY,No. You like the way I do things.
49166,L299491,u1455,m98,ELSA,No?
49167,L299490,u1457,m98,INDY,Knock it off. You're not mad.
49168,L299489,u1455,m98,ELSA,"Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere."
49169,L299488,u1457,m98,INDY,At least I let you tag along.
49170,L299486,u1455,m98,ELSA,You had it? You didn't trust me!
49171,L299485,u1457,m98,INDY,Uh-huh.
49172,L299484,u1455,m98,ELSA,The Grail Diary.
49173,L299483,u1457,m98,INDY,This.
49174,L299482,u1455,m98,ELSA,What were they looking for?
49175,L299481,u1457,m98,INDY,"Mine, too."
49176,L299480,u1455,m98,ELSA,My room!
49177,L299442,u1457,m98,INDY,I said don't go between them!
49178,L299441,u1455,m98,ELSA,You said go between them!
49179,L299440,u1457,m98,INDY,I said go around!
49180,L299434,u1455,m98,ELSA,What?
49181,L299433,u1457,m98,INDY,Don't wander off.
49182,L299429,u1457,m98,INDY,He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
49183,L299428,u1455,m98,ELSA,Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
49184,L299426,u1457,m98,INDY,It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
49185,L299425,u1455,m98,ELSA,What's that?
49186,L299422,u1455,m98,ELSA,Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
49187,L299421,u1457,m98,INDY,It must be one of these...
49188,L299413,u1457,m98,INDY,Pretty sure.
49189,L299412,u1455,m98,ELSA,Are you sure?
49190,L299411,u1457,m98,INDY,The Ark of the Covenant.
49191,L299407,u1455,m98,ELSA,The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
49192,L299406,u1457,m98,INDY,Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
49193,L299405,u1455,m98,ELSA,Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
49194,L299402,u1455,m98,ELSA,Lower me down.
49195,L299401,u1457,m98,INDY,"Except he's lost, and I'm not."
49196,L299400,u1455,m98,ELSA,"You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father."
49197,L299399,u1457,m98,INDY,Bingo.
49198,L299387,u1455,m98,ELSA,Find something?
49199,L299386,u1457,m98,INDY,"My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves."
49200,L299369,u1457,m98,INDY,Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
49201,L299368,u1455,m98,ELSA,But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
49202,L299367,u1457,m98,INDY,It would make me very happy.
49203,L299366,u1455,m98,ELSA,"In that case, I permit you."
49204,L299365,u1457,m98,INDY,I usually don't either.
49205,L299364,u1455,m98,ELSA,I usually don't.
49206,L299363,u1457,m98,INDY,Fraulein -- will you permit me?
49207,L299362,u1457,m98,INDY,"Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!"
49208,L299361,u1455,m98,ELSA,The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
49209,L299356,u1455,m98,ELSA,Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
49210,L299355,u1457,m98,INDY,And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
49211,L299353,u1455,m98,ELSA,I knew it was you --
49212,L299352,u1457,m98,INDY,Yes?
49213,L299351,u1455,m98,ELSA,Doctor Jones?
49214,L300012,u1457,m98,INDY,"Yes, sir!  Haaa!"
49215,L300011,u1456,m98,HENRY,"After you, Junior."
49216,L300010,u1457,m98,INDY,Uh-huh.
49217,L300007,u1456,m98,HENRY,Ready.
49218,L300006,u1457,m98,INDY,Ready?
49219,L300002,u1456,m98,HENRY,We named the dog Indiana.
49220,L300001,u1457,m98,INDY,I like Indiana.
49221,L299998,u1457,m98,INDY,Junior?! Dad...
49222,L299997,u1456,m98,HENRY,"What did you find, Junior?"
49223,L299996,u1456,m98,HENRY,Me?... Illumination.
49224,L299995,u1457,m98,INDY,"What did you find, Dad?"
49225,L299994,u1456,m98,HENRY,Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
49226,L299989,u1457,m98,INDY,"I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad."
49227,L299988,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!"
49228,L299945,u1457,m98,INDY,"""J""."
49229,L299944,u1456,m98,HENRY,"But in the Latin alphabet, ""Jehovah"" begins with an ""I""."
49230,L299932,u1457,m98,INDY,The penitent man is humble...
49231,L299931,u1456,m98,HENRY,Penitent. Penitent...
49232,L299930,u1457,m98,INDY,The penitent man is humble before God.

49234,L299928,u1457,m98,INDY,The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
49235,L299927,u1456,m98,HENRY,"""Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."""
49236,L299920,u1456,m98,HENRY,Junior...
49237,L299919,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad?!
49238,L299894,u1457,m98,INDY,"Get out of there, Dad!"
49239,L299893,u1456,m98,HENRY,You call this archaeology?
49240,L299892,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad?
49241,L299849,u1457,m98,INDY,"Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation."
49242,L299848,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Now, who are all these people?"
49243,L299839,u1457,m98,INDY,"Dad, we're well out of range."
49244,L299838,u1456,m98,HENRY,What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
49245,L299810,u1457,m98,INDY,This could be close.
49246,L299809,u1456,m98,HENRY,This is intolerable!
49247,L299808,u1457,m98,INDY,It happens to me all the time.
49248,L299807,u1456,m98,HENRY,It's a new experience for me.
49249,L299806,u1457,m98,INDY,"I know, Dad!"
49250,L299805,u1456,m98,HENRY,Those people are trying to kill us!
49251,L299804,u1457,m98,INDY,Thanks.
49252,L299803,u1456,m98,HENRY,Nice landing.
49253,L299801,u1456,m98,HENRY,"More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us."
49254,L299800,u1457,m98,INDY,"Dad, are we hit?!"
49255,L299798,u1456,m98,HENRY,What happens at eleven o'clock?
49256,L299797,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
49257,L299794,u1457,m98,INDY,Fly... yes. Land... no.
49258,L299793,u1456,m98,HENRY,I didn't know you could fly a plane.
49259,L299789,u1456,m98,HENRY,I don't know. We'll find out.
49260,L299788,u1457,m98,INDY,What does that mean?
49261,L299787,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  ""First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."""
49262,L299786,u1457,m98,INDY,Well... I can't think of anything.
49263,L299784,u1456,m98,HENRY,Very well. I'm here now.
49264,L299783,u1457,m98,INDY,"Dad, how can you?"
49265,L299782,u1456,m98,HENRY,You left just when you were becoming interesting.
49266,L299781,u1457,m98,INDY,What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
49267,L299780,u1456,m98,HENRY,Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
49268,L299779,u1457,m98,INDY,When?
49269,L299778,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Actually, I was a wonderful father."
49270,L299777,u1457,m98,INDY,"A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that."
49271,L299776,u1456,m98,HENRY,And do I detect a rebuke?
49272,L299775,u1457,m98,INDY,We didn't talk. We never talked.
49273,L299774,u1456,m98,HENRY,Hmmm... What did we talk about?
49274,L299773,u1457,m98,INDY,Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
49275,L299772,u1456,m98,HENRY,Ships that pass in the night...
49276,L299771,u1457,m98,INDY,I was the next man.
49277,L299770,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Well, I'm as human as the next man."
49278,L299769,u1457,m98,INDY,"That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!"
49279,L299768,u1456,m98,HENRY,"You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience."
49280,L299752,u1457,m98,INDY,Relax.
49281,L299751,u1456,m98,HENRY,"When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment."
49282,L299749,u1456,m98,HENRY,Good.
49283,L299748,u1457,m98,INDY,I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
49284,L299747,u1456,m98,HENRY,What did you get?
49285,L299734,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her."
49286,L299733,u1457,m98,INDY,This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
49287,L299732,u1456,m98,HENRY,"That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?"
49288,L299731,u1457,m98,INDY,Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
49289,L299730,u1456,m98,HENRY,Marcus would agree with me.
49290,L299729,u1457,m98,INDY,What about Marcus?
49291,L299728,u1456,m98,HENRY,Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
49292,L299727,u1457,m98,INDY,Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
49293,L299726,u1456,m98,HENRY,I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
49294,L299725,u1457,m98,INDY,But what are they? Can't you remember?
49295,L299724,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm."
49296,L299723,u1457,m98,INDY,Booby traps?
49297,L299722,u1456,m98,HENRY,Three devices of such lethal cunning.
49298,L299721,u1457,m98,INDY,What final challenge?
49299,L299720,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge."
49300,L299719,u1457,m98,INDY,All right Dad -- tell me.
49301,L299718,u1456,m98,HENRY,There is more in the Diary than just the map.
49302,L299717,u1457,m98,INDY,"You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map."
49303,L299716,u1456,m98,HENRY,My Diary's in Berlin.
49304,L299715,u1457,m98,INDY,Brody's this way.
49305,L299714,u1456,m98,HENRY,You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
49306,L299713,u1456,m98,HENRY,Stop! Stop!
49307,L299712,u1457,m98,INDY,What?
49308,L299711,u1456,m98,HENRY,Stop!
49309,L299707,u1456,m98,HENRY,What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
49310,L299706,u1457,m98,INDY,"Come on, Dad. Come on!"
49311,L299702,u1456,m98,HENRY,...the solution presents itself.
49312,L299701,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad!
49313,L299695,u1457,m98,INDY,"I'm out, Dad!"
49314,L299694,u1456,m98,HENRY,This is intolerable!
49315,L299687,u1456,m98,HENRY,Oh.
49316,L299686,u1457,m98,INDY,Head for the fireplace!
49317,L299685,u1456,m98,HENRY,What?
49318,L299684,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad!
49319,L299683,u1456,m98,HENRY,What?
49320,L299682,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad!
49321,L299681,u1456,m98,HENRY,What?
49322,L299680,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad!
49323,L299675,u1457,m98,INDY,"All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do."
49324,L299674,u1456,m98,HENRY,And the chair.
49325,L299673,u1457,m98,INDY,What???
49326,L299672,u1456,m98,HENRY,The floor's on fire! See?!
49327,L299671,u1457,m98,INDY,Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
49328,L299670,u1456,m98,HENRY,I ought to tell you something.
49329,L299668,u1457,m98,INDY,Try and burn through the ropes.
49330,L299667,u1456,m98,HENRY,Feels like a cigarette lighter.
49331,L299666,u1457,m98,INDY,My lucky charm.
49332,L299665,u1456,m98,HENRY,What am I looking for?
49333,L299663,u1457,m98,INDY,Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
49334,L299662,u1456,m98,HENRY,You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
49335,L299661,u1457,m98,INDY,Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
49336,L299660,u1456,m98,HENRY,So did I.
49337,L299659,u1457,m98,INDY,Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
49338,L299598,u1456,m98,HENRY,She talks in her sleep.
49339,L299597,u1457,m98,INDY,How did you she was a Nazi?
49340,L299596,u1456,m98,HENRY,Umh?
49341,L299595,u1457,m98,INDY,She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
49342,L299587,u1456,m98,HENRY,Don't worry. He won't.
49343,L299586,u1457,m98,INDY,No! Don't Shoot!
49344,L299571,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??"
49345,L299570,u1457,m98,INDY,I came here to save you.
49346,L299569,u1456,m98,HENRY,Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
49347,L299568,u1457,m98,INDY,Will you take it easy!
49348,L299567,u1456,m98,HENRY,I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
49349,L299566,u1457,m98,INDY,"Look, can we discuss this later?"
49350,L299565,u1456,m98,HENRY,You did!!
49351,L299564,u1457,m98,INDY,"Well, uh..."
49352,L299563,u1456,m98,HENRY,"You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?"
49353,L299554,u1457,m98,INDY,Yeah?
49354,L299553,u1456,m98,HENRY,They want my diary.
49355,L299552,u1457,m98,INDY,"Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?"
49356,L299551,u1456,m98,HENRY,Rats?
49357,L299550,u1457,m98,INDY,"There were rats, Dad."
49358,L299549,u1456,m98,HENRY,If only I could have been with you.
49359,L299548,u1457,m98,INDY,"No, Dad. You did. Forty years."
49360,L299547,u1456,m98,HENRY,...you did it.
49361,L299546,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior..."
49362,L299545,u1457,m98,INDY,"Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy."
49363,L299544,u1456,m98,HENRY,And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
49364,L299543,u1457,m98,INDY,"Well, what was left of him."
49365,L299542,u1456,m98,HENRY,He was actually there? You saw him?
49366,L299541,u1457,m98,INDY,Found it.
49367,L299540,u1456,m98,HENRY,I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
49368,L299539,u1457,m98,INDY,Right.
49369,L299538,u1456,m98,HENRY,Through the library?
49370,L299537,u1457,m98,INDY,I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
49371,L299536,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it."
49372,L299534,u1456,m98,HENRY,Good point.
49373,L299533,u1457,m98,INDY,"Dad, they come in through the doors."
49374,L299532,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them."
49375,L299531,u1457,m98,INDY,"No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here."
49376,L299529,u1456,m98,HENRY,Thank God!
49377,L299528,u1457,m98,INDY,Don't worry -- I'm fine.
49378,L299527,u1456,m98,HENRY,I'll never forgive myself --
49379,L299526,u1457,m98,INDY,"And the head.  You hit me, Dad!"
49380,L299525,u1456,m98,HENRY,"Oh, it breaks the heart."
49381,L299523,u1457,m98,INDY,I came to get you! What do you think?
49382,L299522,u1456,m98,HENRY,But what are you doing here?
49383,L299521,u1457,m98,INDY,"Don't call me that, please."
49384,L299520,u1456,m98,HENRY,It is you Junior!
49385,L299246,u1456,m98,HENRY,Junior!
49386,L299245,u1457,m98,INDY,"No, Dad. You listen to me --"
49387,L299244,u1456,m98,HENRY,Then wait -- count to twenty.
49388,L299243,u1457,m98,INDY,It's important!
49389,L299242,u1456,m98,HENRY,Out!
49390,L299241,u1457,m98,INDY,Dad!
49391,L299961,u1459,m98,KNIGHT,I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
49392,L299960,u1457,m98,INDY,I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
49393,L299959,u1459,m98,KNIGHT,You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
49394,L299958,u1459,m98,KNIGHT,A long time to wait.
49395,L299957,u1457,m98,INDY,That was seven hundred years ago.
49396,L299956,u1459,m98,KNIGHT,The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
49397,L299955,u1457,m98,INDY,Who are you?
49398,L299954,u1459,m98,KNIGHT,"I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me."
49399,L299876,u1460,m98,SALLAH,They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
49400,L299875,u1457,m98,INDY,Where's my father?
49401,L299874,u1460,m98,SALLAH,"Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --"
49402,L299873,u1457,m98,INDY,"Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?"
49403,L299854,u1457,m98,INDY,No camels!
49404,L299853,u1460,m98,SALLAH,"But, Indy --"
49405,L299852,u1457,m98,INDY,I don't need camels.
49406,L299851,u1460,m98,SALLAH,I'll take the camels.
49407,L299850,u1457,m98,INDY,I'm going after those horses.
49408,L299841,u1457,m98,INDY,Come on -- come on!
49409,L299840,u1460,m98,SALLAH,That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
49410,L299829,u1460,m98,SALLAH,"Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them."
49411,L299828,u1457,m98,INDY,"What happened to Marcus, Sallah?"
49412,L299827,u1460,m98,SALLAH,Get that camel out of the way!
49413,L299463,u1458,m98,KAZIM,"In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border."
49414,L299462,u1457,m98,INDY,I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
49415,L299461,u1458,m98,KAZIM,"Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?"
49416,L299459,u1458,m98,KAZIM,The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
49417,L299458,u1457,m98,INDY,And why were you trying to kill me?
49418,L299457,u1458,m98,KAZIM,My name is Kazim.
49419,L299456,u1457,m98,INDY,Who are you?
49420,L299455,u1458,m98,KAZIM,"If you let me go, I will tell you where he is."
49421,L299454,u1457,m98,INDY,All right! Where's my father
49422,L299453,u1458,m98,KAZIM,"No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!"
49423,L299452,u1457,m98,INDY,This is your last chance.
49424,L299451,u1458,m98,KAZIM,My soul is prepared. How's yours?
49425,L299450,u1457,m98,INDY,Then we'll die.
49426,L299449,u1458,m98,KAZIM,"If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die."
49427,L299448,u1457,m98,INDY,"Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!"
49428,L299447,u1458,m98,KAZIM,No.
49429,L299446,u1457,m98,INDY,My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
49430,L299445,u1458,m98,KAZIM,Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
49431,L299444,u1457,m98,INDY,Why are you trying to kill us?
49432,L300572,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,"As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi."
49433,L300571,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain."
49434,L300570,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,"Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot."
49435,L300343,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
49436,L300342,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century."
49437,L300312,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
49438,L300311,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Just a routine inspection tour.
49439,L300310,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the ""natives""."
49440,L300568,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,"Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?"
49441,L300567,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
49442,L300565,u1463,m99,INDIANA,When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
49443,L300564,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Miss Scott panicked?
49444,L300563,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
49445,L300380,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are..."
49446,L300379,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,"Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?"
49447,L300360,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Something magical. A sacred rock.
49448,L300359,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
49449,L300326,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,"No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province."
49450,L300325,u1463,m99,INDIANA,The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
49451,L300324,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,"This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century."
49452,L300323,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
49453,L300322,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,"Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now."
49454,L300321,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You think so?
49455,L300320,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
49456,L300319,u1463,m99,INDIANA,It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
49457,L300318,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Charming.
49458,L300317,u1463,m99,INDIANA,No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
49459,L300316,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Interested in local curios?
49460,L300551,u1468,m99,WILLIE,It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
49461,L300550,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Who?
49462,L300547,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!"
49463,L300546,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,What?
49464,L300545,u1468,m99,WILLIE,No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
49465,L300544,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
49466,L300329,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Finally!
49467,L300328,u1461,m99,CAPT. BLUMBURTT,I believe we're being called to dinner.
49468,L300553,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
49469,L300552,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
49470,L300549,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
49471,L300548,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"Miss Scott, you're not making any sense."
49472,L300315,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman..."
49473,L300314,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
49474,L300313,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?"
49475,L300303,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!"
49476,L300302,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
49477,L300301,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
49478,L300300,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father."
49479,L300299,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"He's not exactly what we call ""a spring chicken""."
49480,L300295,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You should have been there...
49481,L300294,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
49482,L300291,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot."
49483,L300290,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Hard to believe, isn't it...?"
49484,L300594,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!"
49485,L300593,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,You understand what he tells us?
49486,L300588,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Yes, I understand."
49487,L300587,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power."
49488,L300372,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones."
49489,L300371,u1463,m99,INDIANA,That was a misunderstanding.
49490,L300370,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
49491,L300369,u1463,m99,INDIANA,The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
49492,L300368,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist."
49493,L300367,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
49494,L300363,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones..."
49495,L300362,u1463,m99,INDIANA,When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
49496,L300361,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"There, you see, Captain. A rock!"
49497,L300358,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore."
49498,L300357,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host."
49499,L300356,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
49500,L300350,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
49501,L300349,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,Their stories are just fear and folklore.
49502,L300348,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil."
49503,L300347,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,There are no stories anymore.
49504,L300346,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
49505,L300341,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali."
49506,L300340,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?"
49507,L300339,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts."
49508,L300297,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,"I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice."
49509,L300296,u1463,m99,INDIANA,We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
49510,L300289,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
49511,L300288,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones."
49512,L300287,u1462,m99,CHATTAR LAL,I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
49513,L300046,u1464,m99,LAO,At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
49514,L300045,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Now what about the antidote, Lao."
49515,L300040,u1464,m99,LAO,"A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it."
49516,L300039,u1463,m99,INDIANA,What's that?
49517,L300025,u1464,m99,LAO,Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
49518,L300024,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
49519,L300023,u1464,m99,LAO,You have insulted my son.
49520,L300021,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat."
49521,L300020,u1464,m99,LAO,"So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?"
49522,L300018,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I don't like to show off.
49523,L300017,u1464,m99,LAO,"You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones."
49524,L300015,u1464,m99,LAO,Nee chin lie how ma?
49525,L300014,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Lao She.
49526,L300013,u1464,m99,LAO,Dr. Jones.
49527,L300651,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,What?
49528,L300650,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Let up on the brake!
49529,L300649,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Read you loud and clear, Indy!"
49530,L300648,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
49531,L300625,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,Behind you!
49532,L300624,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Come one, what's wrong?"
49533,L300516,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Why?
49534,L300515,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
49535,L300499,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
49536,L300498,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,Why they glow like that?
49537,L300497,u1463,m99,INDIANA,The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
49538,L300441,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"""Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."""
49539,L300440,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"What does it mean, Indy?"
49540,L300422,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie."
49541,L300421,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
49542,L300395,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Yeah, that's what happened..."
49543,L300394,u1463,m99,INDIANA,He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
49544,L300393,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!"
49545,L300392,u1463,m99,INDIANA,No.
49546,L300391,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
49547,L300390,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You don't like him do you?
49548,L300389,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
49549,L300276,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Just a statue.
49550,L300275,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"What you look at, Indy?"
49551,L300273,u1463,m99,INDIANA,That's it. Pankot Palace.
49552,L300272,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Indy, look!"
49553,L300185,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty."
49554,L300184,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"I ride with you, Indy?"
49555,L300159,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story."
49556,L300158,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?"
49557,L300122,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Okay, Shorty."
49558,L300121,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,Indy?
49559,L300081,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --"
49560,L300080,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"You got the tickets, Short Round?"
49561,L300067,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!"
49562,L300066,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Step on it, Short Round!"
49563,L300065,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
49564,L300688,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You're betrayed Shiva.
49565,L300687,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,"No, the stones are mine!"
49566,L300685,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
49567,L300684,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,Give me the stones!
49568,L300679,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,"You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones."
49569,L300678,u1463,m99,INDIANA,That's far enough!
49570,L300532,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,"You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer."
49571,L300531,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
49572,L300530,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
49573,L300529,u1463,m99,INDIANA,That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
49574,L300528,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,"No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs."
49575,L300527,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Two are still missing.
49576,L300526,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,"There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you..."
49577,L300525,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village."
49578,L300524,u1465,m99,MOLA RAM,You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
49579,L300173,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here."
49580,L300172,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
49581,L300166,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
49582,L300165,u1463,m99,INDIANA,But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
49583,L300163,u1463,m99,INDIANA,And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
49584,L300162,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,Long ago -- before my father's father.
49585,L300161,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
49586,L300157,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
49587,L300156,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
49588,L300155,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,It is why Krishna brought you here.
49589,L300152,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
49590,L300151,u1463,m99,INDIANA,What evil?
49591,L300150,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,"The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country."
49592,L300149,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I don't understand. What's happened here?
49593,L300148,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
49594,L300147,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
49595,L300146,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
49596,L300145,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,You will go to palace there.
49597,L300144,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
49598,L300143,u1466,m99,SHAMAN,"On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot."
49599,L300702,u1463,m99,INDIANA,It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
49600,L300701,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
49601,L300700,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond."
49602,L300699,u1468,m99,WILLIE,And they don't even know what it really is.
49603,L300698,u1463,m99,INDIANA,The last Sankara Stone.
49604,L300691,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Not quite.
49605,L300690,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
49606,L300659,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
49607,L300658,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Anymore ideas...?
49608,L300653,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What above the curves?!
49609,L300652,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
49610,L300621,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Go!
49611,L300620,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I can't!
49612,L300616,u1463,m99,INDIANA,There's got to be another way out.
49613,L300615,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What're we going to do?!
49614,L300581,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
49615,L300580,u1463,m99,INDIANA,No... they won't kill me.
49616,L300579,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
49617,L300577,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Yes, they believe you."
49618,L300576,u1468,m99,WILLIE,So now they believe me.
49619,L300575,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Yes.
49620,L300574,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Indy? Did you talk to them?
49621,L300562,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
49622,L300561,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I want to go home...
49623,L300560,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You've got to go to sleep now.
49624,L300559,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What?
49625,L300557,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ..."
49626,L300556,u1463,m99,INDIANA,It's okay. You're all right now.
49627,L300507,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Maybe... someday.  Not today.
49628,L300506,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
49629,L300505,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I'm not leaving without those stones.
49630,L300504,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
49631,L300503,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I'm going down.
49632,L300502,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Wait -- what're you doing?
49633,L300496,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Quiet!
49634,L300495,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Let's go! Let's get out of here!
49635,L300492,u1463,m99,INDIANA,No... the heart's still beating!
49636,L300491,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
49637,L300490,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction."
49638,L300489,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What is it...?
49639,L300484,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Willie!
49640,L300483,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!"
49641,L300479,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I am -- it looks horrible!
49642,L300478,u1463,m99,INDIANA,That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
49643,L300477,u1468,m99,WILLIE,There's a hole! I found a square hole!
49644,L300475,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
49645,L300474,u1463,m99,INDIANA,A fulcrum release lever!
49646,L300473,u1468,m99,WILLIE,A what?!
49647,L300472,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!"
49648,L300470,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!"
49649,L300469,u1468,m99,WILLIE,There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
49650,L300465,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!"
49651,L300464,u1463,m99,INDIANA,WILLIE?!
49652,L300460,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!"
49653,L300459,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What?!
49654,L300436,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!"
49655,L300435,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner."
49656,L300434,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Oh no -- oh no!!
49657,L300432,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!"
49658,L300431,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Get -- the -- bug -- off!
49659,L300430,u1463,m99,INDIANA,What -- the bug?
49660,L300429,u1468,m99,WILLIE,No -- don't you see -- crawling --
49661,L300417,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door."
49662,L300416,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
49663,L300415,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Dr. Jones?
49664,L300414,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Don't catch cold.
49665,L300413,u1468,m99,WILLIE,We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
49666,L300412,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie..."
49667,L300411,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?"
49668,L300410,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?"
49669,L300409,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?"
49670,L300408,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You're talking to an authority in that area.
49671,L300407,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Primitive sexual practices?
49672,L300404,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain ""nocturnal activities"" --"
49673,L300403,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
49674,L300402,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?"
49675,L300401,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?"
49676,L300399,u1463,m99,INDIANA,No -- real food.
49677,L300398,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Not leftovers?
49678,L300334,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I've never been so hungry in my life...
49679,L300333,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way."
49680,L300332,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Maybe he likes older women.
49681,L300331,u1468,m99,WILLIE,That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
49682,L300308,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub."
49683,L300307,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
49684,L300283,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner..."
49685,L300282,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Any more complaints?
49686,L300280,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
49687,L300279,u1463,m99,INDIANA,He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
49688,L300278,u1468,m99,WILLIE,He's afraid of something.
49689,L300268,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Just try and control yourself.
49690,L300267,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Couldn't keep away, huh?"
49691,L300265,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
49692,L300264,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
49693,L300261,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
49694,L300260,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
49695,L300259,u1468,m99,WILLIE,That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
49696,L300258,u1463,m99,INDIANA,It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
49697,L300257,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What does the writing say?
49698,L300256,u1463,m99,INDIANA,The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
49699,L300253,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Maybe...
49700,L300252,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?"
49701,L300251,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory..."
49702,L300250,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Oh really?
49703,L300249,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I'd like to find one of those myself.
49704,L300248,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince."
49705,L300247,u1463,m99,INDIANA,What about the future?
49706,L300246,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that ""a girl could go places in the Orient..."" So, look where I got."
49707,L300245,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?"
49708,L300243,u1468,m99,WILLIE,He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
49709,L300242,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
49710,L300241,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
49711,L300240,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
49712,L300238,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I know the feeling...
49713,L300237,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
49714,L300234,u1463,m99,INDIANA,That's good -- you're doing fine.
49715,L300233,u1468,m99,WILLIE,It's starting to let go!
49716,L300232,u1463,m99,INDIANA,What's happening?
49717,L300231,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Keep stroking it!
49718,L300230,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
49719,L300229,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!"
49720,L300228,u1468,m99,WILLIE,THE WHAT?!
49721,L300227,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae."
49722,L300226,u1468,m99,WILLIE,PET IT??!!
49723,L300225,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake."
49724,L300224,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Just one arm!
49725,L300223,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Can you move your arm?
49726,L300222,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What?!
49727,L300221,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now."
49728,L300219,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!"
49729,L300218,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Don't let it curl around you!
49730,L300217,u1468,m99,WILLIE,It's pulling me deeper!
49731,L300216,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Don't let it pull you deeper!
49732,L300214,u1463,m99,INDIANA,First of all -- don't panic!
49733,L300213,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What?!
49734,L300212,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea."
49735,L300211,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!"
49736,L300210,u1468,m99,WILLIE,A SNAKE!!
49737,L300209,u1463,m99,INDIANA,A what...?
49738,L300208,u1468,m99,WILLIE,A snake!
49739,L300207,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?"
49740,L300206,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Indy! Help me!
49741,L300205,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Somehow I feel safer in here.
49742,L300204,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water."
49743,L300203,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach."
49744,L300202,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now."
49745,L300179,u1463,m99,INDIANA,It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
49746,L300178,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What'd he say now?
49747,L300170,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Their children?
49748,L300169,u1463,m99,INDIANA,And then they took their children.
49749,L300154,u1463,m99,INDIANA,It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
49750,L300153,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Took what?
49751,L300135,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too..."
49752,L300134,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"God, I am starving, but I can't eat this..."
49753,L300132,u1463,m99,INDIANA,He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
49754,L300131,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
49755,L300130,u1463,m99,INDIANA,The old man saw it in a dream.
49756,L300129,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What do you mean -- how?
49757,L300128,u1463,m99,INDIANA,He told me they knew I was coming here.
49758,L300127,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What'd he say?
49759,L300126,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
49760,L300125,u1463,m99,INDIANA,India...
49761,L300124,u1468,m99,WILLIE,No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
49762,L300123,u1463,m99,INDIANA,You all right?
49763,L300119,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!"
49764,L300118,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!"
49765,L300093,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Oh yeah?
49766,L300092,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me."
49767,L300091,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?"
49768,L300090,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?"
49769,L300086,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
49770,L300085,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Siam.
49771,L300084,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
49772,L300079,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!"
49773,L300078,u1468,m99,WILLIE,What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
49774,L300073,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!"
49775,L300072,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You don't look very good.
49776,L300071,u1463,m99,INDIANA,Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
49777,L300070,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!"
49778,L300069,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Relax, I've been giving him lessons."
49779,L300068,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!"
49780,L300059,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Who cares? Where's that diamond!
49781,L300058,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!"
49782,L300053,u1463,m99,INDIANA,"No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao."
49783,L300052,u1468,m99,WILLIE,"Hey, he's not a waiter..."
49784,L300051,u1463,m99,INDIANA,I like the service here.
49785,L300642,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,"Willie, come on!"
49786,L300641,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
49787,L300355,u1468,m99,WILLIE,I'm going to puke in it...
49788,L300354,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,What for?
49789,L300353,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Give me your hat...
49790,L300190,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
49791,L300189,u1468,m99,WILLIE,Figures...
49792,L300188,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
49793,L300187,u1468,m99,WILLIE,This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
49794,L300115,u1468,m99,WILLIE,You got it!
49795,L300114,u1467,m99,SHORT ROUND,I get it!
49796,L303627,u1469,m100,AL,Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
49797,L303626,u1475,m100,JOE,What are you doing?
49798,L303551,u1475,m100,JOE,That's nice.
49799,L303550,u1469,m100,AL,"In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to."
49800,L303543,u1469,m100,AL,"Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two....."
49801,L303542,u1475,m100,JOE,I'll get us out of here.
49802,L303541,u1469,m100,AL,"Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out."
49803,L303537,u1469,m100,AL,"I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you."
49804,L303536,u1475,m100,JOE,Awwww...
49805,L303533,u1475,m100,JOE,I want to thank you for what you've done.
49806,L303532,u1469,m100,AL,I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
49807,L303531,u1475,m100,JOE,"I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow."
49808,L303528,u1475,m100,JOE,You're lovely.
49809,L303527,u1469,m100,AL,She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
49810,L303523,u1475,m100,JOE,"Yeah, sure."
49811,L303522,u1469,m100,AL,You're a lucky man.
49812,L303515,u1475,m100,JOE,They can?
49813,L303514,u1469,m100,AL,She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
49814,L303513,u1469,m100,AL,I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
49815,L303508,u1475,m100,JOE,Oh no!
49816,L303507,u1469,m100,AL,Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
49817,L303506,u1469,m100,AL,Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
49818,L303503,u1475,m100,JOE,You've changed your mind.
49819,L303502,u1469,m100,AL,She is beautiful.
49820,L303491,u1475,m100,JOE,No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
49821,L303490,u1469,m100,AL,I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
49822,L303489,u1475,m100,JOE,You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
49823,L303488,u1469,m100,AL,"Now, you're too suspicious."
49824,L303487,u1475,m100,JOE,She works for them.
49825,L303486,u1469,m100,AL,Rene?
49826,L303485,u1475,m100,JOE,Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
49827,L303484,u1469,m100,AL,About what?
49828,L303483,u1475,m100,JOE,I have been... I think you're right.
49829,L303482,u1469,m100,AL,Keep thinking.
49830,L303481,u1475,m100,JOE,I can always flush you down the toilet.
49831,L303480,u1475,m100,JOE,Looks like you can have all you want.
49832,L303479,u1469,m100,AL,Gimme a minute.
49833,L303478,u1475,m100,JOE,We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
49834,L303477,u1469,m100,AL,"Never mind that, where are we now."
49835,L303476,u1475,m100,JOE,Where've you been?
49836,L303475,u1469,m100,AL,Be quiet.
49837,L303466,u1469,m100,AL,Losing power. The laser drained it.
49838,L303465,u1475,m100,JOE,What happened?
49839,L303456,u1475,m100,JOE,I don't know.
49840,L303455,u1469,m100,AL,What exactly?
49841,L303454,u1475,m100,JOE,Do something.
49842,L303450,u1469,m100,AL,"Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip."
49843,L303449,u1475,m100,JOE,"Pretty advanced, isn't it?"
49844,L303432,u1475,m100,JOE,"Well, don't let it. What are you doing?"
49845,L303431,u1469,m100,AL,This may hurt.
49846,L303430,u1469,m100,AL,"And don't let her know, either."
49847,L303429,u1475,m100,JOE,There's a lot you don't know.
49848,L303415,u1469,m100,AL,"GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho."
49849,L303414,u1475,m100,JOE,Dieter!
49850,L303413,u1469,m100,AL,"The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now."
49851,L303412,u1475,m100,JOE,He aready made the deal..
49852,L303410,u1469,m100,AL,...Shit! It's just money.
49853,L303409,u1475,m100,JOE,Holy...
49854,L303401,u1475,m100,JOE,Aim what?
49855,L303400,u1469,m100,AL,Aim just in front of his face.
49856,L303396,u1475,m100,JOE,Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
49857,L303395,u1469,m100,AL,Are you alright?
49858,L303386,u1469,m100,AL,"Don't worry, I can."
49859,L303385,u1475,m100,JOE,I can't handle that thing.
49860,L303384,u1469,m100,AL,Do it.
49861,L303382,u1469,m100,AL,He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
49862,L303381,u1475,m100,JOE,"Then, why'd he lead us here."
49863,L303380,u1469,m100,AL,He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
49864,L303379,u1475,m100,JOE,And Dieter?
49865,L303378,u1469,m100,AL,It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
49866,L303349,u1475,m100,JOE,Where?
49867,L303348,u1469,m100,AL,While he makes the run.
49868,L303347,u1475,m100,JOE,He hung us up dry.
49869,L303341,u1469,m100,AL,It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
49870,L303340,u1475,m100,JOE,Well...?
49871,L303339,u1469,m100,AL,Left...The one with the red dot.
49872,L303332,u1469,m100,AL,Cash.
49873,L303331,u1475,m100,JOE,haka xuki. What's that mean?
49874,L303330,u1469,m100,AL,haka xuki.
49875,L303329,u1469,m100,AL,"You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman."
49876,L303328,u1475,m100,JOE,What was it? What'd I say?
49877,L303326,u1469,m100,AL,Just say the words. Just like I told you.
49878,L303325,u1475,m100,JOE,"Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot."
49879,L303324,u1469,m100,AL,Not sure at all.
49880,L303323,u1475,m100,JOE,You sure this will work?
49881,L303320,u1475,m100,JOE,I was afraid of that.
49882,L303319,u1469,m100,AL,I've got an idea.
49883,L303318,u1469,m100,AL,Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
49884,L303311,u1475,m100,JOE,Come on.
49885,L303310,u1469,m100,AL,It's him.
49886,L303295,u1475,m100,JOE,"Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got..."
49887,L303294,u1469,m100,AL,I don't trust her.
49888,L303293,u1475,m100,JOE,Probably.
49889,L303292,u1469,m100,AL,"Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind."
49890,L303275,u1469,m100,AL,No. You can't trust her.
49891,L303274,u1475,m100,JOE,I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
49892,L303249,u1475,m100,JOE,You were with GRUNER!
49893,L303248,u1469,m100,AL,He was with Gruner!
49894,L303243,u1475,m100,JOE,
49895,L303242,u1469,m100,AL,"Never mind, just say it."
49896,L303241,u1475,m100,JOE,What?
49897,L303225,u1469,m100,AL,Neither can they.
49898,L303224,u1475,m100,JOE,I can't see a thing.
49899,L303223,u1469,m100,AL,Door to the right. Get up and run.
49900,L303222,u1469,m100,AL,A hard left. A hard left.
49901,L303221,u1475,m100,JOE,Ow!
49902,L303213,u1469,m100,AL,Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
49903,L303212,u1475,m100,JOE,What are you doing?
49904,L303210,u1475,m100,JOE,...imagine a better grape for the region.
49905,L303209,u1469,m100,AL,You have to! Quickly!
49906,L303208,u1475,m100,JOE,I can't...
49907,L303205,u1469,m100,AL,Drink lots of water.
49908,L303204,u1475,m100,JOE,What next!
49909,L303199,u1475,m100,JOE,Too late.
49910,L303198,u1469,m100,AL,...drink it.
49911,L303190,u1475,m100,JOE,Don't worry!
49912,L303189,u1469,m100,AL,Don't touch a thing.
49913,L303184,u1475,m100,JOE,I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
49914,L303183,u1469,m100,AL,One of your instincts?
49915,L303182,u1475,m100,JOE,"I told you, I have a feeling..."
49916,L303181,u1469,m100,AL,Yeah...You've fallen for her.
49917,L303148,u1475,m100,JOE,You think. That's what you're good at.
49918,L303147,u1469,m100,AL,What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
49919,L303146,u1475,m100,JOE,It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
49920,L303145,u1469,m100,AL,Relax. Make your mind a blank.
49921,L303144,u1469,m100,AL,Relax. Let me do this.
49922,L303143,u1475,m100,JOE,What do I do?
49923,L303142,u1469,m100,AL,`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
49924,L303135,u1475,m100,JOE,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone..."
49925,L303134,u1469,m100,AL,Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
49926,L303133,u1475,m100,JOE,Where are you going?
49927,L303132,u1469,m100,AL,Just stay here and rest.
49928,L303131,u1475,m100,JOE,Sapporo..
49929,L303130,u1469,m100,AL,That's not funny.
49930,L303129,u1475,m100,JOE,Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
49931,L303126,u1475,m100,JOE,I can't keep up.
49932,L303125,u1469,m100,AL,"Come on, she's getting away."
49933,L303124,u1469,m100,AL,"Run, stupid!"
49934,L303123,u1475,m100,JOE,On what?
49935,L303122,u1469,m100,AL,Follow her.
49936,L303121,u1475,m100,JOE,What do I do?
49937,L303120,u1475,m100,JOE,"I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........"
49938,L303119,u1469,m100,AL,"We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself."
49939,L303118,u1475,m100,JOE,Don't you think I stand out like this.
49940,L303117,u1469,m100,AL,Fountainhead of High-Tech.
49941,L303116,u1475,m100,JOE,Osaka?
49942,L303115,u1469,m100,AL,Osaka.
49943,L303114,u1475,m100,JOE,That's good. It's not better. Where?
49944,L303113,u1469,m100,AL,Better. I found Ryuji.
49945,L303112,u1475,m100,JOE,You found her.
49946,L303111,u1469,m100,AL,Bingo.
49947,L303110,u1475,m100,JOE,Why don't you get out of my face.
49948,L303109,u1469,m100,AL,Some agent you are.
49949,L303108,u1475,m100,JOE,It wasn't like that.
49950,L303107,u1469,m100,AL,You been had. We have.
49951,L303103,u1469,m100,AL,I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
49952,L303102,u1475,m100,JOE,No. What will you do.
49953,L303101,u1475,m100,JOE,"No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?"
49954,L303096,u1469,m100,AL,You get time off to sleep.
49955,L303095,u1475,m100,JOE,It's not your time. I get time off.
49956,L303094,u1469,m100,AL,And on my time.
49957,L303093,u1469,m100,AL,Shit! You're in love.
49958,L303092,u1475,m100,JOE,She's got the most beautiful...s
49959,L303090,u1475,m100,JOE,"Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week."
49960,L303089,u1469,m100,AL,Is that all?
49961,L303088,u1475,m100,JOE,"Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo.."
49962,L303087,u1469,m100,AL,What she say. What'd you get out of her?
49963,L303086,u1475,m100,JOE,I don't know!
49964,L303085,u1469,m100,AL,What Happened?
49965,L303055,u1475,m100,JOE,"I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it."
49966,L303054,u1469,m100,AL,Joe! It's 56 hours!
49967,L303053,u1475,m100,JOE,You shut down your sensors.
49968,L303052,u1469,m100,AL,Oh come on.
49969,L303051,u1475,m100,JOE,You got any books in there?
49970,L303050,u1469,m100,AL,What am I supposed to do?
49971,L303049,u1475,m100,JOE,I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
49972,L303048,u1469,m100,AL,What if she says something important?
49973,L303047,u1475,m100,JOE,It's embarrassing.
49974,L303046,u1475,m100,JOE,You can't listen. You can't watch either.
49975,L303045,u1469,m100,AL,What is it?
49976,L303044,u1475,m100,JOE,Not her. You!
49977,L303043,u1469,m100,AL,You're doing great with her.
49978,L303042,u1475,m100,JOE,This just won't work.
49979,L303041,u1469,m100,AL,"What is it, your charm?"
49980,L303023,u1475,m100,JOE,Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
49981,L303022,u1469,m100,AL,"Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know."
49982,L303021,u1475,m100,JOE,Maybe she's telling the truth.
49983,L303020,u1469,m100,AL,She's the toughest to read.
49984,L303019,u1475,m100,JOE,Even Rene?
49985,L303018,u1475,m100,JOE,Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
49986,L303017,u1469,m100,AL,Voice stress analyzer.
49987,L303016,u1475,m100,JOE,How do you know?
49988,L303015,u1469,m100,AL,They're all in it.
49989,L303009,u1475,m100,JOE,...I've lost something. I must get it back.
49990,L303008,u1469,m100,AL,"Joe, be careful!"
49991,L302982,u1469,m100,AL,Don't get too cute.
49992,L302981,u1475,m100,JOE,"My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place."
49993,L302980,u1469,m100,AL,"He recognises you, throw him off."
49994,L302969,u1469,m100,AL,It lends you an air of mystery.
49995,L302968,u1475,m100,JOE,I don't know what's going on.
49996,L302967,u1469,m100,AL,Just don't show fear.
49997,L302962,u1475,m100,JOE,Killer!
49998,L302961,u1469,m100,AL,The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
49999,L302960,u1475,m100,JOE,Which one?
50000,L302956,u1469,m100,AL,Just hold them close and stay still.
50001,L302955,u1475,m100,JOE,I feel like an idiot.
50002,L302950,u1475,m100,JOE,Are you serious?
50003,L302949,u1469,m100,AL,Follow that busboy.
50004,L302948,u1469,m100,AL,The drinks...Stay on them.
50005,L302947,u1475,m100,JOE,What glasses.
50006,L302946,u1469,m100,AL,"Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses."
50007,L302943,u1475,m100,JOE,That's a big if.
50008,L302942,u1469,m100,AL,"Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved."
50009,L302941,u1475,m100,JOE,"You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know."
50010,L302940,u1475,m100,JOE,"Who, me?"
50011,L302939,u1469,m100,AL,"You're not just after this girl, are you?"
50012,L302921,u1475,m100,JOE,That place. By the window.
50013,L302920,u1469,m100,AL,Get close to them.
50014,L302916,u1475,m100,JOE,You have no taste.
50015,L302915,u1469,m100,AL,They both look good to me.
50016,L302914,u1475,m100,JOE,The beautiful one.
50017,L302913,u1469,m100,AL,Which one is she?
50018,L302912,u1469,m100,AL,Doesn't.
50019,L302911,u1475,m100,JOE,"You want sophistication, it don't come cheap."
50020,L302910,u1469,m100,AL,What did that cost?
50021,L302904,u1475,m100,JOE,Why not?!
50022,L302903,u1469,m100,AL,Not that tie with that coat.
50023,L302900,u1475,m100,JOE,But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
50024,L302899,u1469,m100,AL,It is my business. It's my name.
50025,L302898,u1475,m100,JOE,Mind your own business.
50026,L302896,u1475,m100,JOE,Not blue enough.
50027,L302895,u1469,m100,AL,Much too blue.
50028,L302891,u1475,m100,JOE,This...is not going to work out.
50029,L302890,u1469,m100,AL,You really like that shirt?
50030,L302889,u1469,m100,AL,Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
50031,L302888,u1475,m100,JOE,What is it?
50032,L302885,u1469,m100,AL,Is something glinting?
50033,L302884,u1475,m100,JOE,What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
50034,L302883,u1469,m100,AL,But what's it look like?
50035,L302881,u1469,m100,AL,What are you looking at?
50036,L302880,u1475,m100,JOE,"Now, where would I be?"
50037,L302876,u1469,m100,AL,"But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire."
50038,L302875,u1475,m100,JOE,Yeah. I did it.
50039,L302874,u1469,m100,AL,Well you did it today.
50040,L302873,u1475,m100,JOE,I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
50041,L302872,u1475,m100,JOE,Rene...
50042,L302871,u1469,m100,AL,"You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum."
50043,L302870,u1475,m100,JOE,I made it work.
50044,L302869,u1469,m100,AL,It worked.
50045,L302868,u1475,m100,JOE,Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
50046,L302867,u1469,m100,AL,Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
50047,L302866,u1475,m100,JOE,Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
50048,L302865,u1469,m100,AL,Without your pants.
50049,L302864,u1475,m100,JOE,To the hotel. To register.
50050,L302863,u1469,m100,AL,Where are you going?
50051,L302862,u1475,m100,JOE,...Rene...
50052,L302861,u1469,m100,AL,What happened?
50053,L302851,u1469,m100,AL,No...you idiot!
50054,L302850,u1475,m100,JOE,...Joe.
50055,L302836,u1469,m100,AL,Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
50056,L302835,u1475,m100,JOE,What?
50057,L302834,u1469,m100,AL,Touch her.
50058,L302828,u1475,m100,JOE,Where are you staying?
50059,L302827,u1469,m100,AL,Where is she staying?
50060,L302826,u1475,m100,JOE,Wait.
50061,L302825,u1469,m100,AL,Wait.
50062,L302813,u1475,m100,JOE,.
50063,L302812,u1469,m100,AL,.
50064,L302797,u1469,m100,AL,Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
50065,L302796,u1475,m100,JOE,What?
50066,L302795,u1469,m100,AL,"Don't just stand there, say something."
50067,L302794,u1475,m100,JOE,What do I do?
50068,L302791,u1469,m100,AL,What can I do? You're on your own.
50069,L302790,u1475,m100,JOE,"Help me out, will you?"
50070,L302787,u1469,m100,AL,How should I know?
50071,L302786,u1475,m100,JOE,Which language?
50072,L302785,u1469,m100,AL,Try another language.
50073,L302784,u1475,m100,JOE,She doesn't seem to understand.
50074,L302783,u1469,m100,AL,What's happening?
50075,L302782,u1475,m100,JOE,You're beautiful..
50076,L302780,u1475,m100,JOE,She's beautiful...! What do I do?
50077,L302779,u1469,m100,AL,What is it?
50078,L302778,u1469,m100,AL,You're out of shape.
50079,L302777,u1475,m100,JOE,She's...pretty fast.
50080,L302774,u1469,m100,AL,Follow it.
50081,L302773,u1475,m100,JOE,"This must be business, there's nothing else here."
50082,L302772,u1475,m100,JOE,A girl.
50083,L302771,u1469,m100,AL,What was?
50084,L302770,u1475,m100,JOE,Beautiful!
50085,L302768,u1475,m100,JOE,Are you screwing with any nerves?
50086,L302767,u1469,m100,AL,What? What do you mean?
50087,L302766,u1475,m100,JOE,"Al, are you doing anything in there?"
50088,L302763,u1475,m100,JOE,Where are you going? Wait!
50089,L302762,u1469,m100,AL,"Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while."
50090,L302761,u1469,m100,AL,"For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!"
50091,L302760,u1475,m100,JOE,It's sand.
50092,L302759,u1469,m100,AL,Why not?
50093,L302758,u1475,m100,JOE,I don't want to eat it.
50094,L302757,u1469,m100,AL,Eat it.
50095,L302756,u1475,m100,JOE,Eat it?
50096,L302755,u1469,m100,AL,The sand.
50097,L302754,u1475,m100,JOE,Now what?
50098,L302753,u1469,m100,AL,I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
50099,L302752,u1475,m100,JOE,You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
50100,L302751,u1469,m100,AL,You eat it.
50101,L302750,u1475,m100,JOE,"Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?"
50102,L302749,u1475,m100,JOE,Little late for that.
50103,L302748,u1469,m100,AL,"Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head."
50104,L302747,u1475,m100,JOE,Good Idea!
50105,L302746,u1469,m100,AL,Swim.
50106,L302745,u1475,m100,JOE,"The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?"
50107,L302744,u1469,m100,AL,Do you notice anything.
50108,L302743,u1475,m100,JOE,...Just beautiful.
50109,L302742,u1469,m100,AL,What is it?
50110,L302741,u1475,m100,JOE,Holy shit!
50111,L302740,u1469,m100,AL,Just get there.
50112,L302739,u1475,m100,JOE,Eating sushi?
50113,L302738,u1469,m100,AL,How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
50114,L302737,u1475,m100,JOE,The beach?
50115,L302736,u1469,m100,AL,The beach.
50116,L302735,u1475,m100,JOE,Now what?
50117,L302732,u1475,m100,JOE,You leave my glands alone!
50118,L302731,u1469,m100,AL,Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
50119,L302730,u1475,m100,JOE,"I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?"
50120,L302729,u1469,m100,AL,You'll be me.
50121,L302728,u1475,m100,JOE,"Oh yeah, to what?"
50122,L302727,u1469,m100,AL,"Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona."
50123,L302726,u1475,m100,JOE,What's wrong with how I carry myself.
50124,L302725,u1469,m100,AL,It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
50125,L302724,u1475,m100,JOE,It's just not enough.
50126,L302723,u1469,m100,AL,We'll change your appearance.
50127,L302722,u1475,m100,JOE,They'll know who I am.
50128,L302720,u1469,m100,AL,"Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy."
50129,L302719,u1475,m100,JOE,...and a license to kill...
50130,L302717,u1469,m100,AL,You are in trouble. Now do it.
50131,L302716,u1475,m100,JOE,I'll get in trouble.
50132,L302715,u1469,m100,AL,Who cares?
50133,L302714,u1475,m100,JOE,It's illegal.
50134,L302713,u1469,m100,AL,Why not?
50135,L302712,u1475,m100,JOE,I can't do that.
50136,L302711,u1469,m100,AL,Use my credit cards.
50137,L302710,u1475,m100,JOE,I don't have any.
50138,L302709,u1469,m100,AL,What about it?
50139,L302708,u1475,m100,JOE,What about money?
50140,L302706,u1475,m100,JOE,We get on which plane?
50141,L302705,u1469,m100,AL,We get on a plane.
50142,L302704,u1475,m100,JOE,You mean...just leave.
50143,L302701,u1469,m100,AL,"You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities..."
50144,L302700,u1475,m100,JOE,"Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone."
50145,L302699,u1469,m100,AL,Send a man there. A secret agent.
50146,L302698,u1475,m100,JOE,What do we do?
50147,L302693,u1469,m100,AL,"Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique..."
50148,L302692,u1475,m100,JOE,What is it?
50149,L302689,u1469,m100,AL,Nothing. You just do nothing.
50150,L302688,u1475,m100,JOE,What am I supposed to do?
50151,L302687,u1469,m100,AL,"Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up."
50152,L302685,u1469,m100,AL,Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
50153,L302684,u1475,m100,JOE,Who is it?
50154,L302682,u1469,m100,AL,Good. Get to a phone.
50155,L302681,u1475,m100,JOE,I'm at the airport.
50156,L302680,u1469,m100,AL,I'm back.
50157,L302678,u1475,m100,JOE,"The airport! Hey, wait a minute."
50158,L302677,u1469,m100,AL,I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
50159,L302676,u1475,m100,JOE,"Just scratched my arm, why?"
50160,L302675,u1469,m100,AL,Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
50161,L302674,u1475,m100,JOE,Nothing!
50162,L302673,u1469,m100,AL,Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
50163,L302671,u1469,m100,AL,"You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away."
50164,L302670,u1475,m100,JOE,I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
50165,L302669,u1469,m100,AL,You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
50166,L302668,u1475,m100,JOE,You need ID in there?
50167,L302667,u1469,m100,AL,Don't know.
50168,L302666,u1475,m100,JOE,Gone where?
50169,L302665,u1469,m100,AL,They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
50170,L302664,u1475,m100,JOE,That's not a good idea.
50171,L302663,u1469,m100,AL,That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
50172,L302662,u1475,m100,JOE,Black suits and helmets.
50173,L302661,u1469,m100,AL,What do you mean?
50174,L302660,u1475,m100,JOE,Like the guys that attacked us.
50175,L302658,u1475,m100,JOE,I can't remember..
50176,L302657,u1469,m100,AL,"Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?"
50177,L302655,u1475,m100,JOE,The man.
50178,L302654,u1469,m100,AL,Who did?
50179,L302653,u1475,m100,JOE,I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
50180,L302652,u1469,m100,AL,Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
50181,L302651,u1475,m100,JOE,A lab and equipment.
50182,L302647,u1475,m100,JOE,Where are we going?
50183,L302646,u1469,m100,AL,Take a left and your next right.
50184,L302645,u1475,m100,JOE,Corridor A.
50185,L302644,u1469,m100,AL,What does it say.
50186,L302643,u1475,m100,JOE,Which way do I go?
50187,L302642,u1469,m100,AL,With Authority!
50188,L302641,u1475,m100,JOE,Just walk down the hall?
50189,L302640,u1469,m100,AL,"Go out, take your first left."
50190,L302639,u1475,m100,JOE,Now what.
50191,L302638,u1469,m100,AL,See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
50192,L302637,u1475,m100,JOE,Door's locked.
50193,L302636,u1469,m100,AL,We have to get out of here.
50194,L302635,u1475,m100,JOE,I don't like the sound of that.
50195,L302630,u1475,m100,JOE,I'll sue.
50196,L302629,u1469,m100,AL,Sue them.
50197,L302611,u1475,m100,JOE,"Why don't you just get out, leave me alone."
50198,L302610,u1469,m100,AL,They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
50199,L302609,u1469,m100,AL,I'm not gonna make it easy.
50200,L302608,u1475,m100,JOE,Find You?
50201,L302607,u1469,m100,AL,Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
50202,L302602,u1475,m100,JOE,I'm not leaving until you do.
50203,L302601,u1469,m100,AL,"Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here."
50204,L302600,u1475,m100,JOE,Thanks.
50205,L302599,u1469,m100,AL,We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
50206,L302598,u1475,m100,JOE,I did. I brought you back here.
50207,L302597,u1469,m100,AL,You gotta help.
50208,L302596,u1475,m100,JOE,What do you mean we.
50209,L302595,u1469,m100,AL,You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
50210,L302594,u1475,m100,JOE,You are CRAZY!
50211,L302593,u1469,m100,AL,I am. You are.
50212,L302592,u1475,m100,JOE,Yeah...Who is?
50213,L302591,u1469,m100,AL,"They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."""
50214,L302590,u1475,m100,JOE,Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
50215,L302589,u1469,m100,AL,I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
50216,L302588,u1475,m100,JOE,They could put you back in the tube..
50217,L302586,u1469,m100,AL,I don't know. I don't want to find out.
50218,L302585,u1475,m100,JOE,JOE Or what?
50219,L302580,u1475,m100,JOE,Why?
50220,L302579,u1469,m100,AL,It can't take that long.
50221,L302558,u1475,m100,JOE,Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
50222,L302557,u1469,m100,AL,Did you hear that?

50298,L302439,u1469,m100,AL,"I told you, my name is Al."
50299,L302438,u1475,m100,JOE,"It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?"

50307,L302428,u1475,m100,JOE,"Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say."
50308,L302427,u1469,m100,AL,Right.
50309,L302426,u1475,m100,JOE,"You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything."
50310,L302425,u1469,m100,AL,No.

50615,L303504,u1479,m100,RENE,"What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him."
50616,L303501,u1479,m100,RENE,They'll listen to what we say in here.

50618,L303499,u1479,m100,RENE,That I really don't know.
50619,L303498,u1475,m100,JOE,What did you tell them?
50620,L303497,u1479,m100,RENE,They asked about you.
50621,L303496,u1475,m100,JOE,Looks like they can. What did they do?

50630,L303427,u1479,m100,RENE,He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
50631,L303426,u1475,m100,JOE,Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
50632,L303425,u1479,m100,RENE,This going to work?

50640,L303390,u1475,m100,JOE,I said just relax. I'm in full control.
50641,L303389,u1479,m100,RENE,What?
50642,L303364,u1475,m100,JOE,Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
50643,L303363,u1479,m100,RENE,He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
50644,L303362,u1475,m100,JOE,Why'd you ask him.
50645,L303360,u1475,m100,JOE,Oh.
50646,L303359,u1479,m100,RENE,I asked him.
50647,L303358,u1475,m100,JOE,Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
50648,L303357,u1479,m100,RENE,Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
50649,L303356,u1475,m100,JOE,What?
50650,L303355,u1479,m100,RENE,Hong Kong.
50651,L303354,u1475,m100,JOE,"If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?"
50652,L303351,u1475,m100,JOE,Where would you go to sell a chip?
50653,L303350,u1479,m100,RENE,Where what?
50654,L303346,u1479,m100,RENE,"Too late, they won't come back out till morning."
50655,L303345,u1475,m100,JOE,Get us one.
50656,L303344,u1479,m100,RENE,That must be him. Water taxi.
50657,L303337,u1475,m100,JOE,Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
50658,L303336,u1479,m100,RENE,How?
50659,L303335,u1475,m100,JOE,We figure out if it's in here.
50660,L303334,u1479,m100,RENE,Now what?
50661,L303322,u1475,m100,JOE,He plays it all the time.
50662,L303321,u1479,m100,RENE,What?
50663,L303316,u1479,m100,RENE,Then where's the chip.
50664,L303315,u1475,m100,JOE,"Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous."
50665,L303314,u1479,m100,RENE,This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
50666,L303313,u1475,m100,JOE,Beats me.
50667,L303312,u1479,m100,RENE,Where we going?
50668,L303308,u1479,m100,RENE,It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
50669,L303307,u1475,m100,JOE,And you?
50670,L303306,u1479,m100,RENE,Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
50671,L303305,u1475,m100,JOE,And Dieter.
50672,L303304,u1479,m100,RENE,Ryuji and Gruner.
50673,L303303,u1475,m100,JOE,Who was?
50674,L303302,u1479,m100,RENE,They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
50675,L303301,u1475,m100,JOE,What's Gruner like?
50676,L303300,u1475,m100,JOE,You think I'm like that?
50677,L303299,u1479,m100,RENE,"Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious."
50678,L303298,u1475,m100,JOE,Then why are you smiling like that?
50679,L303297,u1479,m100,RENE,Oh sure.
50680,L303296,u1475,m100,JOE,You don't believe me.
50681,L303291,u1475,m100,JOE,Get your things.
50682,L303290,u1479,m100,RENE,Hiroshima.
50683,L303289,u1475,m100,JOE,What is it?
50684,L303288,u1479,m100,RENE,I don't know. He mentioned a city.
50685,L303286,u1475,m100,JOE,Got to trust someone.
50686,L303285,u1479,m100,RENE,How do you know you can trust me?
50687,L303284,u1475,m100,JOE,The most important one. Can you help me find him?
50688,L303283,u1479,m100,RENE,One chip?
50689,L303282,u1475,m100,JOE,A chip. Goes in a computer.
50690,L303281,u1479,m100,RENE,What'd he steal?
50691,L303280,u1475,m100,JOE,We're very close.
50692,L303279,u1479,m100,RENE,He must be a good friend.
50693,L303278,u1475,m100,JOE,He stole something. From a friend of mine.
50694,L303277,u1479,m100,RENE,What's he done?
50695,L303276,u1475,m100,JOE,You know where he went?
50696,L303270,u1479,m100,RENE,"Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?"
50697,L303269,u1475,m100,JOE,I'm just on vacation.
50698,L303268,u1479,m100,RENE,Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
50699,L303267,u1475,m100,JOE,I'm sorry. What will you do?
50700,L303266,u1479,m100,RENE,This business is over.
50701,L303265,u1475,m100,JOE,Why?
50702,L303264,u1479,m100,RENE,I'm leaving too.
50703,L303263,u1475,m100,JOE,Food doesn't agree with me.
50704,L303262,u1479,m100,RENE,You're leaving.
50705,L303192,u1475,m100,JOE,This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
50706,L303191,u1479,m100,RENE,"I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it."
50707,L303179,u1479,m100,RENE,You did.
50708,L303178,u1475,m100,JOE,Who did?
50709,L303177,u1479,m100,RENE,No.
50710,L303176,u1475,m100,JOE,He didn't.
50711,L303175,u1479,m100,RENE,"No, he didn't do that."
50712,L303174,u1475,m100,JOE,Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
50713,L303173,u1479,m100,RENE,Last night?
50714,L303172,u1475,m100,JOE,Were you working for him last night?
50715,L303171,u1479,m100,RENE,Sometimes. I told you I did.
50716,L303170,u1475,m100,JOE,You work for Ryuji?
50717,L303169,u1479,m100,RENE,"I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans."
50718,L303168,u1475,m100,JOE,Why did they leave?
50719,L303167,u1479,m100,RENE,There's not much to tell.
50720,L303166,u1475,m100,JOE,What did you tell them?
50721,L303165,u1479,m100,RENE,They kidded me a little.
50722,L303164,u1475,m100,JOE,"Your friends, did they ask about me?"
50723,L303163,u1479,m100,RENE,What do you mean?
50724,L303162,u1475,m100,JOE,Who else is interested in me?
50725,L303161,u1479,m100,RENE,You seemed interesting.
50726,L303160,u1475,m100,JOE,Why?
50727,L303159,u1479,m100,RENE,Wanted to get to know you.
50728,L303158,u1475,m100,JOE,Why did you stay with me?
50729,L303157,u1475,m100,JOE,Why didn't you tell me?
50730,L303156,u1479,m100,RENE,They left. I had to go with them.
50731,L303155,u1475,m100,JOE,Why did you leave?
50732,L303150,u1475,m100,JOE,Why'd you run off?
50733,L303149,u1479,m100,RENE,Joe! What happened to you?
50734,L303083,u1479,m100,RENE,That depends...
50735,L303082,u1475,m100,JOE,"And you, what do you like?"
50736,L303081,u1479,m100,RENE,He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
50737,L303080,u1475,m100,JOE,How often they come here?
50738,L303079,u1479,m100,RENE,"To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details."

50745,L303072,u1475,m100,JOE,...Naw. Made that up.
50746,L303071,u1479,m100,RENE,"...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?"

50754,L303063,u1479,m100,RENE,Why do you do it?
50755,L303062,u1475,m100,JOE,But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
50756,L303061,u1479,m100,RENE,You talk to yourself.
50757,L303060,u1475,m100,JOE,"I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?"
50758,L303059,u1479,m100,RENE,That you're not crazy.

50816,L303010,u1480,m100,RYUJI,What could you find in this place?
50817,L302989,u1475,m100,JOE,It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
50818,L302988,u1480,m100,RYUJI,Must be a fulfilling occupation.
50819,L302188,u1475,m100,JOE,Thanks.

50867,L303969,u1485,m101,BARBARA,I heard them.
50868,L303968,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
50869,L303967,u1485,m101,BARBARA,"What's that outside, Daddy?"

50874,L303702,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs ""don't breathe any more of that dust in.""  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?"
50875,L303701,u1485,m101,BARBARA,She was playing with the Pooh doll.

50898,L304565,u1486,m101,BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE,Lowell?

50900,L304130,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?"
50901,L304129,u1486,m101,BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE,"Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look..."
50902,L304476,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie..."

50906,L304445,u1487,m101,CHARLIE PHILLIPS,Are you all right?
50907,L304444,u1487,m101,CHARLIE PHILLIPS,I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
50908,L304443,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?"
50909,L304442,u1487,m101,CHARLIE PHILLIPS,"Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented."
50910,L304441,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book."
50911,L304440,u1487,m101,CHARLIE PHILLIPS,It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
50912,L304439,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"It's a smear campaign, Charlie."
50913,L304438,u1487,m101,CHARLIE PHILLIPS,What? Forget it.
50914,L304437,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Push it.

50920,L304417,u1499,m101,LOWELL,We gotta hook up.
50921,L304416,u1487,m101,CHARLIE PHILLIPS,You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
50922,L304415,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?"
50923,L304632,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,"The sub-heading is, ""Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic."" It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it ""the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."""
50924,L304631,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Good.
50925,L304630,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,"Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you..."
50926,L304592,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
50927,L304591,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi..."

50931,L304379,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,What was that about?
50932,L304263,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
50933,L304262,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,"Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3."
50934,L304261,u1499,m101,LOWELL,When's the air date?
50935,L304079,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
50936,L304078,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,"Alright, alright."
50937,L304077,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?"
50938,L304076,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,I don't know what he was thinking.
50939,L304075,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses."
50940,L304074,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Shit...
50941,L303951,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world..."
50942,L303950,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,"What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?"
50943,L303949,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"What do you mean, what's it do?"
50944,L303948,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,What does that do?
50945,L303844,u1488,m101,DEBBIE DELUCA,Okay.
50946,L303843,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
50947,L304082,u1489,m101,DEBORAH,"Oh, I love that stuff."
50948,L304081,u1497,m101,LIANE,I'm cooking pasta primavera.

50950,L303712,u1497,m101,LIANE,How about you?
50951,L303711,u1489,m101,DEBORAH,Maybe later.
50952,L303710,u1497,m101,LIANE,Do you want more rice?

50954,L303704,u1489,m101,DEBORAH,Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
50955,L304636,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?"
50956,L304635,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
50957,L304458,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!"
50958,L304457,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it."
50959,L304456,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?"
50960,L304455,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
50961,L304454,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,What the hell are you doing?
50962,L304376,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared."
50963,L304375,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass..."
50964,L304374,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,Then what are you going to do?
50965,L304373,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No. I'm not going to take ""no"" for an answer. No."
50966,L304372,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"You're taking ""no"" for an answer?"
50967,L304371,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that."
50968,L304370,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"So, what are you going to do?"
50969,L304326,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living..."
50970,L304325,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!"
50971,L304324,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!"
50972,L304323,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,You're exaggerating!
50973,L304322,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear ""reasonable"" and ""tortious interference."" I hear... ""Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse."" I hear... ""Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!"" That's what I hear."
50974,L304321,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!"
50975,L304320,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer."
50976,L304319,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
50977,L304316,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?"
50978,L304315,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,"Yeah, I heard rumors."
50979,L304310,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
50980,L304309,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on ""60 Minutes""?"
50981,L304295,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,Lunch?
50982,L304294,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"""Tortious interference""? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio."
50983,L304258,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of ""Kools"" to the world.  ""Sealed"" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive."
50984,L304257,u1490,m101,DON HEWITT,I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
50985,L304318,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  ""Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."""
50986,L304317,u1491,m101,ERIC KLUSTER,And what are you implying?
50987,L304312,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Before you go...
50988,L304311,u1491,m101,ERIC KLUSTER,"So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave..."
50989,L304308,u1491,m101,ERIC KLUSTER,"We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show..."
50990,L304307,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, I'm not..."
50991,L304306,u1491,m101,ERIC KLUSTER,I'm afraid you are.
50992,L304305,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I'm not touching my film...
50993,L304304,u1491,m101,ERIC KLUSTER,"That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can."
50994,L304303,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?"
50995,L304302,u1491,m101,ERIC KLUSTER,"There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview."
50996,L304126,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,"You alright, Mr. Wigand?"
50997,L304125,u1510,m101,WIGAND,That computer has everything...
50998,L304123,u1510,m101,WIGAND,...my files! Personal correspondence...
50999,L304122,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,"We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat."
51000,L304121,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You can't take that... It's personal property...!
51001,L304117,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!"
51002,L304116,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,"Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?"
51003,L304115,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?"
51004,L304114,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
51005,L304111,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,"If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand..."
51006,L304110,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
51007,L304109,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
51008,L304108,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,"Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?"
51009,L304107,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What caliber is my gun?
51010,L304106,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,What caliber is your gun?
51011,L304105,u1510,m101,WIGAND,A gun? Yes.
51012,L304102,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Yes, I'm afraid I did."
51013,L304101,u1492,m101,FBI AGENT #2,"Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?"
51014,L303841,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Catch ya' later.
51015,L303840,u1493,m101,FELLING,Okay.
51016,L303839,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I'm gonna do a follow-up.
51017,L303838,u1493,m101,FELLING,"What about you, you got a crew already?"
51018,L303837,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?"
51019,L303836,u1493,m101,FELLING,"Hey, Lowell."
51020,L303835,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Debbie...
51021,L304471,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"""Mike?"""
51022,L304470,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,Mike... Mike... Mike...
51023,L304290,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,"Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS."
51024,L304289,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,How grave?
51025,L304288,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,"If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk."
51026,L304267,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,Are you sure?
51027,L304266,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"No, no, we're fine..."
51028,L304265,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
51029,L304293,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,"You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen."
51030,L304292,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
51031,L304286,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Is this ""Alice in Wonderland""?"
51032,L304285,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,"They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller."
51033,L304284,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Come again?
51034,L304283,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,"Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage."
51035,L304282,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, as a ""standard""... I'll hang with ""is the guy telling the truth?"""
51036,L304281,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,"Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else..."
51037,L304280,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"His ""veracity"" was good enough for the State of Mississippi."
51038,L304279,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,"And, I'm told there are questions as to our ""star witness'"" veracity."
51039,L304278,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him..."
51040,L304277,u1494,m101,HELEN CAPERELLI,I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
51041,L304276,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"What does that mean? ""Rife with -- ?"""
51042,L304586,u1495,m101,JIM COOPER,Call me back in ten.
51043,L304585,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview."
51044,L304584,u1495,m101,JIM COOPER,"Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know..."
51045,L304583,u1499,m101,LOWELL,How prominent? What kind of placement?
51046,L304434,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Catch you later.
51047,L304433,u1495,m101,JIM COOPER,"Hi, baby."

51049,L304430,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"How are you, Jim?"
51050,L304429,u1495,m101,JIM COOPER,"Hey, Lowell."
51051,L304606,u1496,m101,JIM COOPER'S VOICE,"No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?"
51052,L304605,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Did I tell you you were wrong?
51053,L304604,u1496,m101,JIM COOPER'S VOICE,Lowell?
51054,L304603,u1496,m101,JIM COOPER'S VOICE,Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
51055,L304602,u1499,m101,LOWELL,You ready...?
51056,L304601,u1496,m101,JIM COOPER'S VOICE,"Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man."
51057,L304600,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Why?
51058,L304599,u1496,m101,JIM COOPER'S VOICE,You're sure you want to do this?
51059,L304598,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yeah?
51060,L304597,u1496,m101,JIM COOPER'S VOICE,Okay.  Lowell?
51061,L304596,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
51062,L304579,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Jim, it's Lowell."
51063,L304578,u1496,m101,JIM COOPER'S VOICE,Hello?
51064,L304201,u1497,m101,LIANE,Yes... Jeffrey.
51065,L304200,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Can we talk about this when I get back?
51066,L304199,u1497,m101,LIANE,"I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry..."
51067,L304197,u1497,m101,LIANE,That's for food.
51068,L304196,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What's the difference...
51069,L304195,u1497,m101,LIANE,Use the bathroom.
51070,L304194,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Where should I wash them?
51071,L304193,u1497,m101,LIANE,Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
51072,L304142,u1497,m101,LIANE,An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
51073,L304141,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I'm doing an interview.
51074,L304140,u1497,m101,LIANE,...taping?  What are you taping?
51075,L304120,u1497,m101,LIANE,"I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the ""F"" up, they were going to kill you..."
51076,L304119,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What's going on?
51077,L303732,u1497,m101,LIANE,"No, thank you."
51078,L303731,u1510,m101,WIGAND,There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
51079,L303730,u1497,m101,LIANE,What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
51080,L303729,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Thomas Sandefur...
51081,L303728,u1497,m101,LIANE,Why? Who said?
51082,L303727,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
51083,L303726,u1497,m101,LIANE,I don't understand.
51084,L303725,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I didn't want to leave it there...
51085,L303724,u1497,m101,LIANE,Why did you take your stuff from the office?
51086,L303723,u1510,m101,WIGAND,That's my stuff from the office...
51087,L303722,u1497,m101,LIANE,Right now?
51088,L303721,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Soy sauce...
51089,L303720,u1497,m101,LIANE,What do you need at the store?
51090,L303719,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I'm going to the store. You need anything?
51091,L303718,u1497,m101,LIANE,"Uh, what are those boxes?"
51092,L303717,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Try the car.
51093,L303716,u1497,m101,LIANE,"I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?"
51094,L303709,u1497,m101,LIANE,"Yes, it's on the stove..."
51095,L303708,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Is there any more rice...?
51096,L303707,u1497,m101,LIANE,Don't you have to be at the office?
51097,L303706,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I can take her.
51098,L303793,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yes.
51099,L303792,u1498,m101,LIANE'S VOICE,"""60 Minutes,"" the television show?"
51100,L303791,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yeah.
51101,L303790,u1498,m101,LIANE'S VOICE,"""60 Minutes""?"
51102,L303789,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with ""60 Minutes""..."
51103,L303788,u1498,m101,LIANE'S VOICE,Did you say Berman?
51104,L303787,u1499,m101,LOWELL,My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
51105,L303786,u1498,m101,LIANE'S VOICE,Who's calling?
51106,L303785,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Thank you, Bob."
51107,L304545,u1505,m101,SHARON,You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
51108,L304544,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures."
51109,L304543,u1505,m101,SHARON,"No, you do not."
51110,L304542,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I got perspective.
51111,L304541,u1505,m101,SHARON,"Get some perspective, Lowell."
51112,L304540,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
51113,L304539,u1505,m101,SHARON,"So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else."
51114,L304538,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"""I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'"" You know, you take the ""60 Minutes"" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? ""60 Minutes""? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it."
51115,L304342,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Jeffrey...
51116,L304341,u1505,m101,SHARON,Jeffrey Wigand...
51117,L304340,u1505,m101,SHARON,"Oh, baby..."
51118,L304339,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I'm alone on this...
51119,L304338,u1505,m101,SHARON,What are you and Mike going to do?
51120,L304337,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone."
51121,L304336,u1505,m101,SHARON,What?!
51122,L304335,u1499,m101,LOWELL,They're killing the Wigand interview...
51123,L304334,u1505,m101,SHARON,What's wrong?
51124,L303778,u1505,m101,SHARON,I have to take a shower.
51125,L303777,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"...it's anonymous. References to ""P.M.""  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?"
51126,L303776,u1505,m101,SHARON,...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
51127,L303775,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"...""ignition propensity?""  ...you understand any of this...?"
51128,L303774,u1505,m101,SHARON,Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
51129,L303773,u1505,m101,SHARON,I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
51130,L303772,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times."
51131,L303770,u1505,m101,SHARON,Hello? Yeah...
51132,L303769,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Will independent sources corroborate that?
51133,L303765,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
51134,L303764,u1505,m101,SHARON,No classes this morning?
51135,L303761,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Let me call you back...
51136,L303760,u1505,m101,SHARON,It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
51137,L303759,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, someone took a poll? ""Are all things Canadian boring...?"""
51138,L304389,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!"
51139,L304388,u1511,m101,WIGAND'S VOICE,You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
51140,L304387,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, my God."
51141,L303980,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?"
51142,L303979,u1511,m101,WIGAND'S VOICE,Is it too late?
51143,L303874,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Who is this?
51144,L303873,u1511,m101,WIGAND'S VOICE,...you fucked me!
51145,L303872,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yeah...
51146,L304557,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,All right. See you...
51147,L304556,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick..."
51148,L304555,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
51149,L304553,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
51150,L304552,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Yeah, I'm here."
51151,L304073,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Okay. Thank you.
51152,L304072,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,Alright?
51153,L304071,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yeah.
51154,L304070,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,It would be better if he called us.
51155,L304069,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?"
51156,L304068,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,"Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do..."
51157,L304067,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point."
51158,L304066,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,"Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?"
51159,L304062,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection."
51160,L304061,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,"What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?"
51161,L304060,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there."
51162,L304059,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,That's right...
51163,L304058,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?"
51164,L304054,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,I'll call you then.
51165,L304053,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Area code 212-555-0199.
51166,L304052,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,Alright.
51167,L304051,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?"
51168,L304659,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
51169,L304658,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end..."
51170,L304655,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Everything interests me.
51171,L304654,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,That Canada story? Still interest you?
51172,L304624,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
51173,L304623,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Mike... in my...
51174,L304621,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? ""In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?""  What ""future""? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone."
51175,L304620,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?"
51176,L304619,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations..."
51177,L304618,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?"
51178,L304617,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Give me a break!
51179,L304616,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, please, Mike..."
51180,L304615,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way."
51181,L304614,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver."
51182,L304613,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
51183,L304612,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?"
51184,L304611,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"Yeah, that's right."
51185,L304610,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, lots."
51186,L304609,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?"
51187,L304608,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face."
51188,L304607,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Did I get you up?
51189,L304503,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I think it was a disgrace.
51190,L304502,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Alright. What did you think?
51191,L304501,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I disappeared on you?
51192,L304500,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
51193,L304499,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yeah.
51194,L304464,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is ""no."" I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made."
51195,L304463,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
51196,L304462,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
51197,L304461,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
51198,L304333,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,I'm with Don on this.
51199,L304332,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What?
51200,L304331,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Lowell!
51201,L304330,u1499,m101,LOWELL,These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
51202,L304329,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Lowell.
51203,L304328,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"""Put the corporation at risk""...? Give me a fucking break!"
51204,L304327,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Lowell.
51205,L304314,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,What?
51206,L304313,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
51207,L304271,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
51208,L304270,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it."
51209,L304256,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Good.
51210,L304255,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"It went great in Mississippi, Mike."
51211,L304147,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?"
51212,L304146,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Who are these people?
51213,L304145,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, man."
51214,L304139,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal..."
51215,L304138,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order..."
51216,L304137,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Thank you for saying that...
51217,L304135,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,How are the rooms? Comfortable?
51218,L304134,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"So, is everything okay?"
51219,L303944,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"Oh, torture? Great ratings."
51220,L303943,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were ""compelled""?"
51221,L303942,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,What do you mean?
51222,L303941,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way..."
51223,L303928,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What's this?
51224,L303927,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,No shit.
51225,L303926,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Hardly new news.
51226,L303925,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"Well, it isn't ""cigarettes are bad for you""..."
51227,L303924,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?"
51228,L303923,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"What ""Seven Dwarfs?"""
51229,L303922,u1499,m101,LOWELL,He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
51230,L303834,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
51231,L303833,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yeah.
51232,L303832,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,You eating with us?
51233,L303831,u1499,m101,LOWELL,...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
51234,L303748,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?"
51235,L303747,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language."
51236,L303746,u1499,m101,LOWELL,We're there.
51237,L303675,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but..."
51238,L303674,u1507,m101,THE SHEIKH,Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
51239,L303672,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No. We don't do that.  You've seen ""60 Minutes"" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America."
51240,L303671,u1507,m101,THE SHEIKH,Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
51241,L303670,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why."
51242,L303669,u1507,m101,THE SHEIKH,"Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?"
51243,L303668,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What I've seen... I've liked.
51244,L303667,u1507,m101,THE SHEIKH,How have you liked your stay?
51245,L303666,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yeah... Thank you.
51246,L303665,u1507,m101,THE SHEIKH,Coffee?
51247,L304537,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Yeah. Yeah, I will."
51248,L304536,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You try and have a good time.
51249,L304535,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
51250,L304534,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Where are you, anyway?"
51251,L304531,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them."
51252,L304530,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
51253,L304529,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
51254,L304528,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"""Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know."" Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around."
51255,L304527,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?"
51256,L304526,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You greased the rails!
51257,L304525,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"That's bullshit, Jeff!"
51258,L304524,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You manipulated me into this...!
51259,L304410,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!"
51260,L304409,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
51261,L304408,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I told the truth... I told the truth.
51262,L304407,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?"
51263,L304406,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
51264,L304405,u1499,m101,LOWELL,That's not the point.
51265,L304404,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What does this have to do with my testimony?
51266,L304403,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?"
51267,L304402,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?"
51268,L304401,u1499,m101,LOWELL,ABC Telemarketing Company.
51269,L304400,u1510,m101,WIGAND,ABC...?
51270,L304399,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
51271,L304398,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?"
51272,L304397,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
51273,L304396,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What?
51274,L304395,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
51275,L304394,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?"
51276,L304393,u1499,m101,LOWELL,She sued you for back payments of child support?
51277,L304392,u1510,m101,WIGAND,...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
51278,L304391,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me."
51279,L304390,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I told the truth!
51280,L304386,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!"
51281,L304385,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?"
51282,L304355,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"I do not think that you ""know"" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day."
51283,L304354,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No? No, what?"
51284,L304353,u1510,m101,WIGAND,No.
51285,L304352,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how..."
51286,L304351,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What?!
51287,L304350,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it."
51288,L304253,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Run that Sandefur piece on ""nicotine's not addictive."" Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with ""I believe they perjured..."" Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word ""felt"" on the B-side..."
51289,L304252,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"""Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."""
51290,L304228,u1510,m101,WIGAND,No. I mean since whenever...
51291,L304227,u1499,m101,LOWELL,You mean... since this morning?
51292,L304226,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What's changed?
51293,L304222,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I don't know what to do.
51294,L304221,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
51295,L304220,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Yeah, great."
51296,L304219,u1499,m101,LOWELL,You attract a crowd.
51297,L304189,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Did you have a good day?
51298,L304188,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
51299,L304187,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
51300,L304186,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I heard.
51301,L304185,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
51302,L304182,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"...they ""volunteered."" A friend owns a large security company."
51303,L304181,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Lowell, I can't afford --"
51304,L304144,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that..."
51305,L304143,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?"
51306,L304100,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"I'll call them, Lowell."
51307,L304099,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Good. But Jeff...
51308,L304096,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it."
51309,L304095,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Jeff...
51310,L304094,u1510,m101,WIGAND,They do this with impunity!
51311,L304093,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Jeff, call the FBI right away..."
51312,L304090,u1510,m101,WIGAND,They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
51313,L304089,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Excuse me. Yeah...
51314,L304036,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action."
51315,L304035,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!"
51316,L304034,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or ""60 Minutes'"" with this cheap skepticism!"
51317,L304033,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I don't think you really understand --
51318,L304032,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
51319,L304031,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!"
51320,L304030,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Yes.
51321,L304029,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
51322,L304028,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I believe that? Yes, I believe that."
51323,L304027,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You believe that?
51324,L304026,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have."
51325,L304025,u1510,m101,WIGAND,No.
51326,L304024,u1499,m101,LOWELL,You believe that?
51327,L304022,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important."
51328,L304021,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials..."
51329,L304020,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
51330,L304019,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
51331,L304018,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?"
51332,L304017,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Why?
51333,L304016,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on ""60 Minutes,"" I got to know everything about why you got fired."
51334,L304015,u1510,m101,WIGAND,My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
51335,L304014,u1499,m101,LOWELL,You charge by the hour?
51336,L304013,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
51337,L304012,u1499,m101,LOWELL,My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
51338,L304011,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Next to your father?
51339,L304010,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally."
51340,L304009,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?"
51341,L304008,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Tempura...
51342,L304007,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What did you get us?
51343,L304004,u1499,m101,LOWELL,It's okay.
51344,L304003,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up."
51345,L304002,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Hello. You there
51346,L304001,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"It's obvious, isn't it?"
51347,L304000,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"How'd you know that, Lowell?"
51348,L303999,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
51349,L303998,u1510,m101,WIGAND,...okay.
51350,L303997,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car."
51351,L303996,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?"
51352,L303985,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Good.  You have kids?
51353,L303984,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?"
51354,L303982,u1499,m101,LOWELL,You okay?
51355,L303981,u1510,m101,WIGAND,The new place? New.
51356,L303919,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff."
51357,L303918,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
51358,L303916,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?"
51359,L303915,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for ""tobacco"" in the first place?"
51360,L303914,u1510,m101,WIGAND,It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
51361,L303913,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease..."
51362,L303912,u1510,m101,WIGAND,The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
51363,L303911,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Seven dwarfs?
51364,L303908,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
51365,L303907,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the ""zone""...?"
51366,L303906,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
51367,L303905,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Like what?
51368,L303904,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
51369,L303903,u1510,m101,WIGAND,They should be.
51370,L303902,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"They're afraid of you, aren't they?"
51371,L303901,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it."
51372,L303897,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people."
51373,L303896,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You came all the way down here to tell me that?
51374,L303895,u1499,m101,LOWELL,And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
51375,L303894,u1510,m101,WIGAND,It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
51376,L303893,u1499,m101,LOWELL,How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
51377,L303892,u1510,m101,WIGAND,How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
51378,L303891,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Why am I gonna mention your name?
51379,L303890,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?"
51380,L303889,u1499,m101,LOWELL,To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
51381,L303888,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?"
51382,L303887,u1499,m101,LOWELL,I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
51383,L303886,u1510,m101,WIGAND,What do...
51384,L303885,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Good. I want to talk to you.
51385,L303884,u1499,m101,LOWELL,C'mere. I want to talk to you.
51386,L303883,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?"
51387,L303882,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Jump in, quick, c'mon..."
51388,L303881,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?"
51389,L303877,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Fuck you, too!"
51390,L303876,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What are you talking about? Where are you?
51391,L303875,u1510,m101,WIGAND,...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
51392,L303827,u1499,m101,LOWELL,If you want to do it.
51393,L303826,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Should I just take the documents now?
51394,L303825,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand."
51395,L303824,u1510,m101,WIGAND,How much would I get paid?
51396,L303823,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Did work.
51397,L303822,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Did work.
51398,L303821,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?"
51399,L303820,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?"
51400,L303818,u1510,m101,WIGAND,This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
51401,L303817,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Far as you go where?
51402,L303816,u1510,m101,WIGAND,...but that's as far as I go...
51403,L303812,u1510,m101,WIGAND,How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
51404,L303811,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way."
51405,L303810,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I know what I have to know.
51406,L303809,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Like what? Your sign?
51407,L303808,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?"
51408,L303807,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Look, I really don't have that much time..."
51409,L303806,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Black, black..."
51410,L303805,u1499,m101,LOWELL,How do you like your coffee? Black?
51411,L303803,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please."
51412,L303802,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Who's that?
51413,L304522,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!"
51414,L304521,u1506,m101,THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE,I can't say that!
51415,L304520,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!"
51416,L304519,u1506,m101,THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE,He doesn't seem to be listening...
51417,L304518,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What's happening?!
51418,L304517,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"Hello, can you hear me now?"
51419,L304516,u1506,m101,THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE,What?
51420,L304515,u1499,m101,LOWELL,What about now?
51421,L304514,u1506,m101,THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE,You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
51422,L304513,u1499,m101,LOWELL,Did he hear you?
51423,L304511,u1499,m101,LOWELL,"No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that."
51424,L304510,u1506,m101,THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE,I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
51425,L304349,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?"
51426,L304348,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,Where you staying now?
51427,L304347,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week..."
51428,L304346,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Liane has filed for divorce...
51429,L304345,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,What do you mean there is no family?
51430,L304344,u1510,m101,WIGAND,There is -- there is no family.
51431,L304343,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,"Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?"
51432,L304098,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
51433,L304097,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,"I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record."
51434,L304092,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
51435,L304091,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,What are you talking about?
51436,L303995,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,You called me.
51437,L303994,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?"
51438,L303992,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
51439,L303991,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,"Well, what do you really think, though?"
51440,L303990,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game."
51441,L303989,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
51442,L303988,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property..."
51443,L303987,u1510,m101,WIGAND,She's okay.
51444,L303986,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,"We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?"
51445,L303910,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs..."
51446,L303909,u1500,m101,LOWELL'S VOICE,Just give me an example...
51447,L304210,u1501,m101,MICHAEL MOORE,"Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?"
51448,L304209,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,"Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order..."
51449,L304208,u1501,m101,MICHAEL MOORE,Right.
51450,L304207,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,"Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today."
51451,L304206,u1501,m101,MICHAEL MOORE,"Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand."
51452,L304205,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,"Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore."
51453,L304647,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"""There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..."" ""I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."""
51454,L304646,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"""You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"""
51455,L304498,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"""The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."""
51456,L304497,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"""I would bet on it."""
51457,L304166,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it."
51458,L304165,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
51459,L304164,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Poor communication skills.
51460,L304163,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?"
51461,L304162,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Most certainly.
51462,L304161,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously..."
51463,L304160,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision."
51464,L304159,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
51465,L304158,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called ""coumarin."" When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen..."
51466,L304157,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"The process is known as ""impact boosting..."" While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as ""ammonia chemistry."" It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system."
51467,L304156,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia..."
51468,L304155,u1510,m101,WIGAND,You're gonna get your fix...
51469,L304154,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,"A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix..."
51470,L304153,u1510,m101,WIGAND,A delivery device for nicotine.
51471,L304152,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,And that's what cigarettes are for...?
51472,L304151,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business."
51473,L304150,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
51474,L304149,u1510,m101,WIGAND,...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
51475,L304148,u1502,m101,MIKE WALLACE,You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?

This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face!

I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here..."
51478,L304247,u1503,m101,MOTLEY,There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
51479,L304246,u1509,m101,TOBACCO LAWYER,Object!
51480,L304245,u1503,m101,MOTLEY,It acts as a...

51486,L304213,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Jail?
51487,L304176,u1510,m101,WIGAND,When should we do this?
51488,L304175,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,"My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you..."
51489,L304174,u1510,m101,WIGAND,"Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call..."
51490,L304173,u1504,m101,RICHARD SCRUGGS,Hello.
51491,L303863,u1508,m101,THOMAS SANDEFUR,"I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you."
51492,L303862,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
51493,L303861,u1508,m101,THOMAS SANDEFUR,That's why we hire scientists...

51497,L303857,u1508,m101,THOMAS SANDEFUR,"...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters..."
51498,L303856,u1510,m101,WIGAND,Is that a threat?
51499,L303855,u1508,m101,THOMAS SANDEFUR,"Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence..."

Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff..."
51502,L303852,u1510,m101,WIGAND,I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
51503,L303851,u1508,m101,THOMAS SANDEFUR,"And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate."

51508,L306525,u1520,m102,MILES,"Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --"
51509,L306524,u1512,m102,BONNIE,He --
51510,L306523,u1520,m102,MILES,"Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --"
51511,L306522,u1512,m102,BONNIE,"Well, I wouldn't say --"
51512,L306521,u1520,m102,MILES,"Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --"
51513,L306590,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,We'd better go before we get thrown out.
51514,L306589,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"Course I can't do much ""wriggling"" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl."
51515,L306576,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"She said ""penetrate."" Heh heh heh."
51516,L306575,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
51517,L306574,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried."
51518,L306573,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
51519,L306572,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"You did good, Massey!"
51520,L306571,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court."
51521,L306567,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Howard!
51522,L306566,u1513,m102,DOYLE,Baby. You are so HOT!
51523,L306563,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
51524,L306562,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --"
51525,L306561,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to..."
51526,L306558,u1513,m102,DOYLE,Here. Got pictures.
51527,L306557,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
51528,L306554,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry."
51529,L306553,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?"
51530,L306546,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?"
51531,L306545,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil."
51532,L306594,u1513,m102,DOYLE,Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
51533,L306593,u1520,m102,MILES,I'd just like to have a word with her.
51534,L306592,u1513,m102,DOYLE,What part?
51535,L306591,u1520,m102,MILES,"Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment."
51536,L306586,u1520,m102,MILES,-- and we are sure...
51537,L306585,u1513,m102,DOYLE,A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
51538,L306584,u1520,m102,MILES,"And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room."
51539,L306583,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"Well -- at the moment, that'd be me."
51540,L306582,u1520,m102,MILES,"-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party."
51541,L306581,u1520,m102,MILES,I just want to make sure that you both --
51542,L306580,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!"
51543,L306569,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs."
51544,L306568,u1520,m102,MILES,What a touching story.
51545,L306565,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"I had no idea until after, but --"
51546,L306564,u1520,m102,MILES,No!
51547,L306560,u1513,m102,DOYLE,Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
51548,L306559,u1520,m102,MILES,I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
51549,L306556,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend."
51550,L306555,u1520,m102,MILES,"Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?"
51551,L306552,u1513,m102,DOYLE,She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
51552,L306551,u1520,m102,MILES,"So she's uh, flourishing?"
51553,L306550,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a ""nurse,"" takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop."
51554,L306549,u1520,m102,MILES,And how is Mrs. Reiser?
51555,L306548,u1513,m102,DOYLE,"After you, Doll."
51556,L306547,u1520,m102,MILES,Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
51557,L307027,u1520,m102,MILES,"Mr. Dumbarton is, yes."
51558,L307026,u1514,m102,GANGSTER,You're in a rush.
51559,L307024,u1520,m102,MILES,Here's her picture...
51560,L307023,u1514,m102,GANGSTER,Is that... one person?
51561,L307022,u1520,m102,MILES,"Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey."
51562,L307021,u1514,m102,GANGSTER,Who do you want me to kill?
51563,L307020,u1520,m102,MILES,Excuse me?
51564,L307019,u1514,m102,GANGSTER,Who's the pigeon?
51565,L307018,u1520,m102,MILES,"I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy."
51566,L307100,u1515,m102,JOE,Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
51567,L307099,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical."
51568,L307096,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand."
51569,L307095,u1515,m102,JOE,Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
51570,L307092,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?"
51571,L307091,u1515,m102,JOE,You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
51572,L307078,u1515,m102,JOE,Who's the pigeon?
51573,L307077,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Triple!
51574,L307076,u1515,m102,JOE,That's his lawyer.
51575,L307075,u1515,m102,JOE,No...
51576,L307074,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
51577,L307073,u1515,m102,JOE,Mr. Dumbarton.
51578,L307072,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Whoever sent you, I'll pay double."
51579,L306475,u1516,m102,JUDGE,Sustained.
51580,L306474,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations."
51581,L306450,u1516,m102,JUDGE,Mr. Massey?
51582,L306449,u1524,m102,RUTH,"We rest, Your Honor."
51583,L306448,u1516,m102,JUDGE,"Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow."
51584,L306436,u1524,m102,RUTH,Uh... poetry recitation.
51585,L306435,u1516,m102,JUDGE,Grounds?
51586,L306434,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Objection, your honor!"
51587,L307059,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"I don't know, but don't call me Marylin."
51588,L307058,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin! What have I done?
51589,L307057,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Huh?
51590,L307056,u1520,m102,MILES,"That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?"
51591,L307055,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Who was that?
51592,L307052,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"So, that's good, right?"
51593,L307051,u1520,m102,MILES,She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
51594,L307049,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Yes.
51595,L307048,u1520,m102,MILES,Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
51596,L307047,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?"
51597,L307046,u1520,m102,MILES,Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
51598,L307045,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"What do you mean, was."
51599,L307044,u1520,m102,MILES,He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
51600,L307043,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Yes?
51601,L307042,u1520,m102,MILES,That was Marvin Untermeyer.
51602,L307041,u1517,m102,KENNETH,What?
51603,L307040,u1520,m102,MILES,My God.
51604,L306947,u1520,m102,MILES,"I already made my move, Kenneth."
51605,L306946,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"It's your move, Miles."
51606,L306945,u1520,m102,MILES,They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
51607,L306796,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
51608,L306795,u1520,m102,MILES,No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
51609,L306794,u1517,m102,KENNETH,No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
51610,L306793,u1520,m102,MILES,You have the pre-nup?
51611,L306792,u1517,m102,KENNETH,I have it.
51612,L306786,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Well... I'm still...
51613,L306785,u1520,m102,MILES,Asian? No.
51614,L306784,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Is she Asian?
51615,L306783,u1520,m102,MILES,"Thanks, buddy."
51616,L306782,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"I'm happy for you, pal."
51617,L306620,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either."
51618,L306619,u1520,m102,MILES,He's the wrong man.
51619,L306618,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
51620,L306617,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
51621,L306616,u1517,m102,KENNETH,What?
51622,L306615,u1520,m102,MILES,"She can't really love that idiot, can she?"
51623,L306614,u1517,m102,KENNETH,The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
51624,L306613,u1520,m102,MILES,What?
51625,L306612,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
51626,L306611,u1520,m102,MILES,Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
51627,L306610,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Got any symptoms?
51628,L306609,u1520,m102,MILES,"Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?"
51629,L306520,u1520,m102,MILES,I should be in therapy.
51630,L306519,u1517,m102,KENNETH,You're in check.
51631,L306518,u1520,m102,MILES,Denial is not a river in Egypt.
51632,L306517,u1517,m102,KENNETH,I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
51633,L306516,u1520,m102,MILES,You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
51634,L306515,u1517,m102,KENNETH,We did not.
51635,L306514,u1520,m102,MILES,Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
51636,L306513,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Set one side for Bel Air.
51637,L306512,u1520,m102,MILES,It was a gift from a client.
51638,L306511,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
51639,L306510,u1520,m102,MILES,"It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones."
51640,L306509,u1517,m102,KENNETH,No frown lines.  New watch?
51641,L306508,u1520,m102,MILES,Why in God's name would I want...?
51642,L306507,u1517,m102,KENNETH,"It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them..."
51643,L306506,u1520,m102,MILES,What the hell is Botox?
51644,L306505,u1517,m102,KENNETH,You want Botox?
51645,L306504,u1520,m102,MILES,I don't need it.
51646,L306503,u1517,m102,KENNETH,Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
51647,L306502,u1520,m102,MILES,"Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need."
51648,L306501,u1517,m102,KENNETH,So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
51649,L306500,u1520,m102,MILES,She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
51650,L306277,u1527,m102,WITNESS,He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
51651,L306276,u1518,m102,LAWYER,What is your husband's profession?
51652,L306275,u1527,m102,WITNESS,I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
51653,L306274,u1518,m102,LAWYER,"Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?"
51654,L306273,u1527,m102,WITNESS,"Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea."
51655,L306272,u1518,m102,LAWYER,"Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --"
51656,L306954,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'll be right back.
51657,L306953,u1522,m102,RAMONA,It sounded like a bell.
51658,L306889,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Yeah. I guess. You know --
51659,L306888,u1522,m102,RAMONA,Oh boy. If he only knew.
51660,L306887,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Well. He said to ""make the house mine."""
51661,L306879,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
51662,L306878,u1522,m102,RAMONA,Is Tong older than Ming?
51663,L306875,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I said yes.
51664,L306874,u1522,m102,RAMONA,You said 'yes' didn't you?
51665,L306838,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,It's about time.
51666,L306837,u1522,m102,RAMONA,You're vulnerable.
51667,L306497,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub."
51668,L306496,u1522,m102,RAMONA,I begged you to have a baby!
51669,L306488,u1522,m102,RAMONA,Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
51670,L306487,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
51671,L306486,u1522,m102,RAMONA,Why do you think she did it?
51672,L306485,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her."
51673,L306262,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
51674,L306261,u1522,m102,RAMONA,You like kids.
51675,L306260,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,No.
51676,L306259,u1522,m102,RAMONA,You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
51677,L306242,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Ruth Rabino.
51678,L306241,u1522,m102,RAMONA,So who'd you hire?
51679,L307150,u1520,m102,MILES,I thought so.
51680,L307149,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Sweet.
51681,L307145,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked ""what was my daddy like?"""
51682,L307144,u1520,m102,MILES,Pre-Castro.
51683,L307132,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
51684,L307131,u1520,m102,MILES,Murder!
51685,L307130,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Murder?
51686,L307129,u1520,m102,MILES,Income tax evasion?
51687,L307128,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Forgery? Fraud?
51688,L307127,u1520,m102,MILES,You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
51689,L307126,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
51690,L307125,u1520,m102,MILES,"You wounded me first, Marylin."
51691,L307116,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
51692,L307115,u1520,m102,MILES,But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
51693,L307114,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,It's not something I wanted either.
51694,L307113,u1520,m102,MILES,Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
51695,L307112,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Hello Miles.
51696,L307111,u1520,m102,MILES,Hello Marylin.
51697,L307106,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
51698,L307105,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
51699,L307094,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,That's true.
51700,L307093,u1520,m102,MILES,Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
51701,L307090,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
51702,L307089,u1520,m102,MILES,You were going to have this thug...?
51703,L307088,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Now. But first, he worked for you."
51704,L307087,u1520,m102,MILES,Wait! He works for YOU?
51705,L307086,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,It's okay Joe.
51706,L307085,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin!
51707,L307084,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"It's a no go, Joe."
51708,L307071,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You do? You do love me?
51709,L307070,u1520,m102,MILES,So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
51710,L307069,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I fell in love Miles.
51711,L307068,u1520,m102,MILES,Please! Leave the house.
51712,L307067,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to..."
51713,L307066,u1520,m102,MILES,No buts. Now. Out.
51714,L307065,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --"
51715,L307064,u1520,m102,MILES,You have to leave the house immediately!
51716,L307063,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
51717,L307062,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin?
51718,L307061,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Hello?
51719,L306999,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,That's marriage.
51720,L306998,u1520,m102,MILES,That's blackmail.
51721,L306997,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
51722,L306996,u1520,m102,MILES,Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
51723,L306995,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
51724,L306994,u1520,m102,MILES,Meaning my house.
51725,L306993,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house."
51726,L306992,u1520,m102,MILES,"You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional."
51727,L306991,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?"
51728,L306990,u1520,m102,MILES,You can't prove anything.
51729,L306989,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?"
51730,L306988,u1520,m102,MILES,Those are gifts.
51731,L306987,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients."
51732,L306986,u1520,m102,MILES,"What kind of ""stuff?"""
51733,L306985,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,STUFF.  Got a light?
51734,L306984,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --"
51735,L306983,u1520,m102,MILES,"I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend."
51736,L306982,u1520,m102,MILES,The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
51737,L306981,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'm reporting you to the IRS.
51738,L306980,u1520,m102,MILES,"Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail."
51739,L306979,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I want to nail you ass.
51740,L306978,u1520,m102,MILES,What do you want?
51741,L306977,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Comfy!
51742,L306976,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine."
51743,L306975,u1520,m102,MILES,"I don't believe you have ""things."""
51744,L306974,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
51745,L306973,u1520,m102,MILES,"I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with ""the criminal mind."""
51746,L306972,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,May I come in?
51747,L306971,u1520,m102,MILES,Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
51748,L306938,u1520,m102,MILES,"I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU."
51749,L306937,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles? You're scaring me.
51750,L306936,u1520,m102,MILES,Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
51751,L306935,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
51752,L306934,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
51753,L306933,u1520,m102,MILES,I love you. I want to have your baby.
51754,L306932,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You don't like me?
51755,L306929,u1520,m102,MILES,I bet.
51756,L306928,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I have a surprise for you.
51757,L306927,u1520,m102,MILES,Hello Marylin.
51758,L306926,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Hi.
51759,L306872,u1520,m102,MILES,"I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --"
51760,L306871,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles.
51761,L306870,u1520,m102,MILES,Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
51762,L306869,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Fabric and fringe.
51763,L306868,u1520,m102,MILES,Good.  Are those foods?
51764,L306867,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Well, I suppose I could ""girly"" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --"
51765,L306866,u1520,m102,MILES,Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
51766,L306865,u1520,m102,MILES,"I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous ""Guy"" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house."
51767,L306864,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Hardly. You have six bedrooms
51768,L306863,u1520,m102,MILES,"In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad."
51769,L306862,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Honey, I could sit..."
51770,L306861,u1520,m102,MILES,"No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a ""married couch."""
51771,L306860,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
51772,L306834,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted."
51773,L306833,u1520,m102,MILES,But?
51774,L306830,u1520,m102,MILES,"What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected."
51775,L306829,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Oh Miles!
51776,L306828,u1520,m102,MILES,"No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage."
51777,L306816,u1520,m102,MILES,"Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always."
51778,L306815,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
51779,L306780,u1520,m102,MILES,I have a watch.
51780,L306779,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I know.
51781,L306778,u1520,m102,MILES,I don't have a ring!
51782,L306777,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Yes. Again.
51783,L306776,u1520,m102,MILES,"No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?"
51784,L306775,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Do you want to sleep on it?
51785,L306774,u1520,m102,MILES,No.
51786,L306773,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Do you want me to sleep on it?
51787,L306772,u1520,m102,MILES,You do?
51788,L306771,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Yes, Miles. I accept."
51789,L306770,u1520,m102,MILES,"Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?"
51790,L306769,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Yes.
51791,L306768,u1520,m102,MILES,"Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do."
51792,L306767,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Did you just propose to me?
51793,L306766,u1520,m102,MILES,No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
51794,L306765,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Huh?
51795,L306764,u1520,m102,MILES,I want to be your -- your wife.
51796,L306763,u1520,m102,MILES,I want... I want to...
51797,L306762,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,What is it Miles?
51798,L306761,u1520,m102,MILES,And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
51799,L306760,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
51800,L306759,u1520,m102,MILES,I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
51801,L306758,u1520,m102,MILES,Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
51802,L306757,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Friends?
51803,L306756,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
51804,L306755,u1520,m102,MILES,No.
51805,L306754,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
51806,L306753,u1520,m102,MILES,"That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us."
51807,L306752,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something ""off"" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our ""deficiencies"" very early on. Maybe..."
51808,L306751,u1520,m102,MILES,"No, we're not!"
51809,L306750,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,We're damaged goods.
51810,L306749,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Oh right. You met Patricia.
51811,L306748,u1520,m102,MILES,Your mother was.
51812,L306747,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,And here I thought my mother was...
51813,L306746,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Boy. Boy, oh boy."
51814,L306745,u1520,m102,MILES,Apparently she was very disappointed.
51815,L306744,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,She held that against you?
51816,L306743,u1520,m102,MILES,"No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her ""type."" She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --"
51817,L306742,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,She didn't love you?
51818,L306741,u1520,m102,MILES,She never particularly cared for me.
51819,L306740,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
51820,L306739,u1520,m102,MILES,Hmmm...
51821,L306738,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
51822,L306737,u1520,m102,MILES,Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
51823,L306736,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Oh. And that is -- mom?
51824,L306735,u1520,m102,MILES,Me. Yes.
51825,L306734,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Is that you?
51826,L306733,u1520,m102,MILES,Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
51827,L306732,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
51828,L306731,u1520,m102,MILES,No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
51829,L306730,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,From a -- girlfriend.
51830,L306729,u1520,m102,MILES,"Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift."
51831,L306728,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
51832,L306727,u1520,m102,MILES,Thank you.
51833,L306726,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting."
51834,L306724,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Okay Miles.
51835,L306723,u1520,m102,MILES,No. Don't stop.
51836,L306722,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
51837,L306721,u1520,m102,MILES,I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
51838,L306720,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
51839,L306719,u1520,m102,MILES,You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
51840,L306718,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!"
51841,L306717,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
51842,L306716,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Screw you, asswipe!"
51843,L306715,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!"
51844,L306714,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin? When did I say...?
51845,L306713,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
51846,L306712,u1520,m102,MILES,Yes? Marylin?
51847,L306711,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles?
51848,L306710,u1520,m102,MILES,Hello?
51849,L306697,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
51850,L306696,u1520,m102,MILES,"No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --"
51851,L306695,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
51852,L306694,u1520,m102,MILES,"More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery."
51853,L306693,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman..."
51854,L306692,u1520,m102,MILES,To victory.
51855,L306664,u1520,m102,MILES,Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
51856,L306663,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
51857,L306662,u1520,m102,MILES,I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
51858,L306661,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Have you tried the duck?
51859,L306660,u1520,m102,MILES,"Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?"
51860,L306659,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles."
51861,L306658,u1520,m102,MILES,"I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea."
51862,L306657,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles. Miles. Miles.
51863,L306656,u1520,m102,MILES,Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
51864,L306655,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Howard is a beautiful person.
51865,L306654,u1520,m102,MILES,I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
51866,L306607,u1520,m102,MILES,"No, that's not all."
51867,L306606,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,So I hear. Is that all?
51868,L306605,u1520,m102,MILES,The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
51869,L306604,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
51870,L306603,u1520,m102,MILES,But why him?
51871,L306602,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that."
51872,L306601,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin! Listen to me.
51873,L306600,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
51874,L306599,u1520,m102,MILES,Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
51875,L306598,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,He's passionate.
51876,L306597,u1520,m102,MILES,To him? He's a sick freak.
51877,L306596,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Getting married.
51878,L306588,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Absolutely.
51879,L306587,u1520,m102,MILES,-- we are both sure that's what we want?
51880,L306579,u1520,m102,MILES,"That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law."
51881,L306578,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?"
51882,L306577,u1520,m102,MILES,"Oh, for the love of..."
51883,L306470,u1520,m102,MILES,Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
51884,L306469,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,He'll regret this.
51885,L306445,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
51886,L306444,u1520,m102,MILES,And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
51887,L306442,u1520,m102,MILES,And you've always loved him?
51888,L306441,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Yes. I loved my husband, Rex."
51889,L306419,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Well, don't look at mine!"
51890,L306418,u1520,m102,MILES,"Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount."
51891,L306417,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"What is it you're after, Miles?"
51892,L306416,u1520,m102,MILES,Gotcha.
51893,L306415,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
51894,L306414,u1520,m102,MILES,He wants a reconciliation.
51895,L306413,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?"
51896,L306412,u1520,m102,MILES,No. I haven't. Have you?
51897,L306411,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You just haven't met the right person.
51898,L306410,u1520,m102,MILES,"As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan."
51899,L306409,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You don't believe in it.
51900,L306408,u1520,m102,MILES,No.
51901,L306407,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Have you ever been married, Miles?"
51902,L306406,u1520,m102,MILES,Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
51903,L306405,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
51904,L306404,u1520,m102,MILES,"""Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"""
51905,L306402,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I know you do.
51906,L306401,u1520,m102,MILES,I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
51907,L306400,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I told you. I was hungry.
51908,L306399,u1520,m102,MILES,Why would you be here?
51909,L306398,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,How do you know?
51910,L306397,u1520,m102,MILES,But you don't agree?
51911,L306396,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down."
51912,L306395,u1520,m102,MILES,What does your lawyer think?
51913,L306394,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
51914,L306393,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
51915,L306392,u1520,m102,MILES,Not yet.
51916,L306391,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Did you see the tape?
51917,L306390,u1520,m102,MILES,"Do you have a hard heart, Marylin."
51918,L306388,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"""Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."""
51919,L306387,u1520,m102,MILES,"Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared."
51920,L306386,u1520,m102,MILES,Isn't everything?
51921,L306385,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I assume this is on Rex?
51922,L306340,u1520,m102,MILES,Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
51923,L306339,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,These are yours.
51924,L306317,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?"
51925,L306316,u1520,m102,MILES,How nice.
51926,L306304,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,And you must be Mr. Massey.
51927,L306303,u1520,m102,MILES,"-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth."
51928,L306342,u1523,m102,REX,Sometimes I forget.
51929,L306341,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
51930,L306338,u1523,m102,REX,You have some?
51931,L306337,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Do you need a Tagamet?
51932,L306308,u1523,m102,REX,My whole metabolism is -- off.
51933,L306307,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Are you alright? You lost weight.
51934,L306306,u1523,m102,REX,Marylin.
51935,L306305,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Hello, Rex."
51936,L306201,u1523,m102,REX,Dogs?
51937,L306200,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
51938,L306199,u1523,m102,REX,Marylin?
51939,L306198,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?"
51940,L306197,u1523,m102,REX,"But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life."
51941,L306196,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,We are. And it's winding down.
51942,L306195,u1523,m102,REX,"Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?"
51943,L306194,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Rex. Get away from the door.
51944,L306970,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her."
51945,L306969,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,So. Now what?
51946,L306968,u1524,m102,RUTH,"He was right, wasn't he?"
51947,L306967,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,He never even asked. He just assumed --
51948,L306966,u1524,m102,RUTH,Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
51949,L306965,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
51950,L306964,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything."
51951,L306963,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
51952,L306962,u1524,m102,RUTH,You used his credit card.
51953,L306961,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Forgery and Fraud?
51954,L306462,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Please!
51955,L306461,u1524,m102,RUTH,Is this a lover?
51956,L306454,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Jesus.
51957,L306453,u1524,m102,RUTH,Who's that?
51958,L306429,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth."
51959,L306428,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I was devastated. Of course.
51960,L306344,u1524,m102,RUTH,"We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets."
51961,L306343,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I'm sorry. Where were we?
51962,L306899,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I guess.
51963,L306898,u1525,m102,SARAH,"Soon, you'll have your own rage!"
51964,L306897,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
51965,L306896,u1525,m102,SARAH,"Well, that's about to change big time."
51966,L306895,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
51967,L306894,u1525,m102,SARAH,So what?
51968,L306893,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me."
51969,L306892,u1525,m102,SARAH,But you're going through with it?
51970,L306891,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
51971,L306890,u1525,m102,SARAH,What?
51972,L306884,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Right.
51973,L306883,u1525,m102,SARAH,What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
51974,L306882,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
51975,L306877,u1525,m102,SARAH,It's not Ming. It's Tong.
51976,L306876,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Is this Ming?
51977,L306836,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I want to be exposed.
51978,L306835,u1525,m102,SARAH,"But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed."
51979,L306802,u1525,m102,SARAH,Hello Miles.
51980,L306801,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
51981,L306499,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine."
51982,L306498,u1525,m102,SARAH,You're not...
51983,L306495,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
51984,L306494,u1525,m102,SARAH,"So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?"
51985,L306493,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon."
51986,L306490,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any."
51987,L306489,u1525,m102,SARAH,That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
51988,L306374,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
51989,L306373,u1525,m102,SARAH,Shit.
51990,L306372,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court."
51991,L306371,u1525,m102,SARAH,So where are you now?
51992,L306370,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination."
51993,L306369,u1525,m102,SARAH,I'm dying.
51994,L306368,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Every week --
51995,L306367,u1525,m102,SARAH,"Oh, God!"
51996,L306366,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Lilly's up.
51997,L306365,u1525,m102,SARAH,He has a reputation for being tough.
51998,L306364,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised."
51999,L306363,u1525,m102,SARAH,Well what does he want?
52000,L306362,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable."
52001,L306271,u1525,m102,SARAH,I wish I had your discipline.
52002,L306270,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
52003,L306266,u1525,m102,SARAH,We do have a man for you.
52004,L306265,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Maybe.
52005,L306258,u1525,m102,SARAH,Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
52006,L306257,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Who's she?
52007,L306254,u1525,m102,SARAH,By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
52008,L306253,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Do you know him?
52009,L306252,u1525,m102,SARAH,Of Massey Myerson?
52010,L306251,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,Miles Massey.
52011,L306246,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,"In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass."
52012,L306245,u1525,m102,SARAH,Wow.
52013,L306244,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,She did a Harriman.
52014,L306243,u1525,m102,SARAH,She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
52015,L306240,u1525,m102,SARAH,Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
52016,L306239,u1519,m102,MARYLIN,I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
52017,L306238,u1525,m102,SARAH,You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
52018,L306911,u1528,m102,WOMAN,"He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener."
52019,L306910,u1520,m102,MILES,"Yes, I know Howard Doyle."
52020,L306904,u1528,m102,WOMAN,You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
52021,L306903,u1520,m102,MILES,Excuse me?
52022,L306902,u1528,m102,WOMAN,You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
52023,L306901,u1520,m102,MILES,Yes?
52024,L306900,u1528,m102,WOMAN,Wait. I know you.
52025,L306294,u1528,m102,WOMAN,He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
52026,L306293,u1520,m102,MILES,"-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking."
52027,L306540,u1526,m102,VOICE,She's here now.
52028,L306539,u1520,m102,MILES,Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
52029,L306538,u1526,m102,VOICE,"I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you."
52030,L306537,u1520,m102,MILES,Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
52031,L306536,u1526,m102,VOICE,Mr. Massey --
52032,L306531,u1526,m102,VOICE,When you have a moment.
52033,L306530,u1520,m102,MILES,Herb wants to see me?
52034,L307121,u1524,m102,RUTH,We've outlined a settlement...
52035,L307120,u1520,m102,MILES,Where does that leave us?
52036,L306925,u1524,m102,RUTH,"That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --"
52037,L306924,u1520,m102,MILES,"...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?"
52038,L306923,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal."
52039,L306922,u1520,m102,MILES,I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
52040,L306921,u1524,m102,RUTH,And it's good!
52041,L306920,u1520,m102,MILES,Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
52042,L306919,u1524,m102,RUTH,"...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars..."
52043,L306918,u1520,m102,MILES,I don't have a pre-nup
52044,L306917,u1524,m102,RUTH,"She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup."
52045,L306916,u1520,m102,MILES,Did Marylin end up with money?
52046,L306915,u1524,m102,RUTH,I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
52047,L306914,u1520,m102,MILES,"He never ate the pre-nup, did he!"
52048,L306913,u1524,m102,RUTH,Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
52049,L306912,u1520,m102,MILES,He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
52050,L306440,u1520,m102,MILES,"Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?"
52051,L306439,u1524,m102,RUTH,...arty farty!
52052,L306346,u1524,m102,RUTH,Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
52053,L306345,u1520,m102,MILES,Are you familiar with Kirshner?
52054,L306336,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent."
52055,L306335,u1520,m102,MILES,Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
52056,L306334,u1524,m102,RUTH,Oh brother. Here we go.
52057,L306333,u1520,m102,MILES,"Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?"
52058,L306332,u1524,m102,RUTH,My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
52059,L306331,u1520,m102,MILES,"-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?"
52060,L306328,u1520,m102,MILES,Heh heh.
52061,L306327,u1524,m102,RUTH,Ha Ha.
52062,L306326,u1520,m102,MILES,My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
52063,L306325,u1524,m102,RUTH,My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
52064,L306324,u1520,m102,MILES,My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
52065,L306323,u1524,m102,RUTH,That's delusional.
52066,L306322,u1520,m102,MILES,My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
52067,L306321,u1524,m102,RUTH,My client has ruled that out.
52068,L306320,u1520,m102,MILES,At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
52069,L306319,u1524,m102,RUTH,"So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it."
52070,L306315,u1524,m102,RUTH,"Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family."
52071,L306314,u1520,m102,MILES,What?!
52072,L306311,u1520,m102,MILES,"A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert."
52073,L306310,u1524,m102,RUTH,Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
52074,L306309,u1520,m102,MILES,"So, Ruth. How's Sam?"
52075,L306359,u1523,m102,REX,Maybe I should reconsider my...
52076,L306358,u1520,m102,MILES,In anticipation of making you sick.
52077,L306357,u1523,m102,REX,She brought my digestive enzymes.
52078,L306356,u1520,m102,MILES,And she had private investigators assisting her.
52079,L306355,u1523,m102,REX,She always looked out for me.
52080,L306354,u1520,m102,MILES,I think that went as well as could be expected.
52081,L306348,u1520,m102,MILES,"Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?"
52082,L306347,u1523,m102,REX,What's Kirshner?
52083,L306237,u1523,m102,REX,Well -- is that possible?
52084,L306236,u1520,m102,MILES,"So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?"
52085,L306235,u1523,m102,REX,"I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions."
52086,L306234,u1520,m102,MILES,Nothing?
52087,L306233,u1523,m102,REX,That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
52088,L306232,u1520,m102,MILES,"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?"
52089,L306231,u1520,m102,MILES,"Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?"
52090,L306230,u1523,m102,REX,Video.
52091,L306229,u1520,m102,MILES,And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
52092,L306228,u1523,m102,REX,I'm not sure.
52093,L306227,u1520,m102,MILES,Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
52094,L306226,u1523,m102,REX,I don't know. I can assume...
52095,L306225,u1520,m102,MILES,"Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the ""knock-out, sexy woman"" you described?"
52096,L306224,u1523,m102,REX,Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
52097,L306223,u1520,m102,MILES,"Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex."
52098,L306222,u1523,m102,REX,"You know what I mean when I say ""it."""
52099,L306221,u1520,m102,MILES,Ah.
52100,L306220,u1523,m102,REX,No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
52101,L306219,u1520,m102,MILES,Time marches on. Ardor cools.
52102,L306218,u1523,m102,REX,But then... But then...
52103,L306217,u1520,m102,MILES,Mm.
52104,L306216,u1523,m102,REX,"When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other."
52105,L306215,u1520,m102,MILES,That's her job. You have to respect that.
52106,L306214,u1523,m102,REX,"...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place."
52107,L306211,u1520,m102,MILES,Now Rex.
52108,L306210,u1523,m102,REX,Thank you.
52109,L306209,u1520,m102,MILES,"Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign."
52110,L306208,u1523,m102,REX,"Rex, please."
52111,L306207,u1520,m102,MILES,Mr. Rexroth.
52112,L306856,u1520,m102,MILES,Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
52113,L306855,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,Extinguish?
52114,L306825,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,-- the coin?
52115,L306824,u1520,m102,MILES,"Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the..."
52116,L306814,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,"The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson."
52117,L306813,u1520,m102,MILES,We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
52118,L306812,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,"I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her."
52119,L306791,u1520,m102,MILES,Do you have it?
52120,L306790,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
52121,L306789,u1520,m102,MILES,"Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck."
52122,L306788,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,Miles.
52123,L306787,u1520,m102,MILES,Wrigley?
52124,L306688,u1520,m102,MILES,"I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?"
52125,L306687,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,"I'd stay away from her, Miles."
52126,L306686,u1520,m102,MILES,She owes me a meal.
52127,L306685,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,What...?
52128,L306684,u1520,m102,MILES,Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
52129,L306683,u1520,m102,MILES,"She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power."
52130,L306682,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,She could buy and sell you ten times over.
52131,L306681,u1520,m102,MILES,"Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?"
52132,L306680,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
52133,L306679,u1520,m102,MILES,HA!
52134,L306678,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
52135,L306640,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,Miles -- why so angry?
52136,L306639,u1520,m102,MILES,"Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --"
52137,L306638,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,Berry spoons.
52138,L306637,u1520,m102,MILES,What are they?
52139,L306636,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,What do you think?
52140,L306625,u1520,m102,MILES,Is she going through with it?
52141,L306624,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,"I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic."
52142,L306623,u1520,m102,MILES,What the hell is wrong with you?
52143,L306289,u1520,m102,MILES,I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
52144,L306288,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,No. You're not.
52145,L306287,u1520,m102,MILES,Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
52146,L306286,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,I am very sorry.
52147,L306285,u1520,m102,MILES,Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
52148,L306284,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,Sorry.
52149,L306283,u1520,m102,MILES,Wrigley!
52150,L306282,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,What the fuck...?
52151,L306281,u1520,m102,MILES,Video.
52152,L306280,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,And she has...?
52153,L306279,u1520,m102,MILES,Nothing.
52154,L306278,u1529,m102,WRIGLEY,Wait... He wants to give her...?
52155,L306484,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,"Well, not just divorce. She used to say ""I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..."" And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty"
52156,L306483,u1520,m102,MILES,Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
52157,L306482,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,"When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  ""When I grow up, I want to be divorced."""
52158,L306481,u1520,m102,MILES,I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
52159,L306480,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,"Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing ""Some Like It Hot."" To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe."
52160,L306479,u1520,m102,MILES,"Who's ""Patty."""
52161,L306478,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,Let me tell you something about Patty.
52162,L306477,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
52163,L306476,u1520,m102,MILES,Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
52164,L306473,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
52165,L306472,u1520,m102,MILES,You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
52166,L306471,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,"No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there."
52167,L306468,u1520,m102,MILES,Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
52168,L306467,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,"Hi, Sweetie."
52169,L306464,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,Mother?
52170,L306463,u1520,m102,MILES,And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
52171,L306460,u1521,m102,PATRICIA,We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
52172,L306459,u1520,m102,MILES,"Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth."
52173,L306492,u1525,m102,SARAH,"Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?"
52174,L306491,u1522,m102,RAMONA,That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
52175,L306269,u1522,m102,RAMONA,And only two are hers.
52176,L306268,u1525,m102,SARAH,She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
52177,L306267,u1522,m102,RAMONA,Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
52178,L306264,u1522,m102,RAMONA,Maybe next time.
52179,L306263,u1525,m102,SARAH,It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
52180,L306256,u1525,m102,SARAH,Muriel Rumsey.
52181,L306255,u1522,m102,RAMONA,George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
52182,L306250,u1525,m102,SARAH,Who's Rex's guy?
52183,L306249,u1522,m102,RAMONA,Three is not Farrow.
52184,L306248,u1525,m102,SARAH,Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
52185,L306247,u1522,m102,RAMONA,"I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way."
52186,L310944,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her."
52187,L310943,u1542,m103,LOVINGTON,No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
52188,L310942,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
52189,L310941,u1542,m103,LOVINGTON,"I've put extra men on, all along the way."
52190,L310940,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
52191,L310939,u1542,m103,LOVINGTON,"We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews."
52192,L311437,u1544,m103,MARY,"Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door."
52193,L311436,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?"
52194,L311435,u1544,m103,MARY,"Oh, no, sir. No different than"
52195,L311434,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,What's the matter? Anything wrong?
52196,L311433,u1544,m103,MARY,"Whyuhshe's all right, sir."
52197,L311432,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,How is she?
52198,L311431,u1544,m103,MARY,"Yes, sir?"
52199,L311430,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,OhMary
52200,L311554,u1548,m103,PETER,Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
52201,L311553,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I asked you a question. Do you love her?
52202,L311552,u1548,m103,PETER,"A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!"
52203,L311551,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Do you love her?
52204,L311550,u1548,m103,PETER,"If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago."
52205,L311549,u1548,m103,PETER,She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
52206,L311548,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,That's an evasion.
52207,L311547,u1548,m103,PETER,A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
52208,L311546,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
52209,L311544,u1548,m103,PETER,"Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?"
52210,L311543,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,You were taken for a buggy ride?
52211,L311542,u1548,m103,PETER,"Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege."
52212,L311541,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
52213,L311540,u1548,m103,PETER,We'll go into that some other time.
52214,L311539,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,You're a peculiar chap.
52215,L311538,u1548,m103,PETER,All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
52216,L311537,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for"
52217,L311536,u1548,m103,PETER,Who said anything about a reward!
52218,L311535,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,The reward.
52219,L311534,u1548,m103,PETER,What ten thousand?
52220,L311533,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
52221,L311532,u1548,m103,PETER,What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
52222,L311531,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Yes, I knowbut"
52223,L311530,u1548,m103,PETER,Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
52224,L311529,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
52225,L311528,u1548,m103,PETER,"I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in."
52226,L311527,u1548,m103,PETER,If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized.
52227,L311526,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
52228,L311525,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose."
52229,L311524,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get."
52230,L311523,u1548,m103,PETER,That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
52231,L311522,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
52232,L311521,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Come in. Sit down.
52233,L311520,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah.
52234,L311519,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Mr. Warne?
52235,L311514,u1548,m103,PETER,Nono. What the deuce do I want to
52236,L311513,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if
52237,L311512,u1548,m103,PETER,"Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain."
52238,L311378,u1548,m103,PETER,"""I found a million dollar baby"""
52239,L311377,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing."
52240,L311503,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King."
52241,L311502,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters."
52242,L311498,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
52243,L311497,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I suppose so.
52244,L311496,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Are you going to see him?
52245,L311495,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I'm sorry you read it.
52246,L311494,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
52247,L311493,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, please, Dad"
52248,L311492,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Why, no . . . Don't be silly."
52249,L311491,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?"
52250,L311490,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Oh, nono."
52251,L311489,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Why? Do you know him?
52252,L311488,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Peter Warne!
52253,L311487,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Yes. Peter Warne.
52254,L311486,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Is that his name?
52255,L311485,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again."
52256,L311482,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember."
52257,L311481,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why"
52258,L311480,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"No, I'll go through with it."
52259,L311479,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?"
52260,L311478,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him."
52261,L311477,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I'd like to have a talk with him.
52262,L311476,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I don't know.
52263,L311475,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?"
52264,L311474,u1535,m103,ELLIE,He's marvelous!
52265,L311473,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Fine man to fall in love with.
52266,L311472,u1535,m103,ELLIE,He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
52267,L311471,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Well!
52268,L311470,u1535,m103,ELLIE,He doesn't think so much of you either.
52269,L311469,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Ridiculous!
52270,L311468,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere."
52271,L311467,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Oh, come now"
52272,L311466,u1535,m103,ELLIE,It'll do no good.  He despises me.
52273,L311465,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to"
52274,L311464,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
52275,L311463,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Who is he?
52276,L311462,u1535,m103,ELLIE,No.
52277,L311461,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!"
52278,L311460,u1535,m103,ELLIE,On the road.
52279,L311459,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
52280,L311454,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that."
52281,L311453,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be."
52282,L311452,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, no."
52283,L311451,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?"
52284,L311450,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Nothing.
52285,L311449,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?"
52286,L311446,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too."
52287,L311445,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, yes. I heard."
52288,L311444,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
52289,L311443,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Stunt?
52290,L311442,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull."
52291,L311441,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
52292,L311440,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I knocked several times.
52293,L311439,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, hello, Dad."
52294,L311438,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Ellie
52295,L310503,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it."
52296,L310502,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
52297,L310501,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Please don't shout.
52298,L310500,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
52299,L310499,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
52300,L310494,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
52301,L310493,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to."
52302,L310492,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
52303,L310491,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example."
52304,L310490,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"You're going to finance him, I suppose."
52305,L310489,u1535,m103,ELLIE,He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
52306,L310488,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks."
52307,L310487,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
52308,L310486,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
52309,L310485,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You only met him once .
52310,L310484,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all."
52311,L310483,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What've you got against King Westley?
52312,L310482,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!"
52313,L310481,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You'll never do it! You can't do it!
52314,L310480,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I'll get it annulled.
52315,L310479,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
52316,L310478,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"In that event, we won't need so many supplies."
52317,L310477,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
52318,L310476,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
52319,L310475,u1535,m103,ELLIE,South America!
52320,L310474,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,South America.
52321,L310473,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Where are you taking me?
52322,L310471,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
52323,L310470,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
52324,L310469,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
52325,L310468,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India."
52326,L310467,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Smart, aren't you! So subtle."
52327,L310460,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?"
52328,L310459,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
52329,L310458,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Because marrying that fool King Westley is
52330,L310457,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
52331,L310456,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,You ought to know why. Because
52332,L310455,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
52333,L310454,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way."
52334,L310453,u1535,m103,ELLIE,All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
52335,L310452,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I might.
52336,L310451,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Why don't you put me in chains?
52337,L310450,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
52338,L310449,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
52339,L310448,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,What's this about not eating?
52340,L311229,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back.
52341,L311228,u1553,m103,WESTLEY,"If you really mean it, I will."
52342,L311227,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?"
52343,L311226,u1553,m103,WESTLEY,Why should she? After all
52344,L311225,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me."
52345,L311224,u1553,m103,WESTLEY,"might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I"
52346,L310513,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, ""Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"""
52347,L310512,u1532,m103,CAPTAIN,What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
52348,L310511,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
52349,L310510,u1532,m103,CAPTAIN,What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
52350,L310506,u1532,m103,CAPTAIN,Lower the boats!
52351,L310505,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,It's my daughter! Go after her.
52352,L310442,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
52353,L310441,u1532,m103,CAPTAIN,"It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one"
52354,L310440,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
52355,L310439,u1532,m103,CAPTAIN,Yessir. She refuses them all.
52356,L310438,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Been sending her meals in regularly?
52357,L310437,u1532,m103,CAPTAIN,She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
52358,L310436,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?"
52359,L311582,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,I haven't the slightest idea.
52360,L311581,u1541,m103,KING,What happened?
52361,L311428,u1541,m103,KING,"Yes, of course."
52362,L311427,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,We've done that already.
52363,L311426,u1541,m103,KING,"Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye."
52364,L311425,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object."
52365,L311424,u1541,m103,KING,"Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that"
52366,L311423,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"You thought that up all by yourself, huh?"
52367,L311421,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
52368,L311420,u1541,m103,KING,"Yes, sir."
52369,L311419,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?"
52370,L311416,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Sock her!
52371,L311415,u1541,m103,KING,What would you like to have me do?
52372,L311414,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell."
52373,L311413,u1541,m103,KING,"Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility."
52374,L311407,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Someday perhaps, you might even take charge."
52375,L311406,u1541,m103,KING,You talk as if
52376,L311405,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
52377,L311404,u1541,m103,KING,"Why; naturally, I"
52378,L311223,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy."
52379,L311222,u1541,m103,KING,"You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment."
52380,L311221,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?"
52381,L311587,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"""What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling.""  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: ""Let 'em topple."""
52382,L311586,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,"There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan."
52383,L311585,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,"Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows."
52384,L311584,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,But it's King Westley on the phone.
52385,L311583,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
52386,L310787,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,"They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir."
52387,L310786,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Amateurs!
52388,L310785,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,"They're practically all the same, sir."
52389,L310784,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,What do they say?
52390,L310783,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
52391,L310782,u1530,m103,ANDREWS,Any others?
52392,L310781,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,"Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  ""Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible."" Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston."
52393,L310979,u1531,m103,BOY,Thanks.
52394,L310978,u1548,m103,PETER,"Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions."
52395,L310972,u1531,m103,BOY,"I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess."
52396,L310971,u1548,m103,PETER,"Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?"
52397,L310970,u1531,m103,BOY,"Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it."
52398,L310969,u1548,m103,PETER,What happened to your money?
52399,L310968,u1531,m103,BOY,We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
52400,L310698,u1531,m103,BOY,But the lady says
52401,L310697,u1548,m103,PETER,"Never mind, son. She doesn't want it."

52405,L311198,u1548,m103,PETER,"No, thanks. We're not hungry."
52406,L311195,u1533,m103,DANKER,". . . turn."""
52407,L311194,u1548,m103,PETER,"All right, let it go."
52408,L311193,u1533,m103,DANKER,"Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  ""My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . ."
52409,L311192,u1548,m103,PETER,"Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?"
52410,L310983,u1534,m103,DRIVER,Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
52411,L310982,u1548,m103,PETER,Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
52412,L310981,u1534,m103,DRIVER,That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
52413,L310582,u1534,m103,DRIVER,Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
52414,L310581,u1548,m103,PETER,"These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?"
52415,L310580,u1534,m103,DRIVER,Yeah?
52416,L310579,u1548,m103,PETER,Driver!
52417,L310571,u1548,m103,PETER,You win!
52418,L310570,u1534,m103,DRIVER,"Oh, yeah?"
52419,L310569,u1548,m103,PETER,"Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago."
52420,L310568,u1534,m103,DRIVER,"Oh, yeah?"
52421,L310567,u1548,m103,PETER,"Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss."
52422,L310566,u1534,m103,DRIVER,"Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose."
52423,L310565,u1548,m103,PETER,It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
52424,L310564,u1534,m103,DRIVER,What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
52425,L310563,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants."
52426,L310562,u1534,m103,DRIVER,"Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?"
52427,L310561,u1548,m103,PETER,"That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants."
52428,L310560,u1548,m103,PETER,Ohthe papers
52429,L310559,u1534,m103,DRIVER,The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
52430,L310558,u1548,m103,PETER,Huh?
52431,L310557,u1534,m103,DRIVER,What do you think you're doing!
52432,L310554,u1548,m103,PETER,"Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off."
52433,L310553,u1534,m103,DRIVER,"Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller."
52434,L310552,u1548,m103,PETER,If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
52435,L310551,u1534,m103,DRIVER,Whadda you want!
52436,L311561,u1548,m103,PETER,I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
52437,L311560,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
52438,L311559,u1548,m103,PETER,Same to you.
52439,L311558,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Congratulations.
52440,L311557,u1548,m103,PETER,You bet I did.
52441,L311556,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I hope you got your money.
52442,L311277,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter"
52443,L311276,u1548,m103,PETER,You're forgetting you're married.
52444,L311275,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I love you.
52445,L311274,u1548,m103,PETER,Better go back to your bed.
52446,L311269,u1548,m103,PETER,"Maybe.  Suresure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd  Yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more."
52447,L311268,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
52448,L311267,u1548,m103,PETER,Me?
52449,L311266,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
52450,L311258,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Why not?
52451,L311257,u1548,m103,PETER,Nope.
52452,L311256,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
52453,L311252,u1548,m103,PETER,"Yeah, swell."
52454,L311251,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?"
52455,L311241,u1548,m103,PETER,Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
52456,L311240,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
52457,L311239,u1548,m103,PETER,"I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours."
52458,L311238,u1535,m103,ELLIE,That's swell!
52459,L311237,u1548,m103,PETER,Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
52460,L311236,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What about money?
52461,L311235,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
52462,L311234,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Any luck?
52463,L311219,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Darling!
52464,L311218,u1548,m103,PETER,You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
52465,L311216,u1548,m103,PETER,A black eye.
52466,L311215,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What'd you give him for the car?
52467,L311214,u1548,m103,PETER,Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
52468,L311213,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What happened?
52469,L311212,u1548,m103,PETER,Come on! come on!
52470,L311211,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on"
52471,L311210,u1548,m103,PETER,Come onget in.
52472,L311209,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?"
52473,L311206,u1548,m103,PETER,"If you do, I'll break your neck."
52474,L311205,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Never!  I'm going in and ask him
52475,L311204,u1548,m103,PETER,Eat a carrot.
52476,L311203,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Why not? I'm hungry.
52477,L311202,u1548,m103,PETER,What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
52478,L311189,u1535,m103,ELLIE,We don't need forty cars.
52479,L311188,u1548,m103,PETER,Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
52480,L311187,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
52481,L311186,u1548,m103,PETER,What for?
52482,L311185,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You might give me a little credit.
52483,L311184,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Mind your own business.
52484,L311183,u1548,m103,PETER,What're you going to do?
52485,L311182,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
52486,L311181,u1548,m103,PETER,You! Don't make me laugh.
52487,L311180,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
52488,L311179,u1548,m103,PETER,I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
52489,L311178,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"When you get up to a hundred, wake me up."
52490,L311177,u1548,m103,PETER,Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
52491,L311175,u1548,m103,PETER,"Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens."
52492,L311174,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Here comes a car!
52493,L311173,u1548,m103,PETER,"Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it."
52494,L311172,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Amazing.
52495,L311171,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through."
52496,L311170,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"You figured that all out yourself, huh?"
52497,L311169,u1548,m103,PETER,Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
52498,L311168,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Clever.
52499,L311167,u1548,m103,PETER,"But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?"
52500,L311164,u1548,m103,PETER,"Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it"
52501,L311163,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, no!"
52502,L311162,u1548,m103,PETER,"You think it's simple, huh?"
52503,L311161,u1535,m103,ELLIE,There's no end to your accomplishments.
52504,L311160,u1548,m103,PETER,"Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the ""Hitch-Hikers Hail."""
52505,L311159,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"You're an expert, I suppose."
52506,L311158,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them."
52507,L311157,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What if nobody stops for us?
52508,L311156,u1548,m103,PETER,I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
52509,L311155,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I hate the horrid stuff.
52510,L311154,u1548,m103,PETER,You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
52511,L311153,u1535,m103,ELLIE,No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
52512,L311152,u1548,m103,PETER,Uh-huh. Want one?
52513,L311151,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Raw?
52514,L311150,u1548,m103,PETER,Carrots.
52515,L311149,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
52516,L311148,u1548,m103,PETER,There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
52517,L311147,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Hayin my teeth.
52518,L311146,u1548,m103,PETER,No. But I've got a penknife.
52519,L311145,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?"
52520,L311142,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking"
52521,L311141,u1548,m103,PETER,Hitch-hiking.
52522,L311140,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
52523,L311139,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
52524,L311138,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Really?
52525,L311137,u1548,m103,PETER,"By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you."
52526,L311136,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What are you thinking about?
52527,L311134,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Doesn't sound very exciting.
52528,L311133,u1548,m103,PETER,I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
52529,L311130,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Try me.
52530,L311129,u1548,m103,PETER,Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
52531,L311128,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What?
52532,L311127,u1548,m103,PETER,Sure.
52533,L311120,u1548,m103,PETER,Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
52534,L311119,u1535,m103,ELLIE,was so scaredthat it scared
52535,L311118,u1548,m103,PETER,But what!
52536,L311117,u1535,m103,ELLIE,wasbut
52537,L311116,u1548,m103,PETER,Thought you were hungry!
52538,L311115,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I don't want it now.
52539,L311114,u1548,m103,PETER,Here. Eat your head off.
52540,L311113,u1535,m103,ELLIE,knowbut
52541,L311112,u1548,m103,PETER,I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
52542,L311111,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, Peter! I was so scared."
52543,L311110,u1548,m103,PETER,What's got into you?
52544,L311109,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, Peter"
52545,L311108,u1548,m103,PETER,What's the matter?
52546,L311104,u1548,m103,PETER,All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
52547,L311103,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What!
52548,L311102,u1548,m103,PETER,"Well, take them off."
52549,L311101,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
52550,L311099,u1548,m103,PETER,Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
52551,L311098,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
52552,L311097,u1548,m103,PETER,All right. You win. Let's forget it.
52553,L311096,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Not if you're more hungry than scared.
52554,L311095,u1548,m103,PETER,If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
52555,L311089,u1548,m103,PETER,What?
52556,L311088,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Peter
52557,L311087,u1548,m103,PETER,"I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it."
52558,L311086,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"We're not going to sleep out here, are we?"
52559,L311085,u1548,m103,PETER,This looks like the best spot.
52560,L311080,u1548,m103,PETER,"Show me a good ""piggy-back"" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural ""piggy-backer.""  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about ""piggy-back"" riding that he"
52561,L311079,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You're prejudiced.
52562,L311078,u1548,m103,PETER,Not a one.
52563,L311077,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose."
52564,L311076,u1548,m103,PETER,"To be a ""piggy-backer"" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature."
52565,L311075,u1535,m103,ELLIE,That's silly.
52566,L311074,u1548,m103,PETER,"I don't think there's a ""piggy- back"" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good ""piggy-back"" rider."
52567,L311073,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride ""piggy-back."""
52568,L311072,u1548,m103,PETER,"Your father didn't know beans about ""piggy-back"" riding."
52569,L311071,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Yes.
52570,L311070,u1548,m103,PETER,"And he carried you like this, I suppose."
52571,L311069,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"remember distinctly Father taking me for a ""piggy-back"" ride"
52572,L311068,u1548,m103,PETER,You're crazy.
52573,L311067,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Of course it is.
52574,L311066,u1548,m103,PETER,"This isn't ""piggy-back."""
52575,L311065,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden ""piggy-back"" in years."
52576,L311064,u1548,m103,PETER,I wish you'd stop being playful.
52577,L311063,u1548,m103,PETER,Okay. Hang on to these.
52578,L311062,u1535,m103,ELLIE,No.
52579,L311061,u1548,m103,PETER,Aren't you afraid of me?
52580,L311060,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I'm following you.
52581,L311059,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah.
52582,L311058,u1535,m103,ELLIE,To New York?
52583,L311057,u1548,m103,PETER,Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
52584,L311056,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
52585,L311055,u1548,m103,PETER,I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
52586,L311054,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You didn't give that boy all your money?
52587,L311053,u1548,m103,PETER,Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
52588,L311052,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, haven't you?"
52589,L311051,u1548,m103,PETER,It takes money to buy food.
52590,L311050,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What do you meanstarvation?
52591,L311049,u1548,m103,PETER,"Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet."
52592,L311048,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Not as long as I'm alive.
52593,L311047,u1548,m103,PETER,"First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father."
52594,L311046,u1548,m103,PETER,I don't trust that chatterbox.
52595,L311045,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
52596,L311044,u1548,m103,PETER,What's the matter?
52597,L311043,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!"
52598,L311042,u1548,m103,PETER,"At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him."
52599,L311041,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
52600,L310955,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Yes.
52601,L310954,u1548,m103,PETER,Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
52602,L310953,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I better go over and see her.
52603,L310930,u1548,m103,PETER,Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
52604,L310929,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I refuse to resign!
52605,L310928,u1548,m103,PETER,"If you don't like it, you can resign from the company."
52606,L310927,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You always want to run everything.
52607,L310926,u1548,m103,PETER,"I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?"
52608,L310925,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?"
52609,L310924,u1548,m103,PETER,No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
52610,L310923,u1535,m103,ELLIE,How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
52611,L310922,u1548,m103,PETER,"After that ""The Three Musketeers.""  I'd make a great D'Artagnan."
52612,L310921,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Next week ""East Lynne."""
52613,L310920,u1548,m103,PETER,"We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one ""The Great Deception.""[8]"
52614,L310919,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You weren't so bad yourself.
52615,L310918,u1548,m103,PETER,"Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?"
52616,L310909,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute."
52617,L310908,u1548,m103,PETER,"Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!"
52618,L310907,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!"
52619,L310906,u1548,m103,PETER,I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
52620,L310905,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Well, you were!"
52621,L310904,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, so now I was drunk!"
52622,L310901,u1535,m103,ELLIE,He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
52623,L310900,u1548,m103,PETER,You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
52624,L310899,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Well, you don't have to lose your temper!"
52625,L310898,u1548,m103,PETER,There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
52626,L310897,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question."
52627,L310879,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What are you talking about?
52628,L310878,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
52629,L310874,u1548,m103,PETER,Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
52630,L310873,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?"
52631,L310872,u1548,m103,PETER,Detectives!
52632,L310869,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
52633,L310868,u1548,m103,PETER,Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
52634,L310867,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Thanks, professor."
52635,L310866,u1548,m103,PETER,"Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it."
52636,L310865,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk."
52637,L310864,u1548,m103,PETER,"Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?"
52638,L310863,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
52639,L310862,u1548,m103,PETER,Oh. Is that how you met him?
52640,L310861,u1535,m103,ELLIE,KingKing Westley was in it.
52641,L310860,u1548,m103,PETER,Santa Claus?
52642,L310859,u1535,m103,ELLIE,It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
52643,L310858,u1548,m103,PETER,One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
52644,L310857,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun."
52645,L310856,u1548,m103,PETER,Um. You're doing all right.
52646,L310855,u1535,m103,ELLIE,It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
52647,L310854,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah?
52648,L310853,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!"
52649,L310852,u1548,m103,PETER,No. No. It's too good a story.
52650,L310851,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything."
52651,L310850,u1548,m103,PETER,Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
52652,L310849,u1535,m103,ELLIE,He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
52653,L310848,u1548,m103,PETER,"I thought maybeuh""believe you me"" told you a couple of snappy stories."
52654,L310847,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Must be the Spring.
52655,L310846,u1548,m103,PETER,What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
52656,L310845,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this."
52657,L310844,u1548,m103,PETER,I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
52658,L310843,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Nope. No complaints.
52659,L310842,u1548,m103,PETER,Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
52660,L310841,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs."
52661,L310840,u1548,m103,PETER,"I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down."
52662,L310839,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to."
52663,L310838,u1548,m103,PETER,If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
52664,L310837,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?"
52665,L310836,u1548,m103,PETER,Hurry up and get dressed.
52666,L310835,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?"
52667,L310832,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
52668,L310831,u1548,m103,PETER,High time you got back.
52669,L310821,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I'll find it myself.
52670,L310820,u1548,m103,PETER,Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
52671,L310819,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Where is the shower?
52672,L310818,u1548,m103,PETER,"Heyyou're little, aren't you?"
52673,L310817,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Where'd you say the showersand thingswere?
52674,L310815,u1548,m103,PETER,Heretake mine.
52675,L310814,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Like this. I have no robe.
52676,L310813,u1548,m103,PETER,Like what?
52677,L310812,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I can't go out like this.
52678,L310811,u1548,m103,PETER,"Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside."
52679,L310810,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Outside!
52680,L310809,u1548,m103,PETER,You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage.
52681,L310804,u1548,m103,PETER,"Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself."
52682,L310803,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?"
52683,L310802,u1548,m103,PETER,Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
52684,L310801,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed."
52685,L310800,u1548,m103,PETER,Here
52686,L310768,u1548,m103,PETER,The pleasure is all mine.
52687,L310767,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ..."
52688,L310766,u1548,m103,PETER,Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
52689,L310765,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Peter Warne? I don't like it.
52690,L310764,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
52691,L310763,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"You've got a name, haven't you?"
52692,L310762,u1548,m103,PETER,"Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face."
52693,L310761,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Who are you?
52694,L310756,u1548,m103,PETER,Not at all.
52695,L310755,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Do you mind putting out the light?
52696,L310750,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Smart aleck!
52697,L310749,u1548,m103,PETER,"I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I"
52698,L310746,u1548,m103,PETER,"All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike."
52699,L310745,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"You're not really serious about this, are you?"
52700,L310744,u1548,m103,PETER,Do you mind joining the Israelites?
52701,L310743,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas."
52702,L310742,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right."
52703,L310741,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right."
52704,L310740,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind."
52705,L310739,u1548,m103,PETER,"This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments."
52706,L310738,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this."
52707,L310737,u1548,m103,PETER,"Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it."
52708,L310733,u1548,m103,PETER,"Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?"
52709,L310732,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Your ego is colossal.
52710,L310731,u1548,m103,PETER,I kind of half expected you to thank me.
52711,L310730,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?"
52712,L310729,u1548,m103,PETER,"Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs."
52713,L310728,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
52714,L310727,u1548,m103,PETER,"Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift."
52715,L310726,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Darn clever, these Armenians."
52716,L310721,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
52717,L310720,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Are you talking to me!
52718,L310719,u1548,m103,PETER,"Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step."
52719,L310706,u1548,m103,PETER,Shut up!
52720,L310705,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Now, just a minuteyou can't"
52721,L310704,u1548,m103,PETER,You're on a budget from now on.
52722,L310703,u1535,m103,ELLIE,That's none of your business.
52723,L310702,u1548,m103,PETER,A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
52724,L310701,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"You have your nerve!  Here, boy!"
52725,L310700,u1548,m103,PETER,Beat it!
52726,L310699,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Of course I do. What do you mean
52727,L310694,u1535,m103,ELLIE,No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
52728,L310693,u1548,m103,PETER,What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
52729,L310692,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Here, boy!"
52730,L310690,u1548,m103,PETER,Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
52731,L310689,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you."
52732,L310658,u1548,m103,PETER,"Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word ""Humility""? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, ""Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?"" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me."
52733,L310657,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York."
52734,L310656,u1548,m103,PETER,I never thought of that.
52735,L310655,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it."
52736,L310654,u1548,m103,PETER,What for?
52737,L310653,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"You're not going to notify my father, are you?"
52738,L310652,u1548,m103,PETER,That's right. You didn't.
52739,L310651,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I didn't ask for your advice.
52740,L310650,u1548,m103,PETER,Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
52741,L310649,u1548,m103,PETER,"Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley."
52742,L310648,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You must have me confused with
52743,L310647,u1548,m103,PETER,"You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York."
52744,L310646,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
52745,L310645,u1548,m103,PETER,Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
52746,L310644,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What are you talking about?
52747,L310643,u1548,m103,PETER,"You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews."
52748,L310642,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket."
52749,L310641,u1548,m103,PETER,I found it on the seat.
52750,L310640,u1535,m103,ELLIE,My ticket?
52751,L310639,u1548,m103,PETER,You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
52752,L310638,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself."
52753,L310636,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too."
52754,L310635,u1548,m103,PETER,"What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian."
52755,L310631,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
52756,L310630,u1548,m103,PETER,Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
52757,L310617,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"No, thank you.  Thank you so much."
52758,L310616,u1548,m103,PETER,I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
52759,L310615,u1535,m103,ELLIE,That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
52760,L310614,u1548,m103,PETER,Yes.
52761,L310613,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?"
52762,L310608,u1548,m103,PETER,"Why, you ungrateful brat!"
52763,L310607,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her."
52764,L310606,u1548,m103,PETER,"Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that"
52765,L310605,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I don't want it reported!
52766,L310604,u1548,m103,PETER,Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
52767,L310603,u1535,m103,ELLIE,No. I'd rather you didn't.
52768,L310602,u1548,m103,PETER,"I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean."
52769,L310601,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will."
52770,L310600,u1548,m103,PETER,You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
52771,L310599,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it."
52772,L310598,u1548,m103,PETER,Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
52773,L310597,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What am I going to do now?
52774,L310596,u1548,m103,PETER,"That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!"
52775,L310595,u1535,m103,ELLIE,What happened?
52776,L310594,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
52777,L310593,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, my heavens! It's gone!"
52778,L310592,u1548,m103,PETER,Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
52779,L310591,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested."
52780,L310587,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
52781,L310586,u1548,m103,PETER,Are you talking to me?
52782,L310585,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Tell that man not to drive so fast.
52783,L310575,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Driver!
52784,L310574,u1548,m103,PETER,"Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram."
52785,L310573,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I beg your pardon!
52786,L311262,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Won't I ever see you again?
52787,L311261,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,Not interested.
52788,L311260,u1535,m103,ELLIE,No harm in your coming to see us.
52789,L311254,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
52790,L311253,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
52791,L311132,u1535,m103,ELLIE,You sound like a hobo.
52792,L311131,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,"I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around."
52793,L311126,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Do you know?
52794,L311125,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,"Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want."
52795,L311094,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Well, I am."
52796,L311093,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
52797,L311092,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared."
52798,L310885,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,Whome?  Want to see me?
52799,L310884,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart."
52800,L310876,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,"Come here, you little fool!"
52801,L310875,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
52802,L310808,u1535,m103,ELLIE,I'm out! I'm out!
52803,L310807,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,sixseveneightnine
52804,L310806,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, you bully. I believe you would."
52805,L310805,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
52806,L310773,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Goodnight, Mr. Warne."
52807,L310772,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,"I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?"
52808,L310736,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?"
52809,L310735,u1549,m103,PETER'S VOICE,"Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me."
52810,L310734,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited"
52811,L311509,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging."
52812,L311508,u1541,m103,KING,"Whatever you say, darling."
52813,L311507,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going."
52814,L311506,u1541,m103,KING,You bet we did.
52815,L311505,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?"
52816,L311504,u1541,m103,KING,"How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?"
52817,L310634,u1540,m103,GUARD,"Sorry, Miss."
52818,L310633,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!"
52819,L310632,u1540,m103,GUARD,Eight o'clock tonight.
52820,L310628,u1540,m103,GUARD,"Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie."
52821,L310627,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!"
52822,L310626,u1540,m103,GUARD,Left twenty minutes ago.
52823,L310625,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Where's the bus to New York?
52824,L310522,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Thank you.
52825,L310521,u1545,m103,OLD LADY,In about fifteen minutes.
52826,L310520,u1535,m103,ELLIE,When does the bus leave?
52827,L310519,u1545,m103,OLD LADY,"Oh, thank you. Thank you."
52828,L310518,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here."
52829,L310517,u1545,m103,OLD LADY,"Here's your ticket, ma'am."
52830,L311357,u1554,m103,WIFE,You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
52831,L311356,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
52832,L311350,u1554,m103,WIFE,Ain't gonna wait a minute.
52833,L311349,u1535,m103,ELLIE,But can't you wait until morning
52834,L311348,u1554,m103,WIFE,Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
52835,L311347,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the"
52836,L311341,u1554,m103,WIFE,"Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . ."
52837,L311340,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Why, he'll be back."
52838,L311339,u1554,m103,WIFE,"No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too."
52839,L311338,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Isn't he here?
52840,L311337,u1554,m103,WIFE,Yesif he is your husband.
52841,L311336,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Husband?
52842,L311335,u1554,m103,WIFE,"What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady"
52843,L310830,u1552,m103,SHAPELEY,Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
52844,L310829,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Get out!
52845,L310828,u1552,m103,SHAPELEY,SorryI didn't mean to
52846,L310827,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours."
52847,L310826,u1552,m103,SHAPELEY,"Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir."
52848,L310679,u1535,m103,ELLIE,"Believe you me, you bore me to distraction."
52849,L310678,u1552,m103,SHAPELEY,"But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. ""Fun-on-the-side Shapeley"" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me."
52850,L310673,u1552,m103,SHAPELEY,"That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!"
52851,L310672,u1535,m103,ELLIE,Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
52852,L310671,u1552,m103,SHAPELEY,"You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much."
52853,L311091,u1548,m103,PETER,Just your imagination.
52854,L311090,u1536,m103,ELLIE'S VOICE,I'm hungry.
52855,L310799,u1548,m103,PETER,Eight o'clock.
52856,L310798,u1536,m103,ELLIE'S VOICE,What time is it?
52857,L310797,u1548,m103,PETER,Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
52858,L310771,u1548,m103,PETER,You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
52859,L310770,u1536,m103,ELLIE'S VOICE,Yes?
52860,L310769,u1548,m103,PETER,I've been thinking about you.
52861,L310760,u1548,m103,PETER,What's that?
52862,L310759,u1536,m103,ELLIE'S VOICE,"Oh, by the waywhat's your name?"
52863,L310758,u1536,m103,ELLIE'S VOICE,"Oh, excuse me."
52864,L310757,u1548,m103,PETER,Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
52865,L310780,u1550,m103,SECOND PILOT,How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
52866,L310779,u1537,m103,FIRST PILOT,The dame's too smart for him.
52867,L310778,u1550,m103,SECOND PILOT,Yeah!
52868,L310777,u1537,m103,FIRST PILOT,"I said, the old man's screwy!"
52869,L310776,u1550,m103,SECOND PILOT,What's 'at?
52870,L310775,u1537,m103,FIRST PILOT,The old man's screwy!
52871,L310718,u1548,m103,PETER,Thanks.
52872,L310717,u1538,m103,FIRST POLICEMAN,That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
52873,L310716,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah.
52874,L310715,u1538,m103,FIRST POLICEMAN,Up yonder. See the lights?
52875,L310714,u1548,m103,PETER,Yeah? Where?
52876,L310713,u1538,m103,FIRST POLICEMAN,Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
52877,L310710,u1538,m103,FIRST POLICEMAN,Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
52878,L310709,u1548,m103,PETER,What's up?
52879,L310937,u1539,m103,GORDON,Don't accept any more.
52880,L310936,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,Yes.
52881,L310935,u1539,m103,GORDON,Collect?
52882,L310934,u1539,m103,GORDON,"Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  ""Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."""
52883,L310933,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
52884,L310539,u1539,m103,GORDON,"What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours."
52885,L310538,u1551,m103,SECRETARY,Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
52886,L310537,u1539,m103,GORDON,Huh?

52891,L311398,u1539,m103,GORDON,Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
52892,L311397,u1548,m103,PETER,"Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?"
52893,L311396,u1539,m103,GORDON,Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
52894,L311395,u1548,m103,PETER,"Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you."

There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country."
53065,L327894,u1568,m104,JIM,"Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean."
53066,L327893,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,There were no phone records.
53067,L327892,u1568,m104,JIM,"Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?"
53068,L327891,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog."
53069,L327890,u1568,m104,JIM,Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
53070,L327889,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim."
53071,L327888,u1568,m104,JIM,Recall any names?
53072,L327887,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember..."
53073,L327886,u1568,m104,JIM,So you saw Oswald how many times?
53074,L327885,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge..."
53075,L327884,u1568,m104,JIM,And Oswald?
53076,L327883,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
53077,L327882,u1568,m104,JIM,Did he pay?
53078,L327881,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English."
53079,L327880,u1568,m104,JIM,What was his voice like?
53080,L327874,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial..."
53081,L327873,u1568,m104,JIM,Street cats?
53082,L327872,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter."
53083,L327871,u1568,m104,JIM,When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
53084,L327870,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?"
53085,L327869,u1568,m104,JIM,"Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business."
53086,L327867,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude."
53087,L327866,u1568,m104,JIM,"Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?"
53088,L327865,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,Right.
53089,L327864,u1568,m104,JIM,"You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this ""Clay Bertrand"" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer."
53090,L327863,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
53091,L327862,u1568,m104,JIM,"Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and..."
53092,L327861,u1556,m104,ANDREWS,"Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school."
53093,L327533,u1577,m104,MARTIN,You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
53094,L327532,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?"
53095,L327531,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book."
53096,L327530,u1557,m104,BANISTER,You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
53097,L327529,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are."
53098,L327528,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?"
53099,L327527,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty."
53100,L327526,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not."
53101,L327525,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side."
53102,L327524,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight."
53103,L327523,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home."
53104,L327522,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?"
53105,L327513,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that."
53106,L327512,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink."
53107,L327511,u1557,m104,BANISTER,"A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart."
53108,L327510,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"God's sake, chief.  The President was shot."
53109,L327509,u1557,m104,BANISTER,All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
53110,L328472,u1558,m104,BILL,"Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality."
53111,L328471,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?"
53112,L327998,u1586,m104,SUSIE,No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
53113,L327997,u1558,m104,BILL,Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
53114,L327996,u1586,m104,SUSIE,Who?
53115,L327796,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted."
53116,L327795,u1558,m104,BILL,"Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court."
53117,L327794,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder."
53118,L327784,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow..."
53119,L327783,u1558,m104,BILL,"Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies."
53120,L328283,u1563,m104,FRANK,"Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard."
53121,L328282,u1558,m104,BILL,"No, I'm not..."
53122,L328281,u1563,m104,FRANK,"Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing."
53123,L328280,u1563,m104,FRANK,"Senator Long set your boss up, my friend."
53124,L328279,u1558,m104,BILL,"Frank, I don't want to hear it."
53125,L328278,u1563,m104,FRANK,"You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison."
53126,L328277,u1558,m104,BILL,"Yeah, I guess you do."
53127,L328276,u1563,m104,FRANK,"Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office"
53128,L328275,u1558,m104,BILL,Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
53129,L328274,u1563,m104,FRANK,"It's you I want to talk to, Bill."
53130,L328273,u1558,m104,BILL,"Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed."
53131,L328272,u1563,m104,FRANK,Bill.
53132,L328447,u1574,m104,LOU,You're not digging.
53133,L328446,u1558,m104,BILL,Keep saying what?
53134,L328445,u1574,m104,LOU,You know you keep saying that.
53135,L328444,u1558,m104,BILL,"...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's..."
53136,L328443,u1558,m104,BILL,Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
53137,L328266,u1558,m104,BILL,"With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not..."
53138,L328265,u1574,m104,LOU,Not unless we go for Shaw now.
53139,L328264,u1558,m104,BILL,"The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case."
53140,L328248,u1574,m104,LOU,Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
53141,L328247,u1558,m104,BILL,"It's addressed to no one and no signature.  ""To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."""
53142,L327842,u1558,m104,BILL,"You, Numa?"
53143,L327841,u1574,m104,LOU,"I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers."
53144,L327840,u1558,m104,BILL,"What do you think, Lou?"
53145,L327612,u1558,m104,BILL,"Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go."
53146,L327611,u1574,m104,LOU,Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
53147,L327987,u1580,m104,MOBSTER,Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
53148,L327986,u1558,m104,BILL,So why does he call himself Bertrand?
53149,L327985,u1580,m104,MOBSTER,"Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy."
53150,L327984,u1558,m104,BILL,Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
53151,L327983,u1580,m104,MOBSTER,Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
53152,L327982,u1558,m104,BILL,What's the other name?
53153,L327981,u1580,m104,MOBSTER,"I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here."
53154,L327980,u1558,m104,BILL,"Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk."
53155,L327979,u1580,m104,MOBSTER,Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
53156,L327925,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know ""beatnik"" type things."
53157,L327924,u1558,m104,BILL,"Go on, Willie."
53158,L327923,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger."
53159,L327916,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as..."
53160,L327915,u1558,m104,BILL,And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
53161,L327914,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer..."
53162,L327911,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for."
53163,L327910,u1558,m104,BILL,Did he pay you for this?
53164,L327907,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him."
53165,L327906,u1558,m104,BILL,"Clay Bertrand, Willie?"
53166,L328484,u1558,m104,BILL,"This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men."
53167,L328483,u1568,m104,JIM,"Julius Caesar:  ""Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men.""  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA..."
53168,L328482,u1558,m104,BILL,Yeah.
53169,L328481,u1568,m104,JIM,"With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?"
53170,L328480,u1558,m104,BILL,Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
53171,L328479,u1568,m104,JIM,"If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?"
53172,L328478,u1558,m104,BILL,"Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?"
53173,L328477,u1568,m104,JIM,"I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers."
53174,L328476,u1558,m104,BILL,"Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?"
53175,L328475,u1568,m104,JIM,"I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings."
53176,L328474,u1558,m104,BILL,"So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me."
53177,L328473,u1568,m104,JIM,"Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!"
53178,L328470,u1568,m104,JIM,There's a word - orders.
53179,L328469,u1558,m104,BILL,"I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?"
53180,L328271,u1568,m104,JIM,"I don't know, Bill, I just don't know."
53181,L328270,u1558,m104,BILL,"Where you going, boss?"
53182,L328269,u1568,m104,JIM,"All right, all right.  Break it up."
53183,L328257,u1568,m104,JIM,"Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one."
53184,L328256,u1558,m104,BILL,"Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  ""When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."""
53185,L328224,u1558,m104,BILL,"Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?"
53186,L328223,u1568,m104,JIM,"Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!"
53187,L328187,u1568,m104,JIM,"Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?"
53188,L328186,u1558,m104,BILL,"That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a ""White Paper"" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss..."
53189,L328002,u1568,m104,JIM,I think we should have him in for a little talk.
53190,L328001,u1558,m104,BILL,That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
53191,L328000,u1568,m104,JIM,Can you get some sworn statements?
53192,L327837,u1568,m104,JIM,"Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy."
53193,L327836,u1558,m104,BILL,"I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but..."
53194,L327833,u1568,m104,JIM,"To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks."
53195,L327832,u1558,m104,BILL,But why?
53196,L327831,u1568,m104,JIM,"It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - ""a patsy"".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, ""O.H. Lee"" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?"
53197,L327830,u1558,m104,BILL,He had his palm print on the weapon.
53198,L327829,u1568,m104,JIM,"I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day."
53199,L327828,u1558,m104,BILL,"And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!"
53200,L327827,u1568,m104,JIM,"We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying."
53201,L327826,u1558,m104,BILL,"I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?"
53202,L327761,u1558,m104,BILL,"Gee, thanks boss."
53203,L327760,u1568,m104,JIM,"The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know."
53204,L327759,u1558,m104,BILL,"And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief."
53205,L327758,u1568,m104,JIM,"When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter."
53206,L327757,u1558,m104,BILL,"He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand."
53207,L327756,u1568,m104,JIM,"Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight."
53208,L327755,u1558,m104,BILL,"Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss."
53209,L327710,u1568,m104,JIM,"No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?"
53210,L327709,u1558,m104,BILL,"Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming."
53211,L327697,u1568,m104,JIM,"Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?"
53212,L327696,u1558,m104,BILL,What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
53213,L327678,u1568,m104,JIM,"Old stains, Bill, but just as telling."
53214,L327677,u1558,m104,BILL,"At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss."
53215,L327676,u1568,m104,JIM,"Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?"
53216,L327567,u1558,m104,BILL,"The anonymous kind, Chief."
53217,L327566,u1568,m104,JIM,Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
53218,L328263,u1559,m104,CORONER,"If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim."
53219,L328262,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes."
53220,L328261,u1559,m104,CORONER,"Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?"
53221,L328260,u1568,m104,JIM,Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
53222,L328259,u1559,m104,CORONER,"He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain."
53223,L328258,u1568,m104,JIM,"Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?"
53224,L328246,u1559,m104,CORONER,"I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes."
53225,L328245,u1568,m104,JIM,"What's it look like, Nick?"
53226,L328616,u1565,m104,GOLDBERG,"Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea..."
53227,L328615,u1560,m104,DYMOND,I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
53228,L328614,u1565,m104,GOLDBERG,"Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent."
53229,L328613,u1560,m104,DYMOND,Why?
53230,L328612,u1565,m104,GOLDBERG,I did.
53231,L328611,u1560,m104,DYMOND,"Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?"
53232,L328642,u1560,m104,DYMOND,Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
53233,L328641,u1585,m104,SHAW,"No, I did not."
53234,L328640,u1560,m104,DYMOND,...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
53235,L328639,u1585,m104,SHAW,"No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown."
53236,L328638,u1560,m104,DYMOND,...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
53237,L328637,u1585,m104,SHAW,"No, I did not."
53238,L328636,u1560,m104,DYMOND,...ever called Dean Andrews?
53239,L328635,u1585,m104,SHAW,"No, I did not."
53240,L328634,u1560,m104,DYMOND,...Oswald?
53241,L328163,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out ""Alan Pope"" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called ""Mongoose""  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  ""Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."""
53242,L328162,u1574,m104,LOU,"What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?"
53243,L328147,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A ""wanna be,"" y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me."
53244,L328146,u1574,m104,LOU,What do you mean?
53245,L328145,u1561,m104,FERRIE,That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
53246,L328144,u1574,m104,LOU,"Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?"
53247,L328143,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?"
53248,L328142,u1574,m104,LOU,"Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I""m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready."
53249,L328134,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?"
53250,L328133,u1574,m104,LOU,"Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want."
53251,L328132,u1561,m104,FERRIE,I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
53252,L328122,u1561,m104,FERRIE,I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
53253,L328121,u1574,m104,LOU,Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
53254,L328120,u1561,m104,FERRIE,...give me protection?
53255,L328119,u1574,m104,LOU,"Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?"
53256,L328118,u1561,m104,FERRIE,The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
53257,L328117,u1574,m104,LOU,"Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name."
53258,L328116,u1561,m104,FERRIE,It leads farther than that.
53259,L328115,u1574,m104,LOU,"Dave, you know that's where this road leads."
53260,L328114,u1561,m104,FERRIE,You still questioning any Cubans?
53261,L328113,u1574,m104,LOU,What did they...
53262,L328112,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people."
53263,L328111,u1574,m104,LOU,"What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions."
53264,L328110,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man."
53265,L328109,u1574,m104,LOU,"Calm down, Dave, what?"
53266,L328108,u1561,m104,FERRIE,Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
53267,L328107,u1574,m104,LOU,"Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?"
53268,L328106,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?"
53269,L328105,u1574,m104,LOU,Dave?
53270,L328104,u1561,m104,FERRIE,You know damn well who it is.
53271,L328170,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls."
53272,L328169,u1568,m104,JIM,"Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then."
53273,L328168,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight."
53274,L328167,u1568,m104,JIM,"Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it."
53275,L328166,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn."
53276,L328165,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything."
53277,L328164,u1568,m104,JIM,Then who killed the President?
53278,L328161,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games."
53279,L328160,u1568,m104,JIM,What about Ruby?
53280,L328159,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Shaw's an ""untouchable"", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency."
53281,L328158,u1568,m104,JIM,And Shaw?
53282,L328157,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life."
53283,L328156,u1568,m104,JIM,"Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?"
53284,L328155,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure."
53285,L328154,u1568,m104,JIM,Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
53286,L328153,u1561,m104,FERRIE,Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
53287,L328152,u1568,m104,JIM,"Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator."
53288,L328149,u1561,m104,FERRIE,Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
53289,L328148,u1568,m104,JIM,"Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?"
53290,L328140,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track."
53291,L328139,u1568,m104,JIM,"I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?"
53292,L328138,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?"
53293,L328137,u1568,m104,JIM,"Who was paying you, Dave?"
53294,L328136,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files."
53295,L328135,u1568,m104,JIM,You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
53296,L327922,u1568,m104,JIM,"Would you say this ""Leon"" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?"
53297,L327921,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right."
53298,L327607,u1568,m104,JIM,"Dave, I find your story simply not believable."
53299,L327606,u1561,m104,FERRIE,Why?  What's wrong?
53300,L327605,u1568,m104,JIM,"I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI."
53301,L327604,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese."
53302,L327603,u1568,m104,JIM,"Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?"
53303,L327602,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds."
53304,L327601,u1568,m104,JIM,But the boys told us they didn't get any.
53305,L327600,u1561,m104,FERRIE,I believe the boys got a couple.
53306,L327599,u1568,m104,JIM,Did you bag any geese on this trip?
53307,L327598,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond."
53308,L327597,u1568,m104,JIM,And then Sunday?
53309,L327596,u1561,m104,FERRIE,No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
53310,L327595,u1568,m104,JIM,Why Galveston?
53311,L327594,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there."
53312,L327593,u1568,m104,JIM,I see.  And where did you drive?
53313,L327592,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad."
53314,L327591,u1568,m104,JIM,"Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?"
53315,L327590,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating."
53316,L327589,u1568,m104,JIM,What was so appealing about Houston?
53317,L327588,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston."
53318,L327587,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday."
53319,L327586,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"No, I never saw him before in my life."
53320,L327585,u1568,m104,JIM,I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
53321,L327584,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know."
53322,L327583,u1568,m104,JIM,"But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager."
53323,L327582,u1561,m104,FERRIE,That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
53324,L327581,u1568,m104,JIM,"How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well."
53325,L327580,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?"
53326,L327579,u1568,m104,JIM,"How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war."
53327,L327578,u1561,m104,FERRIE,"Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?"
53328,L327577,u1568,m104,JIM,"Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?"
53329,L328676,u1562,m104,FINCK,"Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case."
53330,L328675,u1568,m104,JIM,There were admirals.
53331,L328674,u1562,m104,FINCK,"No, because there were others.  There were admirals."
53332,L328673,u1568,m104,JIM,But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
53333,L328672,u1562,m104,FINCK,No.
53334,L328671,u1568,m104,JIM,But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
53335,L328670,u1562,m104,FINCK,"I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are."
53336,L328667,u1562,m104,FINCK,Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
53337,L328666,u1568,m104,JIM,"Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?"
53338,L328665,u1562,m104,FINCK,I had the cause of death.
53339,L328664,u1568,m104,JIM,"As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?"
53340,L328663,u1562,m104,FINCK,I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
53341,L328662,u1568,m104,JIM,"Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?"
53342,L328631,u1570,m104,JUDGE HAGGERTY,"Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury."
53343,L328630,u1564,m104,GARRISON,I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
53344,L328629,u1570,m104,JUDGE HAGGERTY,"If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway."
53345,L328628,u1564,m104,GARRISON,That's our case!
53346,L328627,u1570,m104,JUDGE HAGGERTY,"I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible."
53347,L328626,u1564,m104,GARRISON,"Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions."
53348,L328622,u1564,m104,GARRISON,What?
53349,L328621,u1570,m104,JUDGE HAGGERTY,I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
53350,L328556,u1568,m104,JIM,"There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared."
53351,L328555,u1566,m104,JASPER,I'm scared.
53352,L328551,u1568,m104,JIM,"No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us."
53353,L328550,u1566,m104,JASPER,"Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?"
53354,L328549,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well, it looks like it, Jasper."
53355,L328548,u1566,m104,JASPER,"Are we going away, Daddy?"
53356,L328077,u1568,m104,JIM,"Hi, Freckle Face."
53357,L328076,u1566,m104,JASPER,Daddy!  Where have you been?
53358,L327642,u1566,m104,JASPER,A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
53359,L327641,u1568,m104,JIM,"That's something, Jasper.  What is it?"
53360,L327640,u1566,m104,JASPER,"Dad, look what I drew."
53361,L327632,u1568,m104,JIM,"Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?"
53362,L327631,u1566,m104,JASPER,Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
53363,L328398,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish."
53364,L328397,u1571,m104,LAWYER,"Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is."
53365,L328396,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:"
53366,L328395,u1571,m104,LAWYER,I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
53367,L328394,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
53368,L328393,u1571,m104,LAWYER,...you heard echoes.
53369,L328392,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
53370,L328391,u1571,m104,LAWYER,I want the truth.
53371,L328390,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?"
53372,L328389,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted."
53373,L328388,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"No, you don't!"
53374,L328387,u1571,m104,LAWYER,"That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President."
53375,L328386,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me."
53376,L328385,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
53377,L328384,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital."
53378,L328383,u1576,m104,MAN,"We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?"
53379,L328382,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,"No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?"
53380,L328381,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
53381,L328380,u1576,m104,MAN,That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
53382,L328379,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,Four to six.
53383,L328378,u1576,m104,MAN,How many shots you say you heard?
53384,L328377,u1567,m104,JEAN HILL,These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
53385,L328578,u1568,m104,JIM,I know.
53386,L328577,u1586,m104,SUSIE,I'm sorry.
53387,L328499,u1568,m104,JIM,"No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?"
53388,L328498,u1586,m104,SUSIE,Aren't you being a little hard?
53389,L328449,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald."
53390,L328448,u1568,m104,JIM,"I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill."
53391,L328238,u1586,m104,SUSIE,Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
53392,L328237,u1568,m104,JIM,I don't believe it!
53393,L327989,u1568,m104,JIM,"Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word ""microdots"" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for..."
53394,L327988,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name ""Oswald"" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name ""Oswald"" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity."
53395,L327821,u1568,m104,JIM,"I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying ""We both know who's responsible.""  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?"
53396,L327820,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him."
53397,L327819,u1568,m104,JIM,Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
53398,L327818,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence."
53399,L327808,u1586,m104,SUSIE,Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
53400,L327807,u1568,m104,JIM,Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
53401,L327806,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency."
53402,L327805,u1568,m104,JIM,"Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that."
53403,L327804,u1586,m104,SUSIE,None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
53404,L327803,u1568,m104,JIM,And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
53405,L327802,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group."
53406,L327801,u1568,m104,JIM,But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
53407,L327800,u1586,m104,SUSIE,The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
53408,L327799,u1568,m104,JIM,This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
53409,L327798,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA."
53410,L327797,u1568,m104,JIM,Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
53411,L327791,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter."
53412,L327790,u1568,m104,JIM,Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
53413,L327789,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls."
53414,L327782,u1586,m104,SUSIE,"Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange."
53415,L327781,u1568,m104,JIM,"If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?"
53416,L328072,u1585,m104,SHAW,"Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!"
53417,L328071,u1568,m104,JIM,"I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president."
53418,L328070,u1585,m104,SHAW,"May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost."
53419,L328069,u1568,m104,JIM,"No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops."
53420,L328068,u1585,m104,SHAW,"And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?"
53421,L328067,u1568,m104,JIM,"Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?"
53422,L328066,u1585,m104,SHAW,"Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world."
53423,L328065,u1568,m104,JIM,"...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans..."
53424,L328064,u1585,m104,SHAW,Nonsense.  What next?
53425,L328063,u1568,m104,JIM,It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
53426,L328062,u1585,m104,SHAW,I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
53427,L328061,u1568,m104,JIM,"Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities."
53428,L328060,u1585,m104,SHAW,"Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste."
53429,L328059,u1568,m104,JIM,Please answer the question.
53430,L328058,u1585,m104,SHAW,"You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison."
53431,L328057,u1568,m104,JIM,"Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?"
53432,L328056,u1585,m104,SHAW,"Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?"
53433,L328055,u1568,m104,JIM,"Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?"
53434,L328048,u1585,m104,SHAW,"One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews."
53435,L328047,u1568,m104,JIM,"No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?"
53436,L328046,u1585,m104,SHAW,Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
53437,L328045,u1568,m104,JIM,Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
53438,L328044,u1585,m104,SHAW,No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
53439,L328043,u1568,m104,JIM,Let me show you his picture.
53440,L328040,u1568,m104,JIM,...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
53441,L328039,u1585,m104,SHAW,No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
53442,L328038,u1568,m104,JIM,David Ferrie.
53443,L328037,u1585,m104,SHAW,Who?
53444,L328036,u1568,m104,JIM,"...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man..."
53445,L328035,u1585,m104,SHAW,"Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know."
53446,L328034,u1568,m104,JIM,After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
53447,L328033,u1585,m104,SHAW,"It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering ""Frankie!"" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?"
53448,L328032,u1568,m104,JIM,I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
53449,L328031,u1585,m104,SHAW,"Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it."
53450,L328030,u1568,m104,JIM,Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
53451,L328028,u1568,m104,JIM,Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
53452,L328027,u1585,m104,SHAW,"No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name."
53453,L328026,u1568,m104,JIM,A Willie O'Keefe?
53454,L328025,u1585,m104,SHAW,No.
53455,L328024,u1568,m104,JIM,A Perry Russo?
53456,L328023,u1585,m104,SHAW,No.  Never heard of him.
53457,L328022,u1568,m104,JIM,We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
53458,L328021,u1585,m104,SHAW,I wouldn't imagine where.
53459,L328020,u1568,m104,JIM,Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
53460,L328019,u1585,m104,SHAW,I'm not sure I understand.
53461,L328346,u1578,m104,MERCER,"I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job."
53462,L328345,u1568,m104,JIM,"Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this."
53463,L328344,u1578,m104,MERCER,"This says ""Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck.""  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all..."
53464,L328343,u1578,m104,MERCER,"That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements..."
53465,L328342,u1568,m104,JIM,But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
53466,L328341,u1578,m104,MERCER,"That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, ""that was the man I saw in the truck."""
53467,L328340,u1568,m104,JIM,"You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?"
53468,L328332,u1578,m104,MERCER,"Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day."
53469,L328331,u1568,m104,JIM,"In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that..."
53470,L328598,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!"
53471,L328597,u1568,m104,JIM,He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
53472,L328596,u1572,m104,LIZ,Huh?
53473,L328595,u1568,m104,JIM,"They killed him, honey."
53474,L328591,u1572,m104,LIZ,"I don't think so, Jim..."
53475,L328590,u1568,m104,JIM,"I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?"
53476,L328589,u1572,m104,LIZ,And if you're wrong?
53477,L328546,u1572,m104,LIZ,"You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am."
53478,L328545,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and ""I'm jes fine honey.""  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not ""fine"" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away."
53479,L328544,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!"
53480,L328543,u1568,m104,JIM,That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
53481,L328542,u1572,m104,LIZ,"I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid ""trial""! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?"
53482,L328541,u1568,m104,JIM,"Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?"
53483,L328540,u1572,m104,LIZ,"I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed."
53484,L328539,u1568,m104,JIM,"Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz."
53485,L328538,u1572,m104,LIZ,Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
53486,L328537,u1568,m104,JIM,I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
53487,L328536,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you."
53488,L328535,u1568,m104,JIM,"I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself."
53489,L328534,u1572,m104,LIZ,You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
53490,L328533,u1568,m104,JIM,"Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of."
53491,L328532,u1572,m104,LIZ,I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
53492,L328531,u1568,m104,JIM,Get a hold of yourself.
53493,L328530,u1572,m104,LIZ,"How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!"
53494,L328529,u1568,m104,JIM,"Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen."
53495,L328528,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!"
53496,L328527,u1568,m104,JIM,Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
53497,L328526,u1572,m104,LIZ,Your daughter's life was just threatened!
53498,L328525,u1568,m104,JIM,"Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!"
53499,L328524,u1572,m104,LIZ,A man just called.  He asked her everything!
53500,L328523,u1568,m104,JIM,What?
53501,L328522,u1572,m104,LIZ,Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
53502,L328131,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou."
53503,L328130,u1568,m104,JIM,Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
53504,L328127,u1568,m104,JIM,"Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing."
53505,L328126,u1572,m104,LIZ,"It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared."
53506,L328125,u1568,m104,JIM,Did they live?
53507,L328087,u1568,m104,JIM,"It's going to get worse, honey."
53508,L328086,u1572,m104,LIZ,"That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day."
53509,L328085,u1568,m104,JIM,"I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis."
53510,L328084,u1572,m104,LIZ,"I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, ""Where's Daddy?""  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!"
53511,L328083,u1568,m104,JIM,I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
53512,L328082,u1572,m104,LIZ,"We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim."
53513,L328081,u1568,m104,JIM,"Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected."
53514,L328080,u1572,m104,LIZ,My sympathies.
53515,L328079,u1568,m104,JIM,Tough day.
53516,L328078,u1572,m104,LIZ,Hi.
53517,L328016,u1568,m104,JIM,"Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me."
53518,L328015,u1572,m104,LIZ,"You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey."
53519,L328014,u1568,m104,JIM,"I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry."
53520,L328013,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday."
53521,L328012,u1568,m104,JIM,"Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?"
53522,L328011,u1572,m104,LIZ,But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
53523,L328010,u1568,m104,JIM,No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
53524,L328007,u1568,m104,JIM,"You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning."
53525,L328006,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg."
53526,L328004,u1568,m104,JIM,"It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen."
53527,L328003,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim."
53528,L327674,u1568,m104,JIM,Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
53529,L327673,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Honey, go back to sleep, please!"
53530,L327672,u1568,m104,JIM,"Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian."
53531,L327671,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?"
53532,L327670,u1568,m104,JIM,"And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  ""He only had two more Russian words right than wrong.""  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess."
53533,L327669,u1572,m104,LIZ,"These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them."
53534,L327668,u1568,m104,JIM,"Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas."
53535,L327667,u1572,m104,LIZ,"I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ..."
53536,L327666,u1568,m104,JIM,"It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!"
53537,L327665,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Honey, you all right?"
53538,L327647,u1568,m104,JIM,"Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented."
53539,L327646,u1572,m104,LIZ,"One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man."
53540,L327639,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy."
53541,L327638,u1568,m104,JIM,I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
53542,L327630,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?"
53543,L327629,u1568,m104,JIM,"Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court."
53544,L327628,u1572,m104,LIZ,"Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner."
53545,L327953,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change."
53546,L327952,u1568,m104,JIM,"No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this."
53547,L327951,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is..."
53548,L327950,u1568,m104,JIM,"You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people."
53549,L327949,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so."
53550,L327948,u1568,m104,JIM,"Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?"
53551,L327913,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63."
53552,L327912,u1568,m104,JIM,"Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?"
53553,L327909,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,Well... yeah.
53554,L327908,u1568,m104,JIM,For sexual purposes?
53555,L327905,u1582,m104,O'KEEFE,"Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road..."
53556,L327904,u1568,m104,JIM,"I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time."
53557,L328497,u1574,m104,LOU,You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
53558,L328496,u1568,m104,JIM,"I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation."
53559,L328495,u1574,m104,LOU,"Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss."
53560,L328494,u1568,m104,JIM,"Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?"
53561,L328493,u1574,m104,LOU,"Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill."
53562,L328492,u1568,m104,JIM,"Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that..."
53563,L328491,u1574,m104,LOU,I just plain don't trust him anymore.
53564,L328486,u1568,m104,JIM,We need him back.
53565,L328485,u1574,m104,LOU,"Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything."
53566,L328431,u1574,m104,LOU,"You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong."
53567,L328430,u1568,m104,JIM,"Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about."
53568,L328429,u1574,m104,LOU,"They're gonna love you, chief."
53569,L328428,u1568,m104,JIM,"Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou."
53570,L328427,u1574,m104,LOU,Allen Dulles?
53571,L328426,u1568,m104,JIM,His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
53572,L328425,u1574,m104,LOU,The Warren Commission call him?
53573,L328424,u1568,m104,JIM,"General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a ""traitor"".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw."
53574,L328423,u1574,m104,LOU,Who?
53575,L328422,u1568,m104,JIM,Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
53576,L328421,u1574,m104,LOU,No.
53577,L328420,u1568,m104,JIM,You know who the mayor was?
53578,L328419,u1574,m104,LOU,"Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, ""and afterwards there's only the freeway,"" and went home."
53579,L328418,u1568,m104,JIM,Who do you think changed the parade route?
53580,L328415,u1574,m104,LOU,"One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... ""3-2-1...  green!""  Or else ""Abort!  Abort!"""
53581,L328414,u1568,m104,JIM,How many men?
53582,L328413,u1574,m104,LOU,"When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot."
53583,L328410,u1568,m104,JIM,Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
53584,L328409,u1574,m104,LOU,That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
53585,L328408,u1568,m104,JIM,"The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it."
53586,L328407,u1574,m104,LOU,"It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public."
53587,L328406,u1568,m104,JIM,Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
53588,L328405,u1574,m104,LOU,"The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film."
53589,L328404,u1568,m104,JIM,Between six and seven seconds.
53590,L328403,u1574,m104,LOU,Time?
53591,L328252,u1574,m104,LOU,I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
53592,L328251,u1568,m104,JIM,"I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?"
53593,L328231,u1574,m104,LOU,"I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!"
53594,L328230,u1568,m104,JIM,"I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow."
53595,L328229,u1574,m104,LOU,"You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time."
53596,L328090,u1574,m104,LOU,"And it ain't pretty  ...""the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966."
53597,L328089,u1568,m104,JIM,Goddamn Sam!
53598,L327992,u1568,m104,JIM,"I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything."
53599,L327991,u1574,m104,LOU,"Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars."
53600,L327835,u1568,m104,JIM,"Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up."
53601,L327834,u1574,m104,LOU,"I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced."
53602,L327779,u1574,m104,LOU,"Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run."
53603,L327778,u1568,m104,JIM,Can we find her?
53604,L327777,u1574,m104,LOU,There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
53605,L327776,u1568,m104,JIM,"We need to find more witnesses, Lou."
53606,L327775,u1574,m104,LOU,"Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died."
53607,L327773,u1574,m104,LOU,"...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops."
53608,L327772,u1568,m104,JIM,Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
53609,L327771,u1574,m104,LOU,"...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?"
53610,L327770,u1574,m104,LOU,A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
53611,L327769,u1568,m104,JIM,I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
53612,L327768,u1574,m104,LOU,"They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned."
53613,L327708,u1568,m104,JIM,"We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records..."
53614,L327707,u1574,m104,LOU,"What are you driving at, boss?"
53615,L327706,u1568,m104,JIM,"Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?"
53616,L327704,u1574,m104,LOU,"""Once ONI, always ONI""?"
53617,L327703,u1568,m104,JIM,"Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?"
53618,L327702,u1574,m104,LOU,Post Office.
53619,L327701,u1568,m104,JIM,Take a look across the street.
53620,L327700,u1574,m104,LOU,The Office of Naval Intelligence.
53621,L327699,u1568,m104,JIM,"Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?"
53622,L327698,u1574,m104,LOU,I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
53623,L327680,u1574,m104,LOU,"Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago."
53624,L327679,u1568,m104,JIM,Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
53625,L327560,u1574,m104,LOU,"He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy."
53626,L327559,u1568,m104,JIM,I know David - a strange character.
53627,L327521,u1568,m104,JIM,"Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war."
53628,L327520,u1574,m104,LOU,One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
53629,L327494,u1574,m104,LOU,No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
53630,L327493,u1568,m104,JIM,Oh no!... How bad?
53631,L327492,u1574,m104,LOU,"Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago."
53632,L327491,u1568,m104,JIM,"What's wrong, Lou?"
53633,L327627,u1573,m104,LONG,"Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!"
53634,L327626,u1568,m104,JIM,"Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true."
53635,L327625,u1573,m104,LONG,"Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome."
53636,L327624,u1568,m104,JIM,"You think there were other men involved, Russell?"
53637,L327623,u1573,m104,LONG,"If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  ""I'm just a patsy.""  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me."
53638,L327622,u1568,m104,JIM,"You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it."
53639,L327621,u1573,m104,LONG,"Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One ""pristine"" bullet?  That dog don't hunt."
53640,L327620,u1568,m104,JIM,I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
53641,L327618,u1573,m104,LONG,Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
53642,L327617,u1568,m104,JIM,"I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator."
53643,L327616,u1573,m104,LONG,"Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? ""Love Child.""  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House."
53644,L328572,u1569,m104,JOHNSON,"No, it can't!"
53645,L328571,u1568,m104,JIM,Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
53646,L328570,u1569,m104,JOHNSON,Pictures like this don't show up on television!
53647,L328568,u1568,m104,JIM,"That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about."
53648,L328567,u1569,m104,JOHNSON,Are they?  Why would they?
53649,L328566,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?"
53650,L328565,u1569,m104,JOHNSON,Some people would say you're paranoid.
53651,L328564,u1568,m104,JIM,"Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to..."
53652,L328563,u1569,m104,JOHNSON,"There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?"
53653,L328560,u1568,m104,JIM,"I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like."
53654,L328559,u1569,m104,JOHNSON,"Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?"
53655,L328786,u1588,m104,X,"I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge."
53656,L328785,u1568,m104,JIM,"Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier..."
53657,L328784,u1588,m104,X,It never did.
53658,L328783,u1568,m104,JIM,...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
53659,L328782,u1588,m104,X,"I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say ""protection"" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of ""okay"" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again."
53660,L328781,u1588,m104,X,Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
53661,L328780,u1568,m104,JIM,His name?
53662,L328779,u1588,m104,X,You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
53663,L328778,u1568,m104,JIM,Ever ask him?
53664,L328777,u1588,m104,X,"...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket..."
53665,L328776,u1568,m104,JIM,...and your General?
53666,L328775,u1588,m104,X,"...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it."
53667,L328774,u1568,m104,JIM,Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
53668,L328773,u1588,m104,X,"He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone..."
53669,L328755,u1588,m104,X,"I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now."
53670,L328754,u1568,m104,JIM,"Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?"
53671,L328753,u1588,m104,X,"You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?"
53672,L328752,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well, thanks for coming."
53673,L328309,u1588,m104,X,"But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break..."
53674,L328308,u1568,m104,JIM,I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
53675,L328307,u1588,m104,X,"No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic."
53676,L328306,u1568,m104,JIM,The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
53677,L328305,u1588,m104,X,"Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking."
53678,L328304,u1568,m104,JIM,I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
53679,L328290,u1588,m104,X,"I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think..."
53680,L328289,u1568,m104,JIM,"I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't..."
53681,L328288,u1588,m104,X,"I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X."
53682,L328287,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr..."
53683,L328286,u1588,m104,X,I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
53684,L328285,u1568,m104,JIM,Yes.
53685,L328284,u1588,m104,X,Jim Garrison?
53686,L327754,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"You're so naive, mister."
53687,L327753,u1568,m104,JIM,"Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack."
53688,L327752,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go."
53689,L327751,u1568,m104,JIM,"Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?"
53690,L327750,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say."
53691,L327749,u1568,m104,JIM,"The assassination, Jack?"
53692,L327748,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but..."
53693,L327747,u1568,m104,JIM,"Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?"
53694,L327746,u1577,m104,MARTIN,Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
53695,L327745,u1568,m104,JIM,Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
53696,L327744,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Clay something, that was his name - Clay."
53697,L327742,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him."
53698,L327741,u1568,m104,JIM,Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
53699,L327737,u1568,m104,JIM,"Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important."
53700,L327736,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right."
53701,L327735,u1568,m104,JIM,And Oswald?
53702,L327734,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse."
53703,L327732,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest."
53704,L327731,u1568,m104,JIM,Where is Banister in all this?
53705,L327728,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives."
53706,L327727,u1568,m104,JIM,Was he there often?
53707,L327726,u1577,m104,MARTIN,Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
53708,L327725,u1577,m104,MARTIN,"Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me."
53709,L327724,u1568,m104,JIM,"Why did Guy beat you, Jack?"
53710,L327723,u1577,m104,MARTIN,I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
53711,L327722,u1568,m104,JIM,You have other information?
53712,L327721,u1577,m104,MARTIN,If you buy what you read in the paper.
53713,L327720,u1568,m104,JIM,"Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?"
53714,L327719,u1577,m104,MARTIN,I don't know if I should talk about this.
53715,L327718,u1568,m104,JIM,How much more?
53716,L327716,u1568,m104,JIM,"Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?"
53717,L327715,u1577,m104,MARTIN,Never touched me.
53718,L327714,u1568,m104,JIM,And he never hit you before?
53719,L327713,u1577,m104,MARTIN,More than ten years.
53720,L327712,u1568,m104,JIM,"Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?"
53721,L328588,u1568,m104,JIM,"It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow."
53722,L328587,u1581,m104,NUMA,Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
53723,L328586,u1568,m104,JIM,"I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, ""The Old Man and the Sea""?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton."
53724,L328584,u1568,m104,JIM,"He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President."
53725,L328583,u1581,m104,NUMA,Sure sounds like he's winning.
53726,L328442,u1568,m104,JIM,"I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?"
53727,L328441,u1581,m104,NUMA,Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
53728,L328440,u1568,m104,JIM,I just don't want to do it.  What else?
53729,L328439,u1581,m104,NUMA,She's the best damn witness we have!
53730,L328438,u1568,m104,JIM,"No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people."
53731,L328241,u1568,m104,JIM,"Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington."
53732,L328240,u1581,m104,NUMA,"Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be..."
53733,L328233,u1568,m104,JIM,"You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when..."
53734,L328232,u1581,m104,NUMA,"HOLD IT, CHIEF..."
53735,L327994,u1568,m104,JIM,"Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery."
53736,L327993,u1581,m104,NUMA,"Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?"
53737,L327793,u1568,m104,JIM,"It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets."
53738,L327792,u1581,m104,NUMA,Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
53739,L328218,u1568,m104,JIM,How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
53740,L328217,u1579,m104,MILLER,"Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning."
53741,L328216,u1568,m104,JIM,And what would I have to do?
53742,L328215,u1579,m104,MILLER,"I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?"
53743,L328214,u1579,m104,MILLER,"Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest."
53744,L328213,u1568,m104,JIM,The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
53745,L328212,u1579,m104,MILLER,"I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops."
53746,L328209,u1568,m104,JIM,That's it.
53747,L328208,u1579,m104,MILLER,That's all you've had all this time?
53748,L328207,u1568,m104,JIM,Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
53749,L328206,u1579,m104,MILLER,How many men are working with you on this?
53750,L328205,u1568,m104,JIM,"If you must know, virtually nothing."
53751,L328204,u1579,m104,MILLER,I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
53752,L328203,u1568,m104,JIM,I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
53753,L328202,u1579,m104,MILLER,You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
53754,L328201,u1568,m104,JIM,Germany.
53755,L328200,u1579,m104,MILLER,"Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?"
53756,L328199,u1579,m104,MILLER,"Splendid, love to see them."
53757,L328198,u1568,m104,JIM,They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
53758,L328197,u1568,m104,JIM,We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
53759,L328196,u1579,m104,MILLER,"I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say."
53760,L328195,u1568,m104,JIM,"Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there."
53761,L328194,u1579,m104,MILLER,I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
53762,L328193,u1579,m104,MILLER,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it."
53763,L328192,u1568,m104,JIM,"Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?"
53764,L328515,u1587,m104,VIRGINIA,Uh huh.
53765,L328514,u1575,m104,MALE VOICE,Do you walk home?
53766,L328513,u1587,m104,VIRGINIA,Yes.
53767,L328512,u1575,m104,MALE VOICE,And you get of from school at 3 every day?
53768,L328510,u1575,m104,MALE VOICE,And how tall are you?
53769,L328509,u1587,m104,VIRGINIA,Six.
53770,L328508,u1575,m104,MALE VOICE,I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
53771,L328507,u1587,m104,VIRGINIA,That sounds fun.
53772,L328506,u1575,m104,MALE VOICE,"Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?"
53773,L328505,u1587,m104,VIRGINIA,Virginia.
53774,L328504,u1575,m104,MALE VOICE,Virginia or Elizabeth?
53775,L328503,u1587,m104,VIRGINIA,Yes?
53776,L328502,u1575,m104,MALE VOICE,Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
53777,L327860,u1584,m104,RUBY,"Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world."
53778,L327859,u1583,m104,OFFICIAL,"Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter."
53779,L327858,u1584,m104,RUBY,"But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?"
53780,L327857,u1583,m104,OFFICIAL,"Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby."
53781,L327856,u1584,m104,RUBY,What are they?
53782,L327855,u1583,m104,OFFICIAL,"No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that."
53783,L327854,u1584,m104,RUBY,"Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?"
53784,L327853,u1583,m104,OFFICIAL,I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
53785,L327852,u1584,m104,RUBY,"When are you going back to Washington, sir?"
53786,L327851,u1583,m104,OFFICIAL,"Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now."
53787,L327850,u1584,m104,RUBY,Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
53788,L313917,u1589,m105,AMY,"Oh, that's not a problem."
53789,L313916,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform."
53790,L313904,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Thanks.
53791,L313903,u1589,m105,AMY,Not a problem.
53792,L313902,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
53793,L313901,u1589,m105,AMY,"Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit."
53794,L313900,u1593,m105,JACKIE,This looks pretty good on me.
53795,L313898,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on."
53796,L313897,u1589,m105,AMY,Can I help you?
53797,L313104,u1595,m105,MAX,I won't forget.
53798,L313103,u1590,m105,ANITA,Won't forget?
53799,L313102,u1595,m105,MAX,I'll call her.
53800,L313101,u1590,m105,ANITA,So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
53801,L313099,u1590,m105,ANITA,"Yes, Max, I understand."
53802,L313098,u1595,m105,MAX,"Then say ""Yes, Max. I understand."""
53803,L313097,u1590,m105,ANITA,I understand.
53804,L313096,u1595,m105,MAX,I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
53805,L313095,u1590,m105,ANITA,I understand.
53806,L313094,u1595,m105,MAX,"I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?"
53807,L313093,u1590,m105,ANITA,"Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go."
53808,L313092,u1595,m105,MAX,But then you told her you were home.
53809,L313091,u1590,m105,ANITA,I know. That's why I went.
53810,L313090,u1595,m105,MAX,"But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would."
53811,L313089,u1590,m105,ANITA,I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
53812,L313088,u1595,m105,MAX,"Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral"
53813,L312938,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat."
53814,L312937,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,Course you didn't.
53815,L312936,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?"
53816,L312935,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
53817,L312934,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car."
53818,L312933,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk."
53819,L312932,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"Look, man, I know I owe you --"
53820,L312931,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --"
53821,L312930,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
53822,L312929,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I can't believe you do me this way.
53823,L312928,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk."
53824,L312927,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
53825,L312926,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
53826,L312925,u1598,m105,ORDELL,We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
53827,L312924,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
53828,L312923,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
53829,L312922,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody."
53830,L312920,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,Go ahead.
53831,L312919,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Let me finish. Can I finish?
53832,L312918,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --"
53833,L312917,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup."
53834,L312916,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,Uh-huh.
53835,L312915,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?"
53836,L312914,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,What's the problem?
53837,L312913,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me."
53838,L312912,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --"
53839,L312911,u1598,m105,ORDELL,A bit.
53840,L312910,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,That requires me goin' out tonight?
53841,L312909,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I need a favor.
53842,L312908,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,What?
53843,L312907,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga."
53844,L312906,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,What'd ya mean?
53845,L312905,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me."
53846,L312904,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV."
53847,L312902,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"That's why they call it ""fuckin' with ya."" Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?"
53848,L312901,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,That's not what they're tellin' me.
53849,L312900,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?"
53850,L312899,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,Three years.
53851,L312898,u1598,m105,ORDELL,How old is that machine gun shit?
53852,L312897,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it."
53853,L312896,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass."
53854,L312895,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time."
53855,L312894,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work."
53856,L312892,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,You.
53857,L312891,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Who?
53858,L312890,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,You were there for me.
53859,L312889,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Who was there for your ass?
53860,L312888,u1591,m105,BEAUMONT,"What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you."
53861,L314212,u1595,m105,MAX,"I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him."
53862,L314211,u1592,m105,DARGUS,And you didn't tell the Police?
53863,L314210,u1595,m105,MAX,I found out.
53864,L314209,u1592,m105,DARGUS,How'd you know where he was?
53865,L314208,u1595,m105,MAX,"I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here."
53866,L314207,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Why were you with him?
53867,L314206,u1595,m105,MAX,In his inside coat pocket.
53868,L314205,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Does he have the marked bills on him?
53869,L314075,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Sure.
53870,L314074,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Can I have a word with you?
53871,L313640,u1592,m105,DARGUS,What time do you have to be there?
53872,L313639,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it."
53873,L313638,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
53874,L313637,u1592,m105,DARGUS,We are. Don't worry about it.
53875,L313345,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her."
53876,L313344,u1597,m105,NICOLET,She knows it's my case?
53877,L313343,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you."
53878,L313342,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What's she willing to give us?
53879,L313341,u1592,m105,DARGUS,She wants to go back to work.
53880,L313340,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What's she want?
53881,L313339,u1592,m105,DARGUS,She almost sounds scared.
53882,L313338,u1597,m105,NICOLET,She sound scared?
53883,L313337,u1592,m105,DARGUS,She wants to make a deal.
53884,L313336,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What's going on?
53885,L313329,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Hey, Jackie."
53886,L313328,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"Great, you're here."
53887,L312994,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
53888,L312993,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
53889,L312992,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You got a good lawyer?
53890,L312983,u1597,m105,NICOLET,That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
53891,L312982,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?"
53892,L313645,u1593,m105,JACKIE,But you're not going to stop her?
53893,L313644,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"She leaves, somebody'll be on her."
53894,L313643,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
53895,L313642,u1592,m105,DARGUS,What's her name?
53896,L313641,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
53897,L313632,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Bet you're happy to be working again.
53898,L313631,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Fine.
53899,L313630,u1592,m105,DARGUS,How was your flight?
53900,L313367,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Can you do it or not?
53901,L313366,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"You don't want much, do you?"
53902,L313357,u1593,m105,JACKIE,'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
53903,L313356,u1592,m105,DARGUS,But now you're telling us now you do.
53904,L313353,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Help you get Ordell Robbie.
53905,L313352,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Help us do what?
53906,L313332,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Thanks.
53907,L313331,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Take your time.
53908,L313330,u1592,m105,DARGUS,Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
53909,L313022,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit."
53910,L313021,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic."
53911,L313011,u1593,m105,JACKIE,That's my diet shit.
53912,L313010,u1592,m105,DARGUS,What's this?
53913,L313008,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Beauty products.
53914,L313007,u1592,m105,DARGUS,What's in it?
53915,L313006,u1593,m105,JACKIE,My pocketbook.
53916,L313005,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?"
53917,L313004,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Help yourself.
53918,L313001,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?"
53919,L313000,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'm not a loser.
53920,L312990,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Arrest me.
53921,L312989,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking."
53922,L312987,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'm not saying another word.
53923,L312986,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?"
53924,L312985,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"If I were to tell you ""no it isn't..."""
53925,L312984,u1592,m105,DARGUS,This is your money?
53926,L312979,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Suspicion of what?
53927,L312978,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"You have the right to say ""no."" And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion."
53928,L312977,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
53929,L312976,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?"
53930,L312975,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
53931,L312973,u1593,m105,JACKIE,The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
53932,L312972,u1592,m105,DARGUS,"Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?"
53933,L314256,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Are you scared of me?
53934,L314255,u1595,m105,MAX,I'm just tired in general.
53935,L314254,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I thought you were tired of your business?
53936,L314253,u1595,m105,MAX,"Thank you for saying that, but no. My business."
53937,L314252,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Sure I can't twist your arm?
53938,L314251,u1595,m105,MAX,"Thanks, but you have a good time."
53939,L314250,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Wanna go?
53940,L314248,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
53941,L314247,u1595,m105,MAX,Madrid or Barcelona?
53942,L314246,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Spain.
53943,L314245,u1595,m105,MAX,Where're you going?
53944,L314244,u1595,m105,MAX,You'll get over that.
53945,L314243,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
53946,L314242,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Do you blame yourself for helping me?
53947,L314241,u1595,m105,MAX,I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
53948,L314240,u1593,m105,JACKIE,We're partners.
53949,L314239,u1595,m105,MAX,I know.
53950,L314238,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I never lied to you.
53951,L314237,u1595,m105,MAX,I didn't say you did.
53952,L314236,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I didn't use you, Max."
53953,L314235,u1595,m105,MAX,Not after they're dead.
53954,L314234,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?"
53955,L314233,u1595,m105,MAX,That's Ordell's.
53956,L314232,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I told him I might.
53957,L314231,u1595,m105,MAX,Did you tell him you were leaving?
53958,L314230,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is ""woefully and wantonly"" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does."
53959,L314229,u1595,m105,MAX,What's he doing?
53960,L314228,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
53961,L314225,u1595,m105,MAX,I'm sure.
53962,L314224,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
53963,L314223,u1595,m105,MAX,I hesitated taking that much.
53964,L314222,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Only this isn't a bail bond, Max."
53965,L314221,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note."
53966,L314220,u1595,m105,MAX,Less ten percent.
53967,L314219,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
53968,L314137,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?"
53969,L314136,u1595,m105,MAX,What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
53970,L314135,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He's already there.
53971,L314134,u1595,m105,MAX,"We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?"
53972,L314133,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
53973,L314132,u1595,m105,MAX,What do you tell Nicolet?
53974,L314131,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
53975,L314130,u1595,m105,MAX,Why?
53976,L314129,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Tell him I want to give him his money.
53977,L314128,u1595,m105,MAX,Tell him you want to see him?
53978,L314127,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
53979,L314126,u1595,m105,MAX,Set him up.
53980,L314125,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Get Ordell to come to your office.
53981,L314124,u1595,m105,MAX,So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
53982,L314123,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell."
53983,L314122,u1595,m105,MAX,It's not that simple.
53984,L314121,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?"
53985,L314120,u1595,m105,MAX,"Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory."
53986,L314119,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Ray wants him.
53987,L314118,u1595,m105,MAX,On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
53988,L314117,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He's liable to shoot you.
53989,L314116,u1595,m105,MAX,"People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me."
53990,L314115,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
53991,L314114,u1595,m105,MAX,All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
53992,L314113,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How'd you find out?
53993,L313851,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on."
53994,L313850,u1595,m105,MAX,In a dress.
53995,L313849,u1593,m105,JACKIE,That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
53996,L313848,u1595,m105,MAX,You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
53997,L313847,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried."
53998,L313846,u1595,m105,MAX,Then you're out and you get nothing.
53999,L313845,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke."
54000,L313844,u1595,m105,MAX,You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
54001,L313843,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top."
54002,L313842,u1595,m105,MAX,What if he checks it?
54003,L313841,u1593,m105,JACKIE,In the bag underneath.
54004,L313840,u1595,m105,MAX,Where's the rest of it?
54005,L313839,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand."
54006,L313838,u1595,m105,MAX,But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
54007,L313837,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
54008,L313836,u1595,m105,MAX,It'll be more than that.
54009,L313834,u1593,m105,JACKIE,All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
54010,L313833,u1595,m105,MAX,"You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit."
54011,L313832,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them."
54012,L313831,u1595,m105,MAX,Do you think they bought it?
54013,L313830,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
54014,L313677,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you."
54015,L313676,u1595,m105,MAX,You're rationalizing.
54016,L313654,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money."
54017,L313653,u1595,m105,MAX,The feds. It's evidence.
54018,L313627,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What if I've figured a way?
54019,L313626,u1595,m105,MAX,Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
54020,L313625,u1595,m105,MAX,I believe I said I'd be tempted.
54021,L313624,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?"
54022,L313623,u1595,m105,MAX,Which one?
54023,L313622,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'm not sure you answered my question.
54024,L313621,u1595,m105,MAX,More or less.
54025,L313620,u1593,m105,JACKIE,And is that it?
54026,L313619,u1595,m105,MAX,"He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, ""What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it."
54027,L313618,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Did you do it that night?
54028,L313617,u1595,m105,MAX,That's my job.
54029,L313616,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You do that?
54030,L313615,u1595,m105,MAX,"Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County."
54031,L313614,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What do you do when he comes home?
54032,L313613,u1595,m105,MAX,"And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him."
54033,L313612,u1595,m105,MAX,Got another gun and a stun gun...
54034,L313609,u1595,m105,MAX,Uh-huh.
54035,L313608,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
54036,L313607,u1595,m105,MAX,"Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home."
54037,L313606,u1593,m105,JACKIE,The day you got me out of jail?
54038,L313605,u1595,m105,MAX,"Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman."
54039,L313604,u1595,m105,MAX,It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
54040,L313603,u1593,m105,JACKIE,When did you decide?
54041,L313602,u1595,m105,MAX,A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
54042,L313601,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Why?
54043,L313600,u1595,m105,MAX,"I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones."
54044,L313599,u1595,m105,MAX,"Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business."
54045,L313598,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You're avoiding the question.
54046,L313597,u1595,m105,MAX,A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
54047,L313596,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
54048,L313595,u1595,m105,MAX,"If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?"
54049,L313594,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else."
54050,L313593,u1595,m105,MAX,What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
54051,L313592,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What about you Max?
54052,L313591,u1595,m105,MAX,"No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence."
54053,L313590,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He tries to act cool.
54054,L313589,u1595,m105,MAX,Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
54055,L313588,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire."
54056,L313587,u1595,m105,MAX,You know some interesting people.
54057,L313586,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words."
54058,L313585,u1595,m105,MAX,Has he hinted around?
54059,L313584,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
54060,L313583,u1595,m105,MAX,I see.
54061,L313582,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He's setting me up to make a proposition.
54062,L313581,u1595,m105,MAX,I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
54063,L313580,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
54064,L313579,u1595,m105,MAX,You think he's got a thing for you?
54065,L313578,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me."
54066,L313577,u1595,m105,MAX,I called you last night.
54067,L313576,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags."
54068,L313575,u1595,m105,MAX,He was here?
54069,L313574,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
54070,L313573,u1595,m105,MAX,Will Ordell go for that?
54071,L313572,u1595,m105,MAX,"Sit down, leave the bag under the table?"
54072,L313571,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Right around here, in the food court."
54073,L313570,u1595,m105,MAX,Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
54074,L313569,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag."
54075,L313568,u1595,m105,MAX,You don't actually do it that way?
54076,L313567,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here."
54077,L313566,u1595,m105,MAX,Bring the money in and they follow it?
54078,L313565,u1593,m105,JACKIE,They seem to like the idea.
54079,L313564,u1595,m105,MAX,You talk them into it?
54080,L313563,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I go back to work tomorrow.
54081,L313562,u1595,m105,MAX,"What're you, a bag lady?"
54082,L313561,u1595,m105,MAX,I don't care.
54083,L313560,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How old's Annette?
54084,L313559,u1595,m105,MAX,I'm old enough to be her father.
54085,L313558,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Why?
54086,L313557,u1595,m105,MAX,She's adorable. But I had to end it.
54087,L313556,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in ""Speed."" She's cute."
54088,L313555,u1595,m105,MAX,Sandra Bullock. You know her?
54089,L313554,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Who was your girl before Annette?
54090,L313552,u1595,m105,MAX,For now. These relationships never last too long.
54091,L313551,u1593,m105,JACKIE,And Annette's it for you?
54092,L313550,u1595,m105,MAX,"Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady."
54093,L313549,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Does it happen to all men?
54094,L313546,u1595,m105,MAX,No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
54095,L313545,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Oh, are you? Does she know that?"
54096,L313544,u1595,m105,MAX,Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
54097,L313543,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How was it?
54098,L313542,u1595,m105,MAX,"""American President"""
54099,L313541,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What'd ya see?
54100,L313540,u1595,m105,MAX,Catching a movie.
54101,L313539,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?"
54102,L313538,u1595,m105,MAX,I walked right past you.
54103,L313537,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Surprise.
54104,L313536,u1595,m105,MAX,"Well, hello."
54105,L313326,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell."
54106,L313325,u1595,m105,MAX,Fifteen thousand.
54107,L313324,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
54108,L313323,u1595,m105,MAX,Does something else worry you?
54109,L313321,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Yeah.
54110,L313320,u1595,m105,MAX,Bigger?
54111,L313319,u1593,m105,JACKIE,My ass ain't the same.
54112,L313317,u1595,m105,MAX,"You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department."
54113,L313316,u1593,m105,JACKIE,It's different with men.
54114,L313315,u1595,m105,MAX,"I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me."
54115,L313314,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How'd you feel about it?
54116,L313313,u1595,m105,MAX,"Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it."
54117,L313312,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Really?
54118,L313311,u1595,m105,MAX,It's not really something I think about.
54119,L313310,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
54120,L313309,u1595,m105,MAX,You're not old. You look great.
54121,L313308,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How do you feel about getting old?
54122,L313307,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again."
54123,L313306,u1595,m105,MAX,It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
54124,L313305,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em."
54125,L313304,u1595,m105,MAX,You're gonna offer to set him up?
54126,L313303,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work."
54127,L313302,u1595,m105,MAX,How do you get it out?
54128,L313300,u1595,m105,MAX,No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
54129,L313299,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
54130,L313298,u1595,m105,MAX,Why?
54131,L313297,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
54132,L313296,u1593,m105,JACKIE,We talked.
54133,L313295,u1595,m105,MAX,What?... What'd you do?
54134,L313294,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He came by.
54135,L313293,u1595,m105,MAX,He called you?
54136,L313292,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He told me last night.
54137,L313291,u1595,m105,MAX,How'd you find that out?
54138,L313290,u1593,m105,JACKIE,It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
54139,L313289,u1595,m105,MAX,"Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point."
54140,L313288,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
54141,L313287,u1595,m105,MAX,What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
54142,L313286,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
54143,L313285,u1595,m105,MAX,Are you?
54144,L313284,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available."
54145,L313283,u1595,m105,MAX,It's nice.
54146,L313282,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"'74, I think."
54147,L313281,u1595,m105,MAX,'76?
54148,L313280,u1593,m105,JACKIE,The Delfonics.
54149,L313279,u1595,m105,MAX,Who is this?
54150,L313278,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
54151,L313277,u1595,m105,MAX,This is pretty.
54152,L313274,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
54153,L313273,u1595,m105,MAX,You never got into the whole CD revolution?
54154,L313272,u1595,m105,MAX,It looks nice.
54155,L313271,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
54156,L313270,u1595,m105,MAX,Sure.
54157,L313269,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Want to hear some music?
54158,L313268,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Yeah.
54159,L313267,u1595,m105,MAX,Somebody loan it to you?
54160,L313265,u1595,m105,MAX,You went out this morning and bought a gun.
54161,L313264,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"What, I couldn't hear you?"
54162,L313263,u1595,m105,MAX,You went out this morning and bought a gun?
54163,L313262,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Thanks, but I have my own now."
54164,L313260,u1595,m105,MAX,Black's fine.
54165,L313259,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
54166,L313258,u1595,m105,MAX,You get a chance to use it?
54167,L313257,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I am. Have a seat.
54168,L313256,u1595,m105,MAX,If you're having some.
54169,L313185,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
54170,L313184,u1595,m105,MAX,What'dya think?
54171,L313183,u1595,m105,MAX,"Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?"
54172,L313182,u1593,m105,JACKIE,But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
54173,L313181,u1595,m105,MAX,"Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something."
54174,L313180,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yeah, if I cooperate."
54175,L313179,u1595,m105,MAX,Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
54176,L313178,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer."
54177,L313177,u1595,m105,MAX,"If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?"
54178,L313176,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope."
54179,L313175,u1595,m105,MAX,Cash poor?
54180,L313174,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?"
54181,L313173,u1595,m105,MAX,He's got that kinda money?
54182,L313172,u1593,m105,JACKIE,With ten thousand? Nine.
54183,L313171,u1595,m105,MAX,How many trips did you make?
54184,L313170,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that."
54185,L313169,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
54186,L313168,u1595,m105,MAX,"'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?"
54187,L313167,u1593,m105,JACKIE,It was the other guy who busted me.
54188,L313166,u1595,m105,MAX,He's the one who wants you.
54189,L313165,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms."
54190,L313164,u1595,m105,MAX,"No, you didn't. What branch?"
54191,L313163,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I didn't?
54192,L313162,u1595,m105,MAX,"You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal."
54193,L313161,u1593,m105,JACKIE,The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
54194,L313160,u1595,m105,MAX,Same as you. Ten thousand.
54195,L313159,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Ordell pick up his bond?
54196,L313158,u1595,m105,MAX,I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
54197,L313157,u1593,m105,JACKIE,That's him. How do you know 'em?
54198,L313156,u1595,m105,MAX,That would be Beaumont Livingston.
54199,L313153,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
54200,L313152,u1595,m105,MAX,What did they want to know?
54201,L313151,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
54202,L313150,u1595,m105,MAX,They wanted you to tell them what you know.
54203,L313149,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. ""Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?"" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that."
54204,L313148,u1595,m105,MAX,You know who put the dope in your bag?
54205,L313147,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Sure.
54206,L313146,u1595,m105,MAX,"But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?"
54207,L313145,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Shit.
54208,L313144,u1595,m105,MAX,I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
54209,L313143,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?"
54210,L313142,u1595,m105,MAX,What have they told you?
54211,L313141,u1595,m105,MAX,"I am, as a matter of fact."
54212,L313140,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You're not tired of it?
54213,L313139,u1595,m105,MAX,"You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options."
54214,L313138,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are."
54215,L313137,u1595,m105,MAX,Was she helpful?
54216,L313136,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
54217,L313135,u1595,m105,MAX,What's your brand?
54218,L313134,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand."
54219,L313133,u1595,m105,MAX,Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
54220,L313132,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You gain weight?
54221,L313130,u1595,m105,MAX,Great.
54222,L313129,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me."
54223,L313128,u1595,m105,MAX,Why does it need to be dark?
54224,L313127,u1593,m105,JACKIE,That doesn't sound dark.
54225,L313126,u1595,m105,MAX,It's kind of a sports bar
54226,L313125,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Is it dark?
54227,L313124,u1595,m105,MAX,We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
54228,L313123,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I'd love one, but not there."
54229,L313122,u1595,m105,MAX,I thought you might want a drink?
54230,L313121,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
54231,L313120,u1595,m105,MAX,It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
54232,L313119,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I don't think so.
54233,L313118,u1595,m105,MAX,"Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?"
54234,L313117,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Can we stop for cigarettes?
54235,L313116,u1595,m105,MAX,In cash.
54236,L313115,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Who put up my bond? Ordell?
54237,L313114,u1595,m105,MAX,You're serious?
54238,L313113,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Can I see your I.D.?
54239,L313112,u1595,m105,MAX,I gave you my card there.
54240,L313111,u1595,m105,MAX,Who do you think I am?
54241,L313110,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Are you really a bail bondsman?
54242,L313109,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Okay.
54243,L313108,u1595,m105,MAX,I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
54244,L313032,u1599,m105,PUBLIC DEFENDER,With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
54245,L313031,u1593,m105,JACKIE,If I don't cooperate?
54246,L313030,u1599,m105,PUBLIC DEFENDER,And cooperate? You might get probation.
54247,L313029,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What if I plead guilty?
54248,L313028,u1599,m105,PUBLIC DEFENDER,I beg your pardon?
54249,L313027,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Who's side are you on?
54250,L313026,u1599,m105,PUBLIC DEFENDER,"Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up."
54251,L313025,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
54252,L313674,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you."
54253,L313673,u1600,m105,SHERONDA,He say is a surprise.
54254,L313672,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You know what's in the bag you're taking?
54255,L313671,u1600,m105,SHERONDA,Yes'm.
54256,L313670,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Then you don't see him for a few days?
54257,L313669,u1600,m105,SHERONDA,"Sometimes every day, for a while."
54258,L313668,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Not every day?
54259,L313667,u1600,m105,SHERONDA,Most of the times.
54260,L313666,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Do you live together?
54261,L313665,u1600,m105,SHERONDA,He say we like the same thing as married.
54262,L314084,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story."
54263,L314083,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Do you think I took some of that money?
54264,L314082,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What about you?
54265,L314081,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What about me?
54266,L314080,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you."
54267,L314079,u1593,m105,JACKIE,So what happens now?
54268,L314078,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range."
54269,L314077,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I thought you were watching him.
54270,L314076,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
54271,L314073,u1597,m105,NICOLET,I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
54272,L314072,u1593,m105,JACKIE,If it'll make you happy.
54273,L314071,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You'd take a polygraph on it?
54274,L314070,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I have no idea.
54275,L314069,u1597,m105,NICOLET,It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
54276,L314068,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?"
54277,L314067,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?"
54278,L314066,u1597,m105,NICOLET,We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
54279,L314065,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Not in the fitting room.
54280,L314064,u1597,m105,NICOLET,There was a guy with Melanie?
54281,L314063,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling."
54282,L314062,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What did you do after that?
54283,L314061,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
54284,L314060,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
54285,L314059,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform."
54286,L314058,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Where's the bag she gave you?
54287,L314057,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it."
54288,L314056,u1597,m105,NICOLET,But you didn't do that.
54289,L314055,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home."
54290,L314054,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after."
54291,L314053,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I thought I did.
54292,L313883,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Si.
54293,L313882,u1597,m105,NICOLET,I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
54294,L313881,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
54295,L313880,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now."
54296,L313879,u1593,m105,JACKIE,That would be one point of view.
54297,L313878,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?"
54298,L313877,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Yes. All those things are true.
54299,L313876,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?"
54300,L313875,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
54301,L313874,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What? To put one of these in my pocket?
54302,L313873,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Ever been tempted?
54303,L313870,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I never have. It's not my money.
54304,L313869,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You didn't count it?
54305,L313868,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I was told ten thousand in each pack.
54306,L313867,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much."
54307,L313863,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court."
54308,L313862,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"We could, if I'm not in jail."
54309,L313861,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?"
54310,L313860,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You said that the last time.
54311,L313829,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Right. Everything's the same, except one change..."
54312,L313828,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?"
54313,L313827,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
54314,L313826,u1597,m105,NICOLET,But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
54315,L313825,u1593,m105,JACKIE,She didn't say.
54316,L313824,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Was she there?
54317,L313823,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
54318,L313822,u1597,m105,NICOLET,She told you that?
54319,L313821,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
54320,L313820,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What did you say?
54321,L313819,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'm sure that was the idea.
54322,L313818,u1597,m105,NICOLET,And splittin' with her?
54323,L313817,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell."
54324,L313816,u1597,m105,NICOLET,What's her story?
54325,L313815,u1593,m105,JACKIE,White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
54326,L313814,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Who's the other one?
54327,L313813,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Not yet.
54328,L313812,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Ever meet her, or they talk about her?"
54329,L313811,u1597,m105,NICOLET,...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
54330,L313809,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell."
54331,L313808,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I imagine shit needs to be done.
54332,L313807,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
54333,L313806,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What for?
54334,L313805,u1597,m105,NICOLET,His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
54335,L313804,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Not really.
54336,L313803,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You talk to him?
54337,L313802,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out."
54338,L313801,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You two meet?
54339,L313800,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
54340,L313647,u1593,m105,JACKIE,A Broadway shopping bag.
54341,L313646,u1597,m105,NICOLET,The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
54342,L313636,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I thought you were going to let this one through.
54343,L313635,u1597,m105,NICOLET,I'm recording this.
54344,L313634,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What are you doing?
54345,L313633,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX."
54346,L313365,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity."
54347,L313364,u1597,m105,NICOLET,How can you help us?
54348,L313363,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?"
54349,L313362,u1597,m105,NICOLET,Then how do you know he sells guns?
54350,L313361,u1593,m105,JACKIE,No.
54351,L313360,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You ever see him sell guns?
54352,L313359,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He sells guns.
54353,L313358,u1597,m105,NICOLET,No shit. You know how he makes his money?
54354,L313355,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You never asked me if I did or not.
54355,L313354,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Oh, so now you know him?"
54356,L313351,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"If I'm working, I can help you."
54357,L313350,u1597,m105,NICOLET,You know what we want.
54358,L313349,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired."
54359,L313348,u1597,m105,NICOLET,We can look into that.
54360,L313347,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
54361,L313346,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?"
54362,L313334,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Can I smoke?
54363,L313333,u1597,m105,NICOLET,We'll just be a minute.
54364,L313020,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?"
54365,L313019,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Look, that shit ain't mine."
54366,L313018,u1593,m105,JACKIE,You planted that shit on me.
54367,L313017,u1597,m105,NICOLET,I know what it looks like.
54368,L313016,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What the fuck is that shit?
54369,L313015,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"And what would this be, Sweet and Low?"
54370,L313014,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Yeah?
54371,L313013,u1597,m105,NICOLET,"Oh, Miss Brown?"
54372,L313915,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
54373,L313914,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Thanks.
54374,L313913,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
54375,L313911,u1596,m105,MELANIE,You betcha.
54376,L313910,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Do you got something for me?
54377,L313909,u1596,m105,MELANIE,It looks good on you.
54378,L313908,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Yeah, do you like it?"
54379,L313907,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Are you getting that black suit?
54380,L313906,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Hi, Melanie."
54381,L313905,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Jackie?
54382,L313798,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I don't think so, but thanks for the beer."
54383,L313797,u1596,m105,MELANIE,What's that fucker ever done for us?
54384,L313796,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Keep it between us girls?
54385,L313795,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?"
54386,L313794,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Dreaming.
54387,L313793,u1596,m105,MELANIE,You think I'm kidding?
54388,L313791,u1596,m105,MELANIE,So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
54389,L313790,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Kinda.
54390,L313789,u1596,m105,MELANIE,You already knew that?
54391,L313788,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Beaumont Livingston?
54392,L313787,u1596,m105,MELANIE,He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
54393,L313786,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em."
54394,L313785,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He said he didn't know about it.
54395,L313782,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"That coke was yours, wasn't it?"
54396,L313781,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
54397,L313780,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"He told me to go outside.  ""You may leave us now."" It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be ""the man."" You know Mr. Walker don't you?"
54398,L313779,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What were you two fighting about?
54399,L313778,u1596,m105,MELANIE,This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
54400,L313777,u1593,m105,JACKIE,How long you been with Ordell?
54401,L313775,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Gimme one anyway.
54402,L313774,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Uh-uh.
54403,L313773,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
54404,L313772,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Killian's.
54405,L313766,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Great...  ...Wanda!
54406,L313765,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Sure.
54407,L313763,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway."
54408,L313762,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
54409,L313761,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'm waiting for the phone.
54410,L313760,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Buy ya a beer?
54411,L313759,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Oh, hi."
54412,L313753,u1593,m105,JACKIE,He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
54413,L313752,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
54414,L313751,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it."
54415,L313750,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you."
54416,L313749,u1593,m105,JACKIE,And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
54417,L313748,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get."
54418,L313747,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you."
54419,L313746,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him."
54420,L313745,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Ray, the A.T.F. guy."
54421,L313744,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Who's paging you?
54422,L313742,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
54423,L313741,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Where you gonna be during all this?
54424,L313740,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished."
54425,L313737,u1593,m105,JACKIE,The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
54426,L313736,u1598,m105,ORDELL,She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
54427,L313735,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Designer clothes.
54428,L313734,u1598,m105,ORDELL,She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
54429,L313733,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?"
54430,L313732,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?"
54431,L313729,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?"
54432,L313728,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What does she think she's gettin?
54433,L313727,u1598,m105,ORDELL,She don't know shit about the money.
54434,L313726,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Are you sure she don't know about the money?
54435,L313725,u1598,m105,ORDELL,She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
54436,L313724,u1593,m105,JACKIE,It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
54437,L313723,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Man, I don't like that part."
54438,L313722,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
54439,L313718,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
54440,L313717,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it."
54441,L313716,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this."
54442,L313715,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, you weren't supposed to be there."
54443,L313714,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I was there, I saw her do it."
54444,L313713,u1598,m105,ORDELL,How do you know she did that?
54445,L313712,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout."
54446,L313711,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What the hell you talkin' bout?
54447,L313710,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all."
54448,L313709,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I need to talk to you alone.
54449,L313708,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Drink?
54450,L313533,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise."
54451,L313532,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up."
54452,L313531,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What'd you care?
54453,L313530,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Who?
54454,L313529,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Uh-huh.
54455,L313528,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?"
54456,L313523,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I can do that.
54457,L313522,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Plus the same deal as before.
54458,L313521,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I'll give ya ten.
54459,L313520,u1593,m105,JACKIE,That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
54460,L313519,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Managers get ten percent.
54461,L313518,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent."
54462,L313517,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner."
54463,L313516,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, it's my plan. We're in this together."
54464,L313515,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
54465,L313514,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
54466,L313513,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
54467,L313512,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Can you cover that?
54468,L313511,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"So we need two people, two women."
54469,L313510,u1593,m105,JACKIE,That's the idea.
54470,L313509,u1598,m105,ORDELL,And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
54471,L313508,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"No, I give it to someone else first."
54472,L313507,u1598,m105,ORDELL,But you don't?
54473,L313506,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before..."
54474,L313505,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Yeah, I think a woman."
54475,L313504,u1593,m105,JACKIE,If you want.
54476,L313503,u1598,m105,ORDELL,A woman.
54477,L313502,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I don't know. One of your friends.
54478,L313501,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Who?
54479,L313500,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone."
54480,L313499,u1598,m105,ORDELL,That's a good idea.
54481,L313498,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is."
54482,L313497,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money."
54483,L313496,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill."
54484,L313472,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What did they say?
54485,L313471,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in."
54486,L313470,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What the fuck's that got to do with it?
54487,L313469,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"It's true, isn't it?"
54488,L313468,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You told them that?
54489,L313467,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here."
54490,L313466,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Didja tell 'em anything else?
54491,L313465,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You."
54492,L313464,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!"
54493,L313463,u1593,m105,JACKIE,They already know it's you.
54494,L313462,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You told em? You told em it's me?
54495,L313458,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I told them.
54496,L313457,u1598,m105,ORDELL,How the fuck they know that?
54497,L313456,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you."
54498,L313455,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?"
54499,L313454,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I do okay.
54500,L313453,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass."
54501,L313390,u1593,m105,JACKIE,It's a cockatoo.
54502,L313389,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?"
54503,L313388,u1593,m105,JACKIE,It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
54504,L313387,u1598,m105,ORDELL,The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
54505,L313386,u1593,m105,JACKIE,The Cockatoo Inn.
54506,L313253,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Talk to you tomorrow.
54507,L313252,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
54508,L313251,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea."
54509,L313250,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Yeah.
54510,L313249,u1593,m105,JACKIE,All your money's in Mexico.
54511,L313248,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I got a problem...
54512,L313247,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand."
54513,L313246,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Yeah?
54514,L313245,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail."
54515,L313244,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Baby, I didn't --"
54516,L313243,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me."
54517,L313241,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?"
54518,L313240,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I just came here to talk.
54519,L313236,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
54520,L313235,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do."
54521,L313234,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Go sit over in that chair.
54522,L313233,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I understand woman, damn!"
54523,L313232,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"I said, you understand what I'm saying"
54524,L313231,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back."
54525,L313230,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?"
54526,L313229,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you."
54527,L313228,u1593,m105,JACKIE,The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
54528,L313227,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much."
54529,L313226,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
54530,L313225,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What the hell you doin'?
54531,L313224,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga."
54532,L313223,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
54533,L313222,u1593,m105,JACKIE,What do you think it is?
54534,L313216,u1593,m105,JACKIE,They told me.
54535,L313215,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?"
54536,L313211,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I didn't tell 'em anything.
54537,L313210,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Yeah?
54538,L313209,u1593,m105,JACKIE,And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
54539,L313208,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I knew it.
54540,L313207,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Beaumont Livingston.
54541,L313205,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know."
54542,L313204,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
54543,L313203,u1598,m105,ORDELL,And what was your answer?
54544,L313202,u1593,m105,JACKIE,They asked.
54545,L313201,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too."
54546,L313198,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business."
54547,L313197,u1593,m105,JACKIE,"The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot."
54548,L313196,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Who you think got your ass outta jail?
54549,L313195,u1593,m105,JACKIE,For what?
54550,L313193,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Sure.
54551,L313192,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?"
54552,L313191,u1593,m105,JACKIE,Yeah.
54553,L313190,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Got some o.j.?
54554,L313189,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I got some vodka in the freezer.
54555,L313187,u1593,m105,JACKIE,I was expecting you. Come in.
54556,L313186,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"How you doing, Ms. Jackie?"
54557,L313955,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Okay, Lou-is."
54558,L313954,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
54559,L313952,u1596,m105,MELANIE,You sure?
54560,L313951,u1594,m105,LOUIS,This one.
54561,L313950,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Is it this aisle or the next one over?
54562,L313949,u1596,m105,MELANIE,You sure?
54563,L313948,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Yeah, down the end."
54564,L313947,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Is it this aisle, Lou-is?"
54565,L313941,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake."
54566,L313940,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I'm carrying it.
54567,L313938,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
54568,L313937,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?"
54569,L313936,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Goddam you. Gimme that bag,"
54570,L313935,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Fuck you. I can carry it.
54571,L313934,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Lemme have the bag.
54572,L313933,u1596,m105,MELANIE,I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
54573,L313932,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What are you doin'?
54574,L313927,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Are you sweating?
54575,L313926,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?"
54576,L313925,u1596,m105,MELANIE,That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
54577,L313923,u1594,m105,LOUIS,We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
54578,L313922,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis."
54579,L313896,u1596,m105,MELANIE,All right already.
54580,L313895,u1594,m105,LOUIS,We're leaving now!
54581,L313495,u1596,m105,MELANIE,...and just take it from him.
54582,L313494,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Uh-huh?
54583,L313493,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
54584,L313492,u1594,m105,LOUIS,And your point is?
54585,L313491,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here."
54586,L313490,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Uh-huh?
54587,L313489,u1596,m105,MELANIE,I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
54588,L313488,u1594,m105,LOUIS,You live with him.
54589,L313487,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Please.
54590,L313486,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Does that bother you?
54591,L313485,u1596,m105,MELANIE,He went to meet that stewardess.
54592,L313484,u1594,m105,LOUIS,No.
54593,L313483,u1596,m105,MELANIE,That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
54594,L313482,u1594,m105,LOUIS,So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
54595,L313481,u1596,m105,MELANIE,He killed a man worked for him the other night.
54596,L313479,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
54597,L313478,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright."
54598,L313477,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Yeah.
54599,L313476,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Is it dead?
54600,L313446,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Now that's over, let's get to know each other."
54601,L313445,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Yeah, that really hit the spot."
54602,L313443,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Sure.
54603,L313442,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Wanna fuck?
54604,L313441,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan."
54605,L313440,u1594,m105,LOUIS,That sounds like a problem.
54606,L313439,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese."
54607,L313438,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Must of made quite an impression.
54608,L313437,u1596,m105,MELANIE,That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
54609,L313436,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Who's arm is that?
54610,L313435,u1596,m105,MELANIE,About five years ago.
54611,L313434,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"You lived in Japan, when?"
54612,L313433,u1596,m105,MELANIE,I lived there for about nine months.
54613,L313432,u1594,m105,LOUIS,You been to Japan?
54614,L313431,u1596,m105,MELANIE,That's a picture of me in Japan.
54615,L313430,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?"
54616,L313429,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Did you ever go I one?
54617,L313428,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I don't like dancing.
54618,L313427,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"C'mon, don't lie."
54619,L313426,u1594,m105,LOUIS,No.
54620,L313425,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Were you a disco guy?
54621,L313424,u1594,m105,LOUIS,We had done time together already.
54622,L313423,u1596,m105,MELANIE,With Ordell?
54623,L313422,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Detroit.
54624,L313421,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Where were you?
54625,L313420,u1594,m105,LOUIS,No.
54626,L313419,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"That was taken at a place called ""Flippers."" It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?"
54627,L313418,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco."
54628,L313417,u1594,m105,LOUIS,So where did you go?
54629,L313416,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos."
54630,L313415,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Were you a disco girl?
54631,L313414,u1596,m105,MELANIE,I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
54632,L313413,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I thought you were sixteen.
54633,L313412,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Yeah.
54634,L313411,u1594,m105,LOUIS,You're fourteen years old here?
54635,L313410,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Fourteen.
54636,L313409,u1594,m105,LOUIS,The roller disco one.
54637,L313408,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Which one?
54638,L313406,u1594,m105,LOUIS,No thanks.
54639,L313405,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"No, it's what body builders drink to beef up."
54640,L313404,u1594,m105,LOUIS,It's a diet thing?
54641,L313403,u1596,m105,MELANIE,It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
54642,L313402,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What's a Metrix?
54643,L313401,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Want a Metrix?
54644,L313393,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time."
54645,L313392,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing."
54646,L313391,u1596,m105,MELANIE,You okay?
54647,L313385,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Yeah, there's another hit left."
54648,L313384,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Is it ready to go?
54649,L312804,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"Really, I'm impressed."
54650,L312803,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Bank robbery.
54651,L312802,u1596,m105,MELANIE,What for?
54652,L312801,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Uh-huh.
54653,L312800,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Four years?
54654,L312799,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Two months shy of four years.
54655,L312798,u1596,m105,MELANIE,How long?
54656,L312797,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Susanville.
54657,L312796,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Where at?
54658,L312795,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Four days ago.
54659,L312794,u1596,m105,MELANIE,When did you get out of jail?
54660,L312793,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Sure.
54661,L312792,u1596,m105,MELANIE,Want a hit?
54662,L312791,u1596,m105,MELANIE,He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
54663,L312790,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
54664,L312789,u1596,m105,MELANIE,He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
54665,L312788,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I can sit through it once.
54666,L312787,u1596,m105,MELANIE,"It's boring, isn't it?"
54667,L314049,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!"
54668,L314048,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons."
54669,L314047,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!"
54670,L314046,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?"
54671,L314045,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?"
54672,L314044,u1594,m105,LOUIS,How am I supposed to know that?
54673,L314043,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county."
54674,L314042,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
54675,L314041,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!"
54676,L314040,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Max Cherry.
54677,L314039,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You gonna tell me who it was?
54678,L314038,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend."
54679,L314037,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Tell me.
54680,L314036,u1594,m105,LOUIS,You know who I saw in the dress department?
54681,L314035,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What?
54682,L314034,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Jesus Christ.
54683,L314033,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room."
54684,L314032,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
54685,L314031,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off."
54686,L314030,u1594,m105,LOUIS,That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
54687,L314029,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass."
54688,L314028,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Maybe the Feds got it.
54689,L314027,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her."
54690,L314026,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?"
54691,L314025,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Okay, so it was Jackie Brown."
54692,L314022,u1594,m105,LOUIS,It's in there.
54693,L314021,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What'd you shoot her with?
54694,L314020,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Pull the car over.
54695,L314019,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Fuck you for asking me that.
54696,L314018,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
54697,L314017,u1594,m105,LOUIS,That's right.
54698,L314016,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Where you shot her.
54699,L314015,u1594,m105,LOUIS,We went to the parking lot.
54700,L314014,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Then what?
54701,L314013,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her."
54702,L314012,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Louis, You tellin' me the truth?"
54703,L314011,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Maybe a minute. She came right out.
54704,L314010,u1598,m105,ORDELL,How long was she in there?
54705,L314009,u1594,m105,LOUIS,The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
54706,L314008,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Came outta where?
54707,L314007,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I."
54708,L314006,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million."
54709,L314005,u1594,m105,LOUIS,You said five hundred and fifty!
54710,L314004,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Maybe forty, maybe not that much."
54711,L314003,u1594,m105,LOUIS,How much it there?
54712,L314002,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Where's the rest of it?
54713,L314001,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What?
54714,L314000,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Louis?
54715,L313999,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman."
54716,L313998,u1594,m105,LOUIS,In the chest and stomach.
54717,L313997,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Where did you shoot her?
54718,L313996,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Pretty sure.
54719,L313995,u1598,m105,ORDELL,So you're sure she's dead.
54720,L313994,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Uh-huh.
54721,L313993,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You shot her twice?
54722,L313992,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
54723,L313991,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You couldn't just hit her?
54724,L313990,u1594,m105,LOUIS,You know how she is.
54725,L313989,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Couldn't talk to her?
54726,L313988,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Twice. In the parking lot.
54727,L313987,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You shot Melanie?
54728,L313985,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I shot her.
54729,L313984,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"So what, you left her there."
54730,L313983,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. ""Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?"" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves."
54731,L313982,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?"
54732,L313981,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Not now, pick me up."
54733,L313980,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --"
54734,L313979,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
54735,L313978,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag."
54736,L313977,u1598,m105,ORDELL,When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
54737,L313976,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you."
54738,L313975,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Did you get it?
54739,L313974,u1594,m105,LOUIS,It's Louis.
54740,L313894,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door."
54741,L313893,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'"
54742,L313892,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge."
54743,L313731,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you."
54744,L313730,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Uh-huh.
54745,L313701,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal."
54746,L313700,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I still don't understand why you keep her around.
54747,L313699,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
54748,L313698,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What does that mean?
54749,L313697,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I don't hafta trust her, I know her."
54750,L313696,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
54751,L313695,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word."
54752,L313694,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Well, why the fuck keep her around?"
54753,L313693,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
54754,L313692,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Yep.
54755,L313691,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?"
54756,L313690,u1594,m105,LOUIS,That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
54757,L313689,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say ""thank you"" and I'll tell you, ""you're welcome."""
54758,L313687,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway."
54759,L313686,u1594,m105,LOUIS,She believed you?
54760,L313685,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood."
54761,L313684,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What's your relationship?
54762,L313683,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Sure.
54763,L313682,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Can I ask you about Melanie?
54764,L313681,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
54765,L313680,u1594,m105,LOUIS,How much is there?
54766,L313375,u1598,m105,ORDELL,But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
54767,L313374,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I didn't look like a bum.
54768,L312970,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I follow.
54769,L312969,u1598,m105,ORDELL,So we on the same page then?
54770,L312968,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Yeah.
54771,L312967,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?"
54772,L312966,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What did he do?
54773,L312965,u1598,m105,ORDELL,An employee I had to let go.
54774,L312964,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Who was Beaumont?
54775,L312963,u1598,m105,ORDELL,That was Beaumont.
54776,L312962,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Who was that?
54777,L312959,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you."
54778,L312958,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I'm in my underwear.
54779,L312957,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here."
54780,L312956,u1594,m105,LOUIS,C'mon in.
54781,L312955,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Uh-huh.
54782,L312954,u1594,m105,LOUIS,You're outside?
54783,L312953,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
54784,L312952,u1594,m105,LOUIS,The moon -- I dunno
54785,L312951,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I know you don't know. I said guess.
54786,L312950,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I dunno.
54787,L312949,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Guess where I am?
54788,L312948,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was."
54789,L312947,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Whatcha watchin'?
54790,L312946,u1594,m105,LOUIS,"Oh, I dunno. Watching TV."
54791,L312945,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?"
54792,L312863,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
54793,L312862,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Okay.
54794,L312861,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go ""bleep."" That means the alarm's off and the doors are open."
54795,L312860,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What do I do?
54796,L312859,u1598,m105,ORDELL,This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
54797,L312858,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Which one is for the car?
54798,L312857,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Take the keys, man. Listen to music."
54799,L312854,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?"
54800,L312853,u1594,m105,LOUIS,I'm going to wait in the car.
54801,L312815,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
54802,L312814,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Then what?
54803,L312813,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million."
54804,L312812,u1594,m105,LOUIS,That's good money.
54805,L312811,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece."
54806,L312810,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in."
54807,L312809,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Are you serious?
54808,L312808,u1598,m105,ORDELL,As low as two.
54809,L312807,u1594,m105,LOUIS,What's your cost?
54810,L312806,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on ""New York Undercover"" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty."
54811,L312778,u1594,m105,LOUIS,Who's your partner?
54812,L312777,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Thanks, Baby."
54813,L314110,u1595,m105,MAX,I think I do. Is that good enough?
54814,L314109,u1601,m105,WINSTON,"Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know."
54815,L314108,u1595,m105,MAX,They don't have your winning personality.
54816,L314107,u1601,m105,WINSTON,"Cops can't locate him, huh?"
54817,L314106,u1595,m105,MAX,"You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?"
54818,L313889,u1601,m105,WINSTON,Have fun.
54819,L313888,u1595,m105,MAX,Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
54820,L313887,u1601,m105,WINSTON,Watcha gonna see?
54821,L313886,u1595,m105,MAX,"I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat."
54822,L313885,u1601,m105,WINSTON,Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
54823,L313884,u1595,m105,MAX,I'm going out for a few hours.
54824,L314199,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You better be, motherfucker."
54825,L314198,u1595,m105,MAX,Yes.
54826,L314197,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You sure?
54827,L314196,u1595,m105,MAX,No.
54828,L314195,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?"
54829,L314194,u1595,m105,MAX,Yeah.
54830,L314193,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?"
54831,L314192,u1595,m105,MAX,Uh-huh.
54832,L314191,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"My money's in that office, right?"
54833,L314190,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I know where to turn.
54834,L314189,u1595,m105,MAX,Turn left.
54835,L314188,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I know where it is.
54836,L314187,u1595,m105,MAX,It's the next street.
54837,L314184,u1595,m105,MAX,She will.
54838,L314183,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I call your office, she better answer the phone."
54839,L314182,u1595,m105,MAX,She's all alone.
54840,L314181,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?"
54841,L314180,u1595,m105,MAX,Uh-huh.
54842,L314179,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office."
54843,L314178,u1595,m105,MAX,"If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything."
54844,L314177,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You expect me to just walk in there?
54845,L314176,u1595,m105,MAX,"I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone."
54846,L314175,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Call her, tell her the combination."
54847,L314174,u1595,m105,MAX,It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
54848,L314173,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Have her bring the money here.
54849,L314172,u1595,m105,MAX,She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
54850,L314171,u1598,m105,ORDELL,That I gotta see.
54851,L314170,u1595,m105,MAX,She was afraid.
54852,L314169,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?"
54853,L314168,u1595,m105,MAX,She's been there since Thursday night.
54854,L314167,u1598,m105,ORDELL,And where's Jackie?
54855,L314166,u1595,m105,MAX,My office.
54856,L314165,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
54857,L314164,u1595,m105,MAX,This place stinks.
54858,L314163,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch."
54859,L314162,u1595,m105,MAX,"In a way, yes."
54860,L314161,u1598,m105,ORDELL,And you did that to protect my interest?
54861,L314160,u1595,m105,MAX,All I did was walk out with it.
54862,L314159,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
54863,L314158,u1595,m105,MAX,"Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money."
54864,L314157,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
54865,L314156,u1595,m105,MAX,She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
54866,L314155,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, give it to me then."
54867,L314154,u1595,m105,MAX,Uh-huh.
54868,L314153,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?"
54869,L314152,u1595,m105,MAX,That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
54870,L314151,u1598,m105,ORDELL,How the fuck did he find me?
54871,L314150,u1595,m105,MAX,Winston found you.
54872,L314149,u1598,m105,ORDELL,How'd you find me?
54873,L314148,u1595,m105,MAX,"She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now."
54874,L314147,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
54875,L314146,u1595,m105,MAX,I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
54876,L314145,u1598,m105,ORDELL,That's all?
54877,L314142,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Git your ass in here.
54878,L314141,u1595,m105,MAX,I'm alone.
54879,L314140,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever."
54880,L314139,u1595,m105,MAX,I thought you might be asleep.
54881,L314138,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
54882,L314105,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back."
54883,L314104,u1595,m105,MAX,You still there?
54884,L314103,u1595,m105,MAX,They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
54885,L314102,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"She got off, huh?"
54886,L314101,u1595,m105,MAX,"The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?"
54887,L314100,u1595,m105,MAX,"Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called."
54888,L314099,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You know who this is?
54889,L313548,u1595,m105,MAX,I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
54890,L313547,u1598,m105,ORDELL,What's up with this shit.
54891,L313221,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Is that what I think it is?
54892,L313220,u1595,m105,MAX,Where is it?
54893,L313086,u1595,m105,MAX,Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
54894,L313085,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said ""if"" -- it was just her shit to get high with."
54895,L313084,u1595,m105,MAX,Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
54896,L313083,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --"
54897,L313082,u1595,m105,MAX,"Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab."
54898,L313081,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind."
54899,L313080,u1595,m105,MAX,"If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit."
54900,L313079,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit."
54901,L313078,u1595,m105,MAX,"Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess."
54902,L313077,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I got it. I just don't got it on me.
54903,L313076,u1595,m105,MAX,"I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks."
54904,L313075,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
54905,L313074,u1595,m105,MAX,"You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --"
54906,L313073,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
54907,L313072,u1595,m105,MAX,Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
54908,L313071,u1598,m105,ORDELL,If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
54909,L313070,u1595,m105,MAX,You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
54910,L313069,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?"
54911,L313068,u1595,m105,MAX,Was she?
54912,L313067,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!"
54913,L313066,u1595,m105,MAX,Beaumont worked for you.
54914,L313065,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out."
54915,L313064,u1595,m105,MAX,What does she do for you?
54916,L313063,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Brown, Jackie Brown."
54917,L313062,u1595,m105,MAX,The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
54918,L313061,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure."
54919,L313060,u1595,m105,MAX,Did the police contact you?
54920,L313059,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out."
54921,L313058,u1595,m105,MAX,Hear what?
54922,L313057,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You didn't hear?
54923,L313056,u1595,m105,MAX,What?
54924,L313055,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Somebody already did.
54925,L313054,u1595,m105,MAX,"Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first."
54926,L313053,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all."
54927,L313052,u1595,m105,MAX,It still sounds high.
54928,L313051,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession."
54929,L313050,u1595,m105,MAX,The bond for possession is only a thousand.
54930,L313049,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess."
54931,L313048,u1595,m105,MAX,"Oh, yeah? What did he do?"
54932,L313047,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I got some more business for ya.
54933,L313046,u1595,m105,MAX,I can see that. Why?
54934,L313045,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"The door was opened, so I just came right in."
54935,L313044,u1595,m105,MAX,Comfortable?
54936,L312884,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?"
54937,L312883,u1595,m105,MAX,Yes.
54938,L312882,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Hey, Max."
54939,L312881,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
54940,L312880,u1595,m105,MAX,"Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses."
54941,L312878,u1595,m105,MAX,Now I need you to count your money.
54942,L312877,u1598,m105,ORDELL,House.

54946,L312873,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition."
54947,L312872,u1595,m105,MAX,"They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon."
54948,L312871,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
54949,L312870,u1595,m105,MAX,Possession of unregistered machine guns.
54950,L312869,u1598,m105,ORDELL,Haven't a clue.

54952,L312867,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You don't say.
54953,L312866,u1595,m105,MAX,"On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation."

54960,L312847,u1598,m105,ORDELL,You think you could do that?
54961,L312846,u1595,m105,MAX,"He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses."
54962,L312845,u1598,m105,ORDELL,They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
54963,L312844,u1595,m105,MAX,Ten thousand sounds high.
54964,L312843,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up ""possession of a concealed weapon."" Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him."

54966,L312841,u1598,m105,ORDELL,I know that.
54967,L312840,u1595,m105,MAX,Cost you a thousand for the bond.

54973,L312834,u1595,m105,MAX,"So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?"
54974,L312833,u1598,m105,ORDELL,"It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?"
54975,L312832,u1595,m105,MAX,Yeah.

55070,L315853,u1608,m106,FRANK,Maybe there's a larger truth.

55072,L315851,u1608,m106,FRANK,"Maybe it's not the army, Jake."
55073,L315850,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?"
55074,L315849,u1608,m106,FRANK,"They're not interested, Jake."
55075,L315848,u1612,m106,JACOB,Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
55076,L315847,u1608,m106,FRANK,There's nothing to expose.
55077,L315846,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this."
55078,L315845,u1608,m106,FRANK,I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
55079,L315844,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Well, try, huh."
55080,L315843,u1608,m106,FRANK,It's hard to explain.
55081,L315842,u1612,m106,JACOB,"What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?"
55082,L315841,u1608,m106,FRANK,That's right. We did.

55086,L315752,u1612,m106,JACOB,He was upset. He thought people were following him.
55087,L315751,u1608,m106,FRANK,What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
55088,L315644,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours."

55095,L315627,u1612,m106,JACOB,It was the window.
55096,L315626,u1609,m106,GABE,There was a bang.
55097,L315625,u1612,m106,JACOB,Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
55098,L315624,u1609,m106,GABE,"Daddy, what was that noise?"
55099,L315880,u1610,m106,GEARY,"I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?"
55100,L315879,u1612,m106,JACOB,"War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me."
55101,L315878,u1610,m106,GEARY,"It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand."
55102,L315877,u1612,m106,JACOB,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
55103,L315876,u1610,m106,GEARY,I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
55104,L315875,u1612,m106,JACOB,Used you?
55105,L315874,u1610,m106,GEARY,"I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it."
55106,L315873,u1612,m106,JACOB,Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
55107,L315872,u1610,m106,GEARY,"You mind? I'm eating, huh?"
55108,L315870,u1612,m106,JACOB,"A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something."
55109,L315869,u1610,m106,GEARY,You need ... a doctor.
55110,L315868,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you."
55111,L315866,u1610,m106,GEARY,"Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?"
55112,L315865,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?"
55113,L315816,u1610,m106,GEARY,"Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?"
55114,L315815,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm too messed up to teach.
55115,L315814,u1610,m106,GEARY,Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
55116,L315813,u1612,m106,JACOB,I am.
55117,L315812,u1610,m106,GEARY,Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
55118,L315811,u1612,m106,JACOB,Doctor.  Ph.D.
55119,L315805,u1610,m106,GEARY,Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
55120,L315804,u1612,m106,JACOB,Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
55121,L315803,u1610,m106,GEARY,The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
55122,L315802,u1612,m106,JACOB,"This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what."
55123,L315801,u1610,m106,GEARY,"I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart."
55124,L315758,u1611,m106,GEORGE,"What else did he say, Jake?"
55125,L315757,u1623,m106,ROD,"What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange."
55126,L315747,u1623,m106,ROD,That was set. I'm tellin' you.
55127,L315746,u1611,m106,GEORGE,But the paper ...
55128,L315745,u1623,m106,ROD,Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
55129,L315744,u1611,m106,GEORGE,Why do you say that?
55130,L315743,u1623,m106,ROD,Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
55131,L315788,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy."
55132,L315787,u1611,m106,GEORGE,You think they're connected?
55133,L315764,u1611,m106,GEORGE,Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
55134,L315763,u1612,m106,JACOB,No. Not really ...
55135,L315762,u1611,m106,GEORGE,He say what they looked like?
55136,L315761,u1612,m106,JACOB,"A couple of weeks, I think."
55137,L315760,u1611,m106,GEORGE,How long had that been going on?
55138,L315759,u1612,m106,JACOB,"He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said."
55139,L315756,u1612,m106,JACOB,He told me he was going to Hell.
55140,L315755,u1611,m106,GEORGE,"What do you mean, demons?"
55141,L315797,u1623,m106,ROD,I say you should get a shrink.
55142,L315796,u1612,m106,JACOB,We should get ourselves a lawyer.
55143,L315795,u1623,m106,ROD,"Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you."
55144,L315794,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one."
55145,L315793,u1623,m106,ROD,"Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall."
55146,L315790,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on."
55147,L315789,u1623,m106,ROD,"Not me, buddy."
55148,L315784,u1612,m106,JACOB,"An explosion, just like Paul's."
55149,L315783,u1623,m106,ROD,Dr. Carlson's dead?
55150,L315780,u1623,m106,ROD,Shit!
55151,L315779,u1612,m106,JACOB,"... I've seen them, too."
55152,L315778,u1623,m106,ROD,"It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over."
55153,L315991,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Not tonight, Louis. No more rest."
55154,L315990,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Jake, you need to rest."
55155,L315989,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I'm walking, aren't I?"
55156,L315988,u1616,m106,LOUIS,What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
55157,L315987,u1612,m106,JACOB,"There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis."
55158,L315986,u1616,m106,LOUIS,What are you doing?
55159,L315984,u1616,m106,LOUIS,You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
55160,L315983,u1612,m106,JACOB,What? By myself?
55161,L315982,u1616,m106,LOUIS,Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
55162,L315978,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side."
55163,L315977,u1612,m106,JACOB,I've seen it. It's all pain.
55164,L315976,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Well, I'll see what I can do about it."
55165,L315975,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis."
55166,L315974,u1616,m106,LOUIS,From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
55167,L315973,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?"
55168,L315972,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?"
55169,L315442,u1616,m106,LOUIS,I know.
55170,L315441,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Louis, you're a life saver."
55171,L315440,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you."
55172,L315439,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?"
55173,L315438,u1616,m106,LOUIS,What?
55174,L315437,u1612,m106,JACOB,I had this weird flash just then.
55175,L315436,u1616,m106,LOUIS,I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
55176,L315435,u1612,m106,JACOB,God almighty. What did you do to me?
55177,L315433,u1616,m106,LOUIS,Wiggle your toes.
55178,L315432,u1612,m106,JACOB,I can't relax.
55179,L315431,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong."
55180,L315430,u1612,m106,JACOB,"What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos."
55181,L315429,u1616,m106,LOUIS,Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
55182,L315428,u1612,m106,JACOB,"What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in."
55183,L315427,u1616,m106,LOUIS,You should go back to her.
55184,L315426,u1612,m106,JACOB,"She hates me, Louis."
55185,L315425,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake."
55186,L315424,u1612,m106,JACOB,Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
55187,L315423,u1616,m106,LOUIS,She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
55188,L315422,u1612,m106,JACOB,I thought you said she didn't say much.
55189,L315421,u1616,m106,LOUIS,She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
55190,L315420,u1612,m106,JACOB,"She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that."
55191,L315419,u1616,m106,LOUIS,She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
55192,L315418,u1612,m106,JACOB,She talk about the boys?
55193,L315417,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Ah, good. Now turn to your left."
55194,L315416,u1616,m106,LOUIS,Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
55195,L315415,u1612,m106,JACOB,Sarah.
55196,L315414,u1616,m106,LOUIS,Who?
55197,L315413,u1612,m106,JACOB,I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
55198,L315412,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Turn on your right side.  How about the other ""right?""  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left."
55199,L315411,u1612,m106,JACOB,What did she have to say?
55200,L315410,u1616,m106,LOUIS,A bit.
55201,L315409,u1612,m106,JACOB,Her knee acting up?
55202,L315408,u1616,m106,LOUIS,I saw Sarah the other day.
55203,L315407,u1612,m106,JACOB,What can I tell you?
55204,L315406,u1616,m106,LOUIS,I know you. How come you're so tense today?
55205,L315405,u1612,m106,JACOB,How do you know?
55206,L315404,u1616,m106,LOUIS,"Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt."
55207,L316235,u1625,m106,STERN,"I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been ""elected"" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing."
55208,L316234,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Hell, you think I am?"
55209,L316233,u1625,m106,STERN,"Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint."
55210,L316232,u1612,m106,JACOB,But I see them.
55211,L316231,u1625,m106,STERN,"Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves."
55212,L316230,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me."
55213,L316229,u1625,m106,STERN,"Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?"
55214,L316228,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I need your insight, your intuition."
55215,L316227,u1625,m106,STERN,I don't know what to say.
55216,L316226,u1612,m106,JACOB,Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
55217,L316225,u1625,m106,STERN,Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
55218,L316224,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Christ, I know how it sounds."
55219,L316223,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life."
55220,L316222,u1625,m106,STERN,"I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now."
55221,L316221,u1612,m106,JACOB,Yes.
55222,L316220,u1625,m106,STERN,See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
55223,L316219,u1612,m106,JACOB,No.  I see them.
55224,L316218,u1625,m106,STERN,"Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?"
55225,L316217,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons."
55226,L316216,u1625,m106,STERN,"Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it."
55227,L316215,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady."
55228,L316214,u1625,m106,STERN,"Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?"
55229,L316213,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos."
55230,L316212,u1625,m106,STERN,Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
55231,L316211,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all."
55232,L316210,u1625,m106,STERN,Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
55233,L316209,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch."
55234,L316208,u1625,m106,STERN,Ah!
55235,L316207,u1612,m106,JACOB,I haven't seen her in months.
55236,L316206,u1625,m106,STERN,"And how is your wife? Sarah, no?"
55237,L316205,u1625,m106,STERN,Likewise.
55238,L316204,u1612,m106,JACOB,It's good to see you.
55239,L316203,u1625,m106,STERN,"Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that."
55240,L316202,u1612,m106,JACOB,The postal service. I'm a mailman.
55241,L316201,u1625,m106,STERN,Are you in the service?
55242,L315483,u1612,m106,JACOB,Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
55243,L315482,u1621,m106,RECEPTIONIST,If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
55244,L315481,u1612,m106,JACOB,That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
55245,L315480,u1621,m106,RECEPTIONIST,You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
55246,L315479,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Whataya mean, no record?"
55247,L315478,u1621,m106,RECEPTIONIST,I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
55248,L315477,u1612,m106,JACOB,Jacob Singer.
55249,L315476,u1621,m106,RECEPTIONIST,What's your name?
55250,L315475,u1612,m106,JACOB,Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
55251,L315474,u1621,m106,RECEPTIONIST,Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
55252,L315473,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes."
55253,L315472,u1621,m106,RECEPTIONIST,Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
55254,L315471,u1612,m106,JACOB,New? He's been here for years.
55255,L315470,u1621,m106,RECEPTIONIST,Carlson? Is he new here?
55256,L315469,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please."
55257,L315946,u1612,m106,JACOB,Save me!
55258,L315945,u1624,m106,SARAH,"Jacob, what can I do?"
55259,L315939,u1624,m106,SARAH,No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
55260,L315938,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm not dead. I am not dead.
55261,L315623,u1624,m106,SARAH,I thought you said it was a nightmare?
55262,L315622,u1612,m106,JACOB,She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
55263,L315621,u1624,m106,SARAH,Go to sleep.
55264,L315620,u1612,m106,JACOB,"She was good in bed, though."
55265,L315619,u1624,m106,SARAH,"Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?"
55266,L315618,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice."
55267,L315617,u1624,m106,SARAH,I don't want to know.
55268,L315616,u1612,m106,JACOB,What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
55269,L315615,u1612,m106,JACOB,This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
55270,L315614,u1624,m106,SARAH,It's not healthy with it closed.
55271,L315613,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed."
55272,L315612,u1624,m106,SARAH,I'm not cold.
55273,L315611,u1612,m106,JACOB,It's freezing.
55274,L315610,u1624,m106,SARAH,What was that?
55275,L315909,u1612,m106,JACOB,Goddamn it. I want Louis.
55276,L315908,u1622,m106,RESIDENT,I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
55277,L315907,u1612,m106,JACOB,No. Don't move me.
55278,L315906,u1622,m106,RESIDENT,"I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little."
55279,L315901,u1622,m106,RESIDENT,We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
55280,L315900,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
55281,L315899,u1622,m106,RESIDENT,Who did?
55282,L315898,u1612,m106,JACOB,They stole it.
55283,L315894,u1622,m106,RESIDENT,Your back? Did you fall?
55284,L315893,u1612,m106,JACOB,My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
55285,L316327,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You know who I am.
55286,L316326,u1612,m106,JACOB,"TELL ME, DAMN YOU!"
55287,L316325,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
55288,L316324,u1612,m106,JACOB,WHO ARE YOU?
55289,L316322,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up."
55290,L316321,u1612,m106,JACOB,Goddamn you!
55291,L316320,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?"
55292,L316319,u1612,m106,JACOB,Oh God!
55293,L316318,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer."
55294,L316317,u1612,m106,JACOB,This isn't happening.
55295,L316315,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
55296,L316314,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where have they gone?
55297,L316313,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"It's over, Jake. It's all over."
55298,L316312,u1612,m106,JACOB,No! What's going on? Where's my family?
55299,L316311,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Sit down!
55300,L316310,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where are they?
55301,L316309,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Sit down, Jake."
55302,L316308,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
55303,L316300,u1612,m106,JACOB,Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
55304,L316299,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Do what? I haven't done a thing.
55305,L316298,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Stop it, Jez. Don't do that."
55306,L316297,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack."
55307,L316296,u1612,m106,JACOB,Don't be funny.
55308,L316295,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Where's West? New Jersey?
55309,L316294,u1612,m106,JACOB,West.
55310,L316293,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Oh?  Where you going?
55311,L316292,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez."
55312,L316291,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
55313,L316290,u1612,m106,JACOB,Mid-town mostly.
55314,L316289,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
55315,L316288,u1612,m106,JACOB,Then don't bug me.
55316,L316287,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You can have anything you want.
55317,L316286,u1612,m106,JACOB,Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
55318,L316285,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
55319,L316284,u1612,m106,JACOB,Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
55320,L316283,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
55321,L316282,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm tired.
55322,L316281,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Jake, what is it?"
55323,L316280,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm not upset.
55324,L316279,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You look upset.
55325,L316278,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
55326,L316277,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?"
55327,L316272,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!"
55328,L316271,u1612,m106,JACOB,Well leave then. Go to Hell.
55329,L316270,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
55330,L316269,u1612,m106,JACOB,You know goddamn well what I mean.
55331,L316268,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
55332,L316267,u1612,m106,JACOB,"That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana."
55333,L316266,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You've lived with me for two years.
55334,L316265,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't know you.
55335,L316264,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
55336,L316263,u1612,m106,JACOB,Why won't you answer me?
55337,L316256,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me."
55338,L316255,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now."
55339,L316251,u1612,m106,JACOB,"With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away."
55340,L316250,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,So tell me ... am I still an angel?
55341,L316179,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
55342,L316178,u1612,m106,JACOB,"TELL ME, DAMN YOU!"
55343,L316177,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
55344,L316176,u1612,m106,JACOB,WHO ARE YOU?
55345,L316172,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!"
55346,L316171,u1612,m106,JACOB,Who are you? What are you doing to me?
55347,L316170,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?"
55348,L316169,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer."
55349,L316168,u1612,m106,JACOB,What's going on?
55350,L316167,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
55351,L316166,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where have they gone?
55352,L316165,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"It's over, Jake. It's all over."
55353,L316164,u1612,m106,JACOB,No! What's going on? Where's my family?
55354,L316163,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Sit down.
55355,L316162,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where are they?
55356,L316161,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Sit down, Jake."
55357,L316160,u1612,m106,JACOB,What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
55358,L316132,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
55359,L316131,u1612,m106,JACOB,I love you when you're angry.
55360,L316130,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
55361,L316129,u1612,m106,JACOB,"No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable."
55362,L316128,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Please.
55363,L316127,u1612,m106,JACOB,I promise.
55364,L316126,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Bullshit!
55365,L316125,u1612,m106,JACOB,No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
55366,L316124,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I can waitress. I'm good.
55367,L316123,u1612,m106,JACOB,"It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone."
55368,L316122,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go."
55369,L316121,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Stick with me, kid."
55370,L316120,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen."
55371,L316117,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,It's so hard to believe.
55372,L316116,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie."
55373,L316115,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next."
55374,L316114,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,What's gotten into you?
55375,L316113,u1612,m106,JACOB,Me neither.
55376,L316112,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"God, I can't keep up with all your changes."
55377,L316111,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez."
55378,L316110,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Are you out of your mind?
55379,L316109,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
55380,L316108,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do."
55381,L316033,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,How do you know he's telling the truth?
55382,L316032,u1612,m106,JACOB,I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
55383,L316031,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,How?
55384,L316030,u1612,m106,JACOB,A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
55385,L316029,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Who was that?
55386,L316027,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
55387,L316026,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
55388,L316025,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,It might be for me.
55389,L316024,u1612,m106,JACOB,Don't!
55390,L316023,u1612,m106,JACOB,I can do anything I want.
55391,L316022,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
55392,L316021,u1612,m106,JACOB,You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
55393,L316020,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I want to know. You tell me!
55394,L316019,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Stay away from me, Jez."
55395,L316018,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?"
55396,L316017,u1612,m106,JACOB,Let go!
55397,L316016,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Who else were you expecting?
55398,L316015,u1612,m106,JACOB,Jezzie?
55399,L316014,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,It's just me.
55400,L315837,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something."
55401,L315836,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't believe this.
55402,L315835,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said."
55403,L315834,u1612,m106,JACOB,What's he talking about?
55404,L315833,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,He said you didn't have one.
55405,L315832,u1612,m106,JACOB,What? What do you mean?
55406,L315831,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case."
55407,L315830,u1612,m106,JACOB,Why didn't you call me?
55408,L315829,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,While you were in the shower.
55409,L315828,u1612,m106,JACOB,He did? When?
55410,L315827,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called."
55411,L315826,u1612,m106,JACOB,"In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real."
55412,L315825,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,How come? The army?
55413,L315824,u1612,m106,JACOB,You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
55414,L315823,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Remember that.
55415,L315822,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Underneath all the bullshit, just love."
55416,L315821,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I know.
55417,L315820,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I love you, Jez."
55418,L315819,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see."
55419,L315818,u1612,m106,JACOB,"With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away."
55420,L315817,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,So tell me ... am I still an angel?
55421,L315664,u1612,m106,JACOB,You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
55422,L315663,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?"
55423,L315660,u1612,m106,JACOB,What?
55424,L315659,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?"
55425,L315658,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up."
55426,L315657,u1612,m106,JACOB,Are we in Brooklyn?
55427,L315656,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' ""Sarah, close the window,"" over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?"
55428,L315655,u1612,m106,JACOB,Am I home?
55429,L315654,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine."
55430,L315596,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Here. I'll do it.
55431,L315595,u1612,m106,JACOB,Help me! Help me!
55432,L315585,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Hey, I'm not dressed."
55433,L315584,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Sam, Tony, come in here."
55434,L315583,u1612,m106,JACOB,Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
55435,L315582,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Lie down!
55436,L315581,u1612,m106,JACOB,Don't gimme that.
55437,L315580,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,What kind of man are you?
55438,L315579,u1612,m106,JACOB,I can't do it.
55439,L315577,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice."
55440,L315576,u1612,m106,JACOB,Look at me. I'm ice cold.
55441,L315575,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,That's your decision.
55442,L315574,u1612,m106,JACOB,You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
55443,L315573,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
55444,L315572,u1612,m106,JACOB,Coming here?
55445,L315571,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,He's coming right over.
55446,L315570,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
55447,L315569,u1612,m106,JACOB,What'd the doctor say?
55448,L315568,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Get your clothes off!
55449,L315567,u1612,m106,JACOB,What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
55450,L315566,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Get your clothes off.
55451,L315565,u1612,m106,JACOB,What the hell are you doin'?
55452,L315564,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,The numbers stop at 107.
55453,L315563,u1612,m106,JACOB,How high is that?
55454,L315562,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,It's gone to the top.
55455,L315561,u1612,m106,JACOB,What does it say?
55456,L315560,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
55457,L315559,u1612,m106,JACOB,What's it say? A hundred and two?
55458,L315550,u1612,m106,JACOB,"If I could stop it, I'd stop it."
55459,L315549,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Can't you stop it?
55460,L315537,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Hey, I'm here."
55461,L315536,u1612,m106,JACOB,Show me Della!
55462,L315535,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Why? What for?
55463,L315534,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where's Della? Bring her here?
55464,L315533,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,What do you mean? Where do you think?
55465,L315532,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where?
55466,L315531,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,We're at Della's.
55467,L315530,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where are we?
55468,L315529,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Oh, come on. It's early."
55469,L315528,u1612,m106,JACOB,I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
55470,L315527,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You okay?
55471,L315461,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Come on. What were they, Jake?"
55472,L315460,u1612,m106,JACOB,They weren't human!
55473,L315459,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
55474,L315458,u1612,m106,JACOB,Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
55475,L315457,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is."
55476,L315456,u1612,m106,JACOB,"They're like demons, Jez."
55477,L315455,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
55478,L315454,u1612,m106,JACOB,What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
55479,L315453,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ..."
55480,L315451,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
55481,L315450,u1612,m106,JACOB,When was the last time I said a word?
55482,L315449,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,'Cause she's always on your mind.
55483,L315448,u1612,m106,JACOB,Why do you bring her up?
55484,L315447,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife."
55485,L315402,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I enjoy crushing into you.
55486,L315401,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
55487,L315400,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it."
55488,L315399,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
55489,L315398,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me."
55490,L315397,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,What's wrong?
55491,L315396,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm going home.
55492,L315395,u1612,m106,JACOB,How's it going?
55493,L315394,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Jake!
55494,L315374,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
55495,L315373,u1612,m106,JACOB,Ready?
55496,L315370,u1612,m106,JACOB,I just want to look ...
55497,L315369,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I don't like things that make you cry.
55498,L315368,u1612,m106,JACOB,Wait. Don't.
55499,L315366,u1612,m106,JACOB,Gabe.
55500,L315365,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Is that the one who died?
55501,L315363,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Well, you didn't marry her."
55502,L315362,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Not to me.
55503,L315361,u1612,m106,JACOB,She looked good then.
55504,L315360,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Look at her face. A real bitch.
55505,L315359,u1612,m106,JACOB,What do you mean you can see?
55506,L315358,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Why you left.
55507,L315357,u1612,m106,JACOB,What?
55508,L315356,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
55509,L315355,u1612,m106,JACOB,Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
55510,L315354,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Lemme see.
55511,L315353,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida."
55512,L315352,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so ""what's his name"" brought 'em over on his way to school."
55513,L315351,u1612,m106,JACOB,What's in here?
55514,L315350,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Jake, you are never out of your head!"
55515,L315349,u1612,m106,JACOB,I must have been out of my head.
55516,L315348,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,The best.
55517,L315347,u1612,m106,JACOB,And look what I got.
55518,L315346,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,A good lay.
55519,L315345,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Yeah, but for what?"
55520,L315344,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me."
55521,L315343,u1612,m106,JACOB,"You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?"
55522,L315342,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I don't let anybody call me that.
55523,L315341,u1612,m106,JACOB,And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
55524,L315340,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Well, personally, I never went for church names."
55525,L315339,u1612,m106,JACOB,They're Biblical. They were prophets.
55526,L315338,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,They're weird names.
55527,L315337,u1612,m106,JACOB,Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
55528,L315336,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,No. The little one.
55529,L315335,u1612,m106,JACOB,Who? Jed?
55530,L315334,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Your kid dropped it off.
55531,L315333,u1612,m106,JACOB,Thanks.  What's that?
55532,L315332,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
55533,L315331,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Jezzie, I can't see."
55534,L315330,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Did you look around the headboard?
55535,L315329,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't know.
55536,L315328,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Where'd you leave 'em?
55537,L315327,u1612,m106,JACOB,No. Have you seen my glasses?
55538,L315326,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,You up?
55539,L315324,u1612,m106,JACOB,Don't ask.
55540,L315323,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,What happened to you?
55541,L315322,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time."
55542,L315321,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
55543,L315320,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow."
55544,L315319,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,The room!
55545,L315318,u1612,m106,JACOB,What do you mean?
55546,L315317,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,What do you think?
55547,L315316,u1612,m106,JACOB,Thanks.
55548,L315315,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,That help?
55549,L315314,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where to?
55550,L315313,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,I moved the couch. That's all.
55551,L315312,u1612,m106,JACOB,If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
55552,L315311,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Where are you?
55553,L315310,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where is the lamp?
55554,L315309,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Gee, thanks a lot."
55555,L315308,u1612,m106,JACOB,I didn't want to wake you.
55556,L315307,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Why didn't you turn on the light?
55557,L315306,u1612,m106,JACOB,"What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?"
55558,L315305,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,"Jake, is that you?"
55559,L316107,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
55560,L316106,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't know what to say.
55561,L316105,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be."
55562,L316104,u1612,m106,JACOB,No. I couldn't.
55563,L316103,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
55564,L316101,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
55565,L316100,u1612,m106,JACOB,I would have stayed there if I could.
55566,L316099,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
55567,L316098,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Mike, it was real. It was glorious."
55568,L316097,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Well that's good to know.
55569,L316096,u1612,m106,JACOB,"It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there."
55570,L316095,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Better living through chemistry, that's my motto."
55571,L316094,u1612,m106,JACOB,"I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle."
55572,L316093,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
55573,L316087,u1612,m106,JACOB,What's happening? Help me.
55574,L316086,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Just relax.
55575,L316085,u1612,m106,JACOB,I can't move.
55576,L316084,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Pleasant dreams.
55577,L316083,u1612,m106,JACOB,I think I'm falling asleep.
55578,L316082,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,It's strong stuff.
55579,L316081,u1612,m106,JACOB,One drop?
55580,L316080,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"""Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil,"" but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax."
55581,L316079,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't know.
55582,L316078,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
55583,L316077,u1612,m106,JACOB,What is it?
55584,L316076,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
55585,L316075,u1612,m106,JACOB,Never?
55586,L316074,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
55587,L316073,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me."
55588,L316072,u1612,m106,JACOB,"How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?"
55589,L316071,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Sometimes. When it's convenient.
55590,L316070,u1612,m106,JACOB,You come here often?
55591,L316069,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help."
55592,L316068,u1612,m106,JACOB,So why tell me now?
55593,L316067,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business."
55594,L316066,u1612,m106,JACOB,"If you knew, why didn't you say anything?"
55595,L316065,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
55596,L316061,u1612,m106,JACOB,Who then?
55597,L316060,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,Yeah. But not with the Cong.
55598,L316059,u1612,m106,JACOB,"But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?"
55599,L316058,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
55600,L316057,u1612,m106,JACOB,None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
55601,L316055,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought."
55602,L316054,u1612,m106,JACOB,Like it was yesterday.
55603,L316053,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember."
55604,L316051,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know."
55605,L316050,u1612,m106,JACOB,The Ladder?
55606,L316049,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder."
55607,L316048,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Yeah, sure. We were losing the war."
55608,L316047,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies."
55609,L316046,u1612,m106,JACOB,Shows how much you knew.
55610,L316045,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse."
55611,L316044,u1612,m106,JACOB,Long time ago.
55612,L316043,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68."
55613,L316041,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors."
55614,L316040,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
55615,L316039,u1617,m106,MICHAEL,"Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight."
55616,L315386,u1627,m106,WOMAN,If you're lucky.
55617,L315385,u1612,m106,JACOB,"No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably."
55618,L315384,u1627,m106,WOMAN,"Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?"
55619,L315383,u1612,m106,JACOB,"You got a nice tan, though."
55620,L315382,u1627,m106,WOMAN,Hot. Where do I sign?
55621,L315381,u1612,m106,JACOB,How was Palm Springs?
55622,L315380,u1627,m106,WOMAN,"That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired."
55623,L315379,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where's Wong?
55624,L315378,u1627,m106,WOMAN,I know. That's why I'm asking.
55625,L315377,u1612,m106,JACOB,They're awfully heavy.
55626,L315376,u1627,m106,WOMAN,How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
55627,L315298,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Yeah, you and everyone else."
55628,L315297,u1627,m106,WOMAN,I no from around here.
55629,L315296,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep."
55630,L316241,u1612,m106,JACOB,Help me!
55631,L316240,u1626,m106,VOICE,Push 'em back.
55632,L316239,u1626,m106,VOICE,That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
55633,L316238,u1626,m106,VOICE,He'll never make it.
55634,L316237,u1626,m106,VOICE,Total delirium.
55635,L316236,u1626,m106,VOICE,He's burning up.
55636,L316139,u1612,m106,JACOB,What?!
55637,L316138,u1626,m106,VOICE,Dream on!
55638,L316009,u1612,m106,JACOB,What is wrong with you?
55639,L316008,u1626,m106,VOICE,Clear the area. This is an order!

55641,L316000,u1612,m106,JACOB,You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
55642,L315999,u1626,m106,VOICE,Please come quietly.
55643,L315998,u1612,m106,JACOB,For what? For seeking the truth?
55644,L315997,u1626,m106,VOICE,"Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest."

55646,L315522,u1626,m106,VOICE,Push 'em back.
55647,L315521,u1626,m106,VOICE,That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
55648,L315520,u1626,m106,VOICE,Total delirium.
55649,L315519,u1626,m106,VOICE,He's burning up.
55650,L315958,u1619,m106,NURSE,Of course it is. What else could it be?
55651,L315957,u1612,m106,JACOB,This is not a dream! This is my life.
55652,L315956,u1612,m106,JACOB,Last night! They were as real as you are!
55653,L315955,u1619,m106,NURSE,I'm sorry.
55654,L315954,u1612,m106,JACOB,That's a lie. My family was here.
55655,L315953,u1619,m106,NURSE,No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
55656,L315952,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
55657,L315951,u1619,m106,NURSE,You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
55658,L315950,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm awake?
55659,L315949,u1619,m106,NURSE,Lennox Hospital.
55660,L315948,u1612,m106,JACOB,Where am I?
55661,L315947,u1619,m106,NURSE,"Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?"
55662,L315905,u1612,m106,JACOB,Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
55663,L315904,u1619,m106,NURSE,We're doing everything we can.
55664,L315903,u1612,m106,JACOB,Call my chiropractor.
55665,L315902,u1619,m106,NURSE,I'll page him.
55666,L315732,u1612,m106,JACOB,Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
55667,L315731,u1620,m106,PAUL,What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
55668,L315730,u1612,m106,JACOB,You come home with me.
55669,L315729,u1620,m106,PAUL,I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
55670,L315728,u1620,m106,PAUL,"They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something."
55671,L315727,u1612,m106,JACOB,I don't know. I don't know.
55672,L315726,u1620,m106,PAUL,"She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?"
55673,L315725,u1612,m106,JACOB,The army?
55674,L315724,u1620,m106,PAUL,"They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army."
55675,L315723,u1612,m106,JACOB,What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
55676,L315722,u1620,m106,PAUL,Oh God. I know. I know.
55677,L315721,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams."
55678,L315720,u1620,m106,PAUL,God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
55679,L315719,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Everywhere, like a plague."
55680,L315718,u1620,m106,PAUL,You've seen them?
55681,L315717,u1612,m106,JACOB,I've seen them too ... the demons!
55682,L315716,u1620,m106,PAUL,What do you mean?
55683,L315715,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about."
55684,L315714,u1620,m106,PAUL,I don't know what to do.
55685,L315713,u1612,m106,JACOB,"It's okay, Paul. It's okay."
55686,L315711,u1620,m106,PAUL,"They're waitin' for me, that's why."
55687,L315710,u1612,m106,JACOB,Why not?
55688,L315709,u1620,m106,PAUL,"I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home."
55689,L315708,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?"
55690,L315707,u1620,m106,PAUL,Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
55691,L315706,u1620,m106,PAUL,They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
55692,L315705,u1612,m106,JACOB,Who is?
55693,L315704,u1620,m106,PAUL,That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
55694,L315701,u1620,m106,PAUL,Yeah.
55695,L315700,u1612,m106,JACOB,You in trouble?
55696,L315699,u1620,m106,PAUL,I don't know.
55697,L315698,u1612,m106,JACOB,What's goin' on Paul?
55698,L315697,u1620,m106,PAUL,Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
55699,L315696,u1612,m106,JACOB,That black car?
55700,L315695,u1620,m106,PAUL,"Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?"
55701,L315694,u1612,m106,JACOB,What's wrong?
55702,L315693,u1620,m106,PAUL,I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
55703,L315692,u1612,m106,JACOB,You can't talk in Brownsville?
55704,L315691,u1620,m106,PAUL,I just need to talk.
55705,L315690,u1612,m106,JACOB,Why the hell we drivin' here?
55706,L315689,u1620,m106,PAUL,You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
55707,L315688,u1612,m106,JACOB,Nope.
55708,L315687,u1620,m106,PAUL,"Still married, Jake?"
55709,L315686,u1620,m106,PAUL,"You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?"
55710,L315685,u1612,m106,JACOB,It's not worth it. You'll never win.
55711,L315684,u1620,m106,PAUL,No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
55712,L315683,u1612,m106,JACOB,"It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?"
55713,L315682,u1620,m106,PAUL,Count 'em on one hand.
55714,L315681,u1612,m106,JACOB,You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
55715,L315680,u1620,m106,PAUL,I work in a bakery.
55716,L315679,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds."
55717,L315678,u1620,m106,PAUL,I need to see you.
55718,L315677,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick."
55719,L315676,u1620,m106,PAUL,"I need to see you, Jake."
55720,L315675,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?"
55721,L315674,u1620,m106,PAUL,Nothin' much.
55722,L315673,u1612,m106,JACOB,Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
55723,L315672,u1620,m106,PAUL,A long time.
55724,L315671,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?"
55725,L315670,u1612,m106,JACOB,Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
55726,L315669,u1620,m106,PAUL,Paul Gruneger!
55727,L315668,u1612,m106,JACOB,Speaking.
55728,L315667,u1620,m106,PAUL,Jacob Singer?
55729,L315666,u1612,m106,JACOB,Hello.
55730,L315497,u1612,m106,JACOB,No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
55731,L315496,u1615,m106,LEADER,Do you want me to get someone?
55732,L315495,u1612,m106,JACOB,Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
55733,L315494,u1615,m106,LEADER,No one knows. They say it blew up.
55734,L315493,u1612,m106,JACOB,How did it happen?
55735,L315492,u1615,m106,LEADER,"Last month, before Thanksgiving."
55736,L315491,u1612,m106,JACOB,"Jesus, Jesus! ... When?"
55737,L315490,u1615,m106,LEADER,A car accident.
55738,L315489,u1612,m106,JACOB,Died?
55739,L315488,u1615,m106,LEADER,I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
55740,L315487,u1612,m106,JACOB,I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
55741,L315486,u1615,m106,LEADER,Can I help you?
55742,L315607,u1618,m106,MRS. CARMICHAEL,Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
55743,L315606,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
55744,L315605,u1618,m106,MRS. CARMICHAEL,On top of him?
55745,L315604,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Pour it in.
55746,L315603,u1618,m106,MRS. CARMICHAEL,I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
55747,L315602,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,He doesn't like it.
55748,L315601,u1618,m106,MRS. CARMICHAEL,Is he all right?
55749,L315600,u1614,m106,JEZZIE,Bring it in.
55750,L315599,u1618,m106,MRS. CARMICHAEL,I have some ice from the machine.
55751,L317672,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,"Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on."
55752,L317671,u1631,m107,DALLAS,"I don't have all day, kid."
55753,L317669,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,"Alright, asshole."
55754,L317668,u1631,m107,DALLAS,"Okay, enough of this shit."
55755,L317667,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,"Oh, come on!"
55756,L317666,u1631,m107,DALLAS,Yes it does.
55757,L317665,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,Asshole that does not count as a kill.
55758,L317662,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
55759,L317661,u1631,m107,DALLAS,He's not part of the program.
55760,L317660,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,Pause play.
55761,L317659,u1631,m107,DALLAS,That sucks. Why won't he go down?
55762,L317656,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,"Speaking of which, duck!"
55763,L317655,u1631,m107,DALLAS,You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
55764,L317654,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,You got lucky.
55765,L317653,u1631,m107,DALLAS,"That's nine to four, geek-boy."
55766,L317476,u1631,m107,DALLAS,Punk?
55767,L317475,u1628,m107,AZRAEL,"Watch it punk, I'm armed."
55768,L318316,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good."
55769,L318315,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine."
55770,L318269,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Delongpre! Out of time!
55771,L318268,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar."
55772,L318243,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Done?
55773,L318242,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done."
55774,L318222,u1639,m107,RIZZO,We made it?
55775,L318221,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Minimal.
55776,L318182,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I don't know. Nothing.
55777,L318181,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,What?
55778,L318180,u1639,m107,RIZZO,His mother?
55779,L318151,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
55780,L318150,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Can we blow it with just two?
55781,L318124,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,We don't have a choice!
55782,L318123,u1639,m107,RIZZO,We can't lead him into the other hull!
55783,L318042,u1639,m107,RIZZO,What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
55784,L318041,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"When the left hull goes, so will the right."
55785,L318024,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
55786,L318023,u1639,m107,RIZZO,What's that?
55787,L318011,u1639,m107,RIZZO,No.
55788,L318010,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
55789,L318009,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"If the ship goes, so does Jaso."
55790,L318008,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,What are you doing?!!
55791,L318006,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!"
55792,L318005,u1639,m107,RIZZO,It's locked!
55793,L317971,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Could you show a little compassion?!
55794,L317970,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out."
55795,L317969,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Goodbye old friend.
55796,L317961,u1639,m107,RIZZO,We don't have time to argue!
55797,L317960,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,We're not leaving Crutch!
55798,L317959,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks."
55799,L317919,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"What do you mean, not enough time?"
55800,L317918,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!"
55801,L317782,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here."
55802,L317781,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Duck fuckers?
55803,L318306,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Get out of here!
55804,L318305,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Sergeant!
55805,L318250,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
55806,L318249,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Can't shut em' down from here.
55807,L318172,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Rizzo did.
55808,L318171,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
55809,L318163,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
55810,L318162,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Bomb?
55811,L318159,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?"
55812,L318158,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Sergeant? We thought you were...
55813,L318157,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!"
55814,L318133,u1634,m107,JANESSA,"He came for me, I had to run!"
55815,L318132,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Where the hell were you?!!
55816,L318120,u1634,m107,JANESSA,He....He...
55817,L318119,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Where have you been?!!
55818,L317992,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Thorgan, pull us in."
55819,L317991,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Okay that hurt.
55820,L317941,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Kkinsa! Open the doors!
55821,L317940,u1634,m107,JANESSA,What?!
55822,L317939,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Uh-oh.
55823,L318291,u1640,m107,THORGAN,This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
55824,L318290,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Thorgan, suit up."
55825,L318289,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Goodbye, my love."
55826,L318187,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Let's move out!
55827,L318186,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Done!
55828,L318185,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Two more charges to go.
55829,L318184,u1640,m107,THORGAN,As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
55830,L318174,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,What are you doing back?!!
55831,L318173,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Kay-Em!
55832,L318094,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"I'm coming, I'm coming."
55833,L318093,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!"
55834,L318062,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there."
55835,L318061,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Hey! I'm not ready.
55836,L318058,u1640,m107,THORGAN,They're back here.
55837,L318057,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,I'll need system four converters.
55838,L318050,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"What are you gonna do, tell me?"
55839,L318049,u1640,m107,THORGAN,We're not supposed to do that.
55840,L318002,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
55841,L318001,u1640,m107,THORGAN,The hull's imploding!
55842,L318000,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Shit!
55843,L317965,u1640,m107,THORGAN,I think I broke my arm.
55844,L317964,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Everyone okay?
55845,L317914,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Where'd you get the gun?
55846,L317913,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Better let me.
55847,L317760,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,"Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage."
55848,L317759,u1640,m107,THORGAN,You see that?
55849,L317444,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,And you said high school was boring.
55850,L317443,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Nice touch.
55851,L317349,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Cool.
55852,L317348,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Creepy.
55853,L318311,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Hey, easy now."
55854,L318310,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
55855,L318309,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Boeman, the ships not here."
55856,L318283,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Suit up.
55857,L318282,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Earth II.
55858,L318241,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,And now we're all out of it.
55859,L318240,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,It bought us some time.
55860,L318211,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Faster! Don't we have another gun?
55861,L318210,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Hurry!
55862,L318153,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,I don't know!
55863,L318152,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Then what do we do?!
55864,L318141,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Then stop talking and work faster!
55865,L318140,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
55866,L318118,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
55867,L318117,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Where is...?
55868,L318070,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Thorgan? You coming?!
55869,L318069,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
55870,L318060,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Bring 'em all. Let's move!
55871,L318059,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,How many?
55872,L318048,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,We could convert fission transistors.
55873,L318047,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,We'd need charges.
55874,L317645,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?"
55875,L317644,u1629,m107,BOEMAN,Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
55876,L317797,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,What?
55877,L317796,u1641,m107,YLLO,Sergeant!
55878,L317777,u1641,m107,YLLO,But I didn't see...
55879,L317776,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
55880,L317775,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Ok Sarge, what's your status?"
55881,L317745,u1641,m107,YLLO,Yeah yeah. Got it.
55882,L317744,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,You just keep an eye out.
55883,L317743,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though."
55884,L317738,u1641,m107,YLLO,At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
55885,L317737,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
55886,L317719,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,You got that right.
55887,L317718,u1641,m107,YLLO,JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
55888,L317717,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Not a chance.
55889,L317716,u1641,m107,YLLO,"ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends."
55890,L317707,u1641,m107,YLLO,Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
55891,L317706,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Yllo, what's your head count?"
55892,L317615,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
55893,L317614,u1641,m107,YLLO,Wait a minute...I need...
55894,L317577,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it."
55895,L317576,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,My job.
55896,L317575,u1641,m107,YLLO,What the hell are you doing?
55897,L317474,u1641,m107,YLLO,"That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with."
55898,L317473,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Jesus what the hell is that?
55899,L317472,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -"
55900,L317471,u1641,m107,YLLO,I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
55901,L317470,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
55902,L317469,u1641,m107,YLLO,I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
55903,L317468,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it."
55904,L317467,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her."
55905,L317466,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
55906,L317461,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
55907,L317460,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!"
55908,L317459,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,You're a teacher.
55909,L317458,u1641,m107,YLLO,I am an expert!
55910,L317457,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . ."
55911,L317453,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
55912,L317452,u1641,m107,YLLO,Get them in the lab!
55913,L318239,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
55914,L318238,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,We need weapons.
55915,L317712,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
55916,L317711,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
55917,L317710,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,I need to know what you know about this guy.
55918,L317692,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live."
55919,L317691,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
55920,L317686,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!"
55921,L317685,u1639,m107,RIZZO,He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
55922,L317639,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"No, you're dead! You're all dead!"
55923,L317638,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead."
55924,L317637,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Where is he?
55925,L317636,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,I'm with you kid.
55926,L317769,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
55927,L317768,u1636,m107,KICKER,"Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?"
55928,L317749,u1636,m107,KICKER,Negative.
55929,L317748,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Kicker, anything?"
55930,L317723,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
55931,L317722,u1636,m107,KICKER,Fuckin A...
55932,L317721,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!"
55933,L317703,u1636,m107,KICKER,Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
55934,L317702,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
55935,L317649,u1636,m107,KICKER,"Oh man, what the hell happened?"
55936,L317648,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"Jesus, God!"
55937,L318236,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,"I'm pulling, damnit!"
55938,L318235,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Pull me in!
55939,L318109,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
55940,L318108,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
55941,L318107,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
55942,L318106,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
55943,L318105,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Give me a break! What happened?
55944,L318104,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
55945,L318103,u1630,m107,BRODSKI,Where is everybody? What happened?
55946,L318340,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I get it.
55947,L318339,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great..."
55948,L318338,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Old woman?
55949,L318337,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"No thank you, you crazy old woman."
55950,L318336,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?"
55951,L318335,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,You okay?!
55952,L318333,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I'm stuck!
55953,L318332,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Rizzo, pull away!"
55954,L318330,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,I know you.
55955,L318329,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Delongpre, you don't even know me."
55956,L318326,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"I think so, why?"
55957,L318325,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Did you like it?
55958,L318324,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I think I had some when I was eight.
55959,L318323,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?"
55960,L318321,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?"
55961,L318320,u1639,m107,RIZZO,No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
55962,L318319,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Rizzo, you okay?"
55963,L318314,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,You'll be fine.
55964,L318313,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Okay, good tip."
55965,L318312,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,You wanna release your air tanks?
55966,L318294,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Eat me.
55967,L318293,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
55968,L318292,u1639,m107,RIZZO,His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
55969,L318278,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Oh sure, all the time."
55970,L318277,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Got it.  You ever space walked?
55971,L318256,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
55972,L318255,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,You?
55973,L318254,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it."
55974,L318232,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Not so bad.
55975,L318231,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,See? We're not so bad.
55976,L318100,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?"
55977,L318099,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I couldn't save them.
55978,L318098,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,And what happend to ...?
55979,L318097,u1639,m107,RIZZO,They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
55980,L318089,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Were you close to your father?
55981,L318088,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going."
55982,L318081,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl."
55983,L318080,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I thought you meant...
55984,L318079,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change."
55985,L318078,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up."
55986,L318077,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,That's why I'm here.
55987,L318038,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom."
55988,L318037,u1639,m107,RIZZO,What's this?
55989,L318036,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Hey!!
55990,L318035,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good."
55991,L318034,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Hey.
55992,L318013,u1639,m107,RIZZO,It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
55993,L318012,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Rizzo?!
55994,L317988,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,What if we don't?
55995,L317987,u1639,m107,RIZZO,What if you miss?
55996,L317958,u1639,m107,RIZZO,400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
55997,L317957,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,We're screwed!
55998,L317948,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I guessed.
55999,L317947,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Med-kit?
56000,L317946,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die."
56001,L317944,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work."
56002,L317943,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!"
56003,L317934,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,No you don't!
56004,L317933,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
56005,L317924,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Guys!!! The shuttle?
56006,L317923,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes."
56007,L317830,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
56008,L317829,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Rizzo, he's out there."
56009,L317784,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
56010,L317783,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Outta here?
56011,L317694,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I hope so.
56012,L317693,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to."
56013,L317688,u1639,m107,RIZZO,We have to get off this ship.
56014,L317687,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Where are you going?
56015,L317855,u1641,m107,YLLO,They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
56016,L317854,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe."
56017,L317853,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?"
56018,L317852,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
56019,L317851,u1641,m107,YLLO,We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
56020,L317820,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,No shit. I got no problem with that.
56021,L317819,u1641,m107,YLLO,Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
56022,L317635,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Oh I like her a lot.
56023,L317634,u1641,m107,YLLO,God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
56024,L317629,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?"
56025,L317628,u1641,m107,YLLO,"I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women."
56026,L317627,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,That's really funny.
56027,L317626,u1641,m107,YLLO,"More time...shit, she's had 400 years..."
56028,L317625,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,She needs a little time.
56029,L317624,u1641,m107,YLLO,Well?
56030,L317591,u1641,m107,YLLO,She broke my fucking nose!
56031,L317590,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Spunky . . .
56032,L317574,u1641,m107,YLLO,I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
56033,L317573,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
56034,L317572,u1641,m107,YLLO,It's time.
56035,L317529,u1641,m107,YLLO,We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
56036,L317528,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Now what?
56037,L318328,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Shut up, Thorgan!"
56038,L318327,u1640,m107,THORGAN,He's trying to ask you out on a date.
56039,L318300,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"Well, do something!"
56040,L318299,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Oh, shit. He's going to see us."
56041,L318285,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?"
56042,L318284,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,I'll help you in.
56043,L318275,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Just come on, I've got an idea."
56044,L318274,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Okay?!!
56045,L318245,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Again?! Jesus!
56046,L318244,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Kaboom.
56047,L318092,u1640,m107,THORGAN,I'm on my way.
56048,L318091,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
56049,L317928,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
56050,L317927,u1640,m107,THORGAN,I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
56051,L317894,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,He's right behind us!
56052,L317893,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
56053,L317863,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,We're screwed.
56054,L317862,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Yuck.
56055,L317818,u1640,m107,THORGAN,She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
56056,L317817,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Now hold on! We should hear her out!
56057,L318215,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,NO!
56058,L318214,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Close the fucking door!
56059,L318213,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,They'll make it.
56060,L318212,u1634,m107,JANESSA,They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
56061,L318149,u1634,m107,JANESSA,He was chasing me!
56062,L318148,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,You lost the charge?
56063,L318147,u1634,m107,JANESSA,I...I don't know what I did...
56064,L317983,u1634,m107,JANESSA,"Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there."
56065,L317982,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Push off toward us.
56066,L318288,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you."
56067,L318287,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"I knew you were a little sick, but Geez."
56068,L318248,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
56069,L318247,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,You must shut down the engines.
56070,L318055,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
56071,L318054,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Now this is getting exciting.
56072,L317891,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,"GO, GO, GO!"
56073,L317890,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Now that's just gross.
56074,L317518,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
56075,L317517,u1632,m107,DELONGPRE,And what's with the headgear?
56076,L317774,u1641,m107,YLLO,Thank you.
56077,L317773,u1633,m107,FAT LOU,"Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction."
56078,L317772,u1641,m107,YLLO,We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
56079,L317771,u1633,m107,FAT LOU,I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
56080,L317770,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab."
56081,L317446,u1641,m107,YLLO,Just get us to the ship!
56082,L317445,u1633,m107,FAT LOU,Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
56083,L317357,u1641,m107,YLLO,Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
56084,L317356,u1633,m107,FAT LOU,Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
56085,L317329,u1633,m107,FAT LOU,Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
56086,L317328,u1641,m107,YLLO,I'm missing two!
56087,L318064,u1640,m107,THORGAN,You're leaving me here alone?
56088,L318063,u1634,m107,JANESSA,You're so bossy.
56089,L318053,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Would you?
56090,L318052,u1634,m107,JANESSA,"YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job."
56091,L318030,u1634,m107,JANESSA,"A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?"
56092,L318029,u1640,m107,THORGAN,You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
56093,L318015,u1634,m107,JANESSA,So what else is new?
56094,L318014,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Hurry! She's lost it!
56095,L317998,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Let's just get out of here.
56096,L317997,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not."
56097,L317985,u1634,m107,JANESSA,That ought'a help the situation.
56098,L317984,u1640,m107,THORGAN,I'm gonna spew.
56099,L317516,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Small brains make your balls itch?
56100,L317515,u1640,m107,THORGAN,This is what it means right here.
56101,L317875,u1641,m107,YLLO,Crutch?
56102,L317874,u1634,m107,JANESSA,What do we do?!!
56103,L317835,u1641,m107,YLLO,Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
56104,L317834,u1634,m107,JANESSA,What are you doing?
56105,L317814,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!"
56106,L317813,u1634,m107,JANESSA,"Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?"
56107,L317641,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Oh my God! Adrienne?
56108,L317640,u1641,m107,YLLO,Jesus!
56109,L317542,u1634,m107,JANESSA,You prefer an apple?
56110,L317541,u1641,m107,YLLO,Later.
56111,L317540,u1634,m107,JANESSA,You're quicker than usual.
56112,L318161,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Sergeant, we could use a big bomb."
56113,L318160,u1634,m107,JANESSA,I don't know...sorry?
56114,L318046,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?"
56115,L318045,u1634,m107,JANESSA,I'm just saying.
56116,L318044,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
56117,L318028,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
56118,L318027,u1634,m107,JANESSA,No.
56119,L318017,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
56120,L318016,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
56121,L317647,u1634,m107,JANESSA,Maybe she tripped.
56122,L317646,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves."
56123,L318177,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!"
56124,L318176,u1639,m107,RIZZO,You killed him?
56125,L318175,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
56126,L318026,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Are there any other shuttles?
56127,L318025,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
56128,L317732,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,You need to get laid!
56129,L317731,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I'm surrounded by idiots.
56130,L317730,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,I'm afraid I cannot assist.
56131,L317729,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie..."
56132,L317728,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six..."
56133,L317727,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Barbie from hell...
56134,L317726,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Kay-em 14.
56135,L317725,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Robot huh?
56136,L318345,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,I love you.
56137,L318344,u1640,m107,THORGAN,I missed you too.
56138,L318343,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"I am now. I missed you, Thorgan."
56139,L318342,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Kay-em you okay?
56140,L318225,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could."
56141,L318224,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Kay-Em we made it!
56142,L318179,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
56143,L318178,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you."
56144,L318135,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
56145,L318134,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Kay-Em, you okay?"
56146,L318127,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"Oh, alright."
56147,L318126,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass."
56148,L318125,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Do I have to?
56149,L318084,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Good point.
56150,L318083,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Who are you apologizing to?
56151,L318082,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Sorry, sorry."
56152,L318074,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
56153,L318073,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming."
56154,L318072,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Ow!
56155,L318071,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Almost done.
56156,L318067,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Come here, might as well fix that arm."
56157,L318066,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"It's just you and me, then."
56158,L318033,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Sory...
56159,L318032,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Am I in there?
56160,L318031,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn."
56161,L317953,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Oh shit! There he is!
56162,L317952,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,I didn't say I was good at it.
56163,L317383,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
56164,L317382,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back."
56165,L317339,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
56166,L317338,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
56167,L317337,u1635,m107,KAY-EM 14,"The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid."
56168,L317431,u1641,m107,YLLO,No! He's coming with us!
56169,L317430,u1636,m107,KICKER,Leave him behind!
56170,L317411,u1636,m107,KICKER,Defense droids. I'm on it.
56171,L317410,u1641,m107,YLLO,Kicker!
56172,L317376,u1641,m107,YLLO,This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
56173,L317375,u1636,m107,KICKER,Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
56174,L317374,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!"
56175,L317334,u1636,m107,KICKER,Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
56176,L317333,u1641,m107,YLLO,We're missing two of the kids!
56177,L317332,u1636,m107,KICKER,"Yo, Teach, what the fuck?"
56178,L317898,u1637,m107,KKINSA,But?!!
56179,L317897,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I gotta go back.
56180,L317896,u1637,m107,KKINSA,What?!!
56181,L317895,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
56182,L317873,u1637,m107,KKINSA,Thirty seconds.
56183,L317872,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Then open the doors!
56184,L317871,u1637,m107,KKINSA,The power's back up!
56185,L317858,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Keep trying!
56186,L317857,u1637,m107,KKINSA,Something's wrong.
56187,L317850,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I just know.
56188,L317849,u1637,m107,KKINSA,How do you know?
56189,L317846,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Ssh.
56190,L317845,u1637,m107,KKINSA,What?
56191,L317801,u1639,m107,RIZZO,He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
56192,L317800,u1637,m107,KKINSA,I don't understand...what does he want?
56193,L317553,u1638,m107,PEREZ,See you then . . . doctor.
56194,L317552,u1641,m107,YLLO,I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
56195,L317551,u1638,m107,PEREZ,"If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?"
56196,L317550,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Hypothetically, how much are we talking?"
56197,L317549,u1638,m107,PEREZ,"Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?"
56198,L317548,u1641,m107,YLLO,Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
56199,L317547,u1638,m107,PEREZ,"Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . ."
56200,L317546,u1641,m107,YLLO,I'm sending you the files.
56201,L317545,u1641,m107,YLLO,We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
56202,L317544,u1638,m107,PEREZ,"You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?"
56203,L317889,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Three...two...one...
56204,L317888,u1641,m107,YLLO,"It's okay, he just wanted his machete."
56205,L317828,u1641,m107,YLLO,You're crazy!
56206,L317827,u1639,m107,RIZZO,How do you open the damn door?
56207,L317816,u1641,m107,YLLO,4You're not going anywhere.
56208,L317815,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Guys, please come with me!"
56209,L317812,u1639,m107,RIZZO,That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
56210,L317811,u1641,m107,YLLO,Scientists. Very intellegent men.
56211,L317810,u1639,m107,RIZZO,More soldiers?
56212,L317809,u1641,m107,YLLO,They can deal with this sort of thing.
56213,L317808,u1639,m107,RIZZO,What good will that do?
56214,L317805,u1641,m107,YLLO,Are we locked down?
56215,L317804,u1639,m107,RIZZO,You wanna die?
56216,L317803,u1641,m107,YLLO,You're not going anywhere.
56217,L317690,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
56218,L317689,u1641,m107,YLLO,That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
56219,L317675,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Get him out of there!
56220,L317674,u1641,m107,YLLO,Azrael can you repeat that?
56221,L317652,u1639,m107,RIZZO,I didn't say he was alive.
56222,L317651,u1641,m107,YLLO,Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
56223,L317650,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
56224,L317633,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Are you finished?
56225,L317632,u1641,m107,YLLO,"Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity."
56226,L317631,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Jason? He's on this ship?!
56227,L317612,u1641,m107,YLLO,"That's right, now if you could..."
56228,L317611,u1639,m107,RIZZO,But...I...400 years?
56229,L317610,u1641,m107,YLLO,We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
56230,L317605,u1639,m107,RIZZO,JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
56231,L317604,u1641,m107,YLLO,Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
56232,L317602,u1639,m107,RIZZO,30? How long was I out?
56233,L317601,u1641,m107,YLLO,We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
56234,L317600,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
56235,L317599,u1641,m107,YLLO,Nanotechnology.
56236,L317598,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"How did I get here, how did you bring me back?"
56237,L317596,u1641,m107,YLLO,Obviously so.
56238,L317595,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
56239,L318273,u1640,m107,THORGAN,It's okay.
56240,L318272,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Guys, he's right behind us!"
56241,L318040,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Sure but what good will that do?
56242,L318039,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Can we get through these?
56243,L317826,u1640,m107,THORGAN,"Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there."
56244,L317825,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
56245,L317780,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing."
56246,L317779,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Yes!
56247,L317752,u1640,m107,THORGAN,Exactly.
56248,L317751,u1639,m107,RIZZO,"So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?"
56249,L317643,u1639,m107,RIZZO,What have I done?! Idiots.
56250,L317642,u1640,m107,THORGAN,What have you done?
56251,L317609,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Old Earth?
56252,L317608,u1640,m107,THORGAN,He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
56253,L317607,u1639,m107,RIZZO,Hockey player? He's not a ...
56254,L317606,u1640,m107,THORGAN,The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
56255,L319779,u1642,m108,BRODY,Here --  Take him home.
56256,L319778,u1651,m108,MICHAEL,My cars. And a comic book.
56257,L319765,u1651,m108,MICHAEL,"Sure, Dad."
56258,L319764,u1642,m108,BRODY,Just a favor for your old man.
56259,L319763,u1651,m108,MICHAEL,"Dad, the ponds are for old ladies."
56260,L319762,u1642,m108,BRODY,Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
56261,L319761,u1651,m108,MICHAEL,I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
56262,L319760,u1642,m108,BRODY,"You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?"
56263,L319498,u1642,m108,BRODY,I want him out of the ocean.
56264,L319497,u1651,m108,MICHAEL,"My boat's neat, dad!"
56265,L319496,u1642,m108,BRODY,Son! -- Out of the water now!
56266,L319351,u1642,m108,BRODY,On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
56267,L319350,u1651,m108,MICHAEL,Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
56268,L320050,u1642,m108,BRODY,He's taken him!
56269,L320049,u1652,m108,QUINT,He's comin' up -- !
56270,L320038,u1652,m108,QUINT,Full throttle! To port!
56271,L320037,u1642,m108,BRODY,He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
56272,L320036,u1652,m108,QUINT,Dead astern! Zig-zag!
56273,L320035,u1642,m108,BRODY,He's trying to sink us!
56274,L320031,u1652,m108,QUINT,No!
56275,L320030,u1642,m108,BRODY,Have you ever had one do this?
56276,L320029,u1652,m108,QUINT,He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
56277,L320024,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Have to pump her steady, s'all."
56278,L320023,u1642,m108,BRODY,What about us?
56279,L320005,u1652,m108,QUINT,No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
56280,L320004,u1642,m108,BRODY,Did you get him in the head?
56281,L319995,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call."
56282,L319994,u1652,m108,QUINT,Shut up! Just pump her out!
56283,L319993,u1642,m108,BRODY,That's it! Radio in for help!
56284,L319974,u1652,m108,QUINT,The bilge pumps. There --
56285,L319973,u1642,m108,BRODY,Where...?
56286,L319972,u1652,m108,QUINT,He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
56287,L319962,u1652,m108,QUINT,Tattoo. Had it taken off.
56288,L319961,u1642,m108,BRODY,"What's that one, there?"
56289,L319960,u1652,m108,QUINT,I almost had 'im.
56290,L319959,u1642,m108,BRODY,C'mon. Middle appendix --
56291,L319958,u1652,m108,QUINT,Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
56292,L319939,u1652,m108,QUINT,"You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark..."
56293,L319938,u1642,m108,BRODY,Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
56294,L319937,u1652,m108,QUINT,We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
56295,L319936,u1642,m108,BRODY,Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
56296,L319911,u1642,m108,BRODY,What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
56297,L319910,u1652,m108,QUINT,I never saw one that big.
56298,L319904,u1652,m108,QUINT,"What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?"
56299,L319903,u1642,m108,BRODY,How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
56300,L319902,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle."
56301,L319901,u1642,m108,BRODY,What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
56302,L319895,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --"
56303,L319894,u1642,m108,BRODY,The wire's showing!
56304,L319882,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!"
56305,L319881,u1642,m108,BRODY,You got it?
56306,L319877,u1652,m108,QUINT,...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
56307,L319876,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?"
56308,L319868,u1652,m108,QUINT,Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
56309,L319867,u1642,m108,BRODY,Who's driving the boat?
56310,L319866,u1652,m108,QUINT,Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
56311,L319833,u1642,m108,BRODY,You got it.
56312,L319832,u1652,m108,QUINT,"All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast."
56313,L319831,u1642,m108,BRODY,It's my charter. My party.
56314,L319830,u1652,m108,QUINT,What do you mean 'We...?'
56315,L319829,u1642,m108,BRODY,Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
56316,L319818,u1642,m108,BRODY,He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
56317,L319817,u1652,m108,QUINT,I know who he is...
56318,L319816,u1642,m108,BRODY,This is Matt Hooper...
56319,L319808,u1652,m108,QUINT,Try some of this. I made it myself.
56320,L319807,u1642,m108,BRODY,Two cases. And dinner when you land.
56321,L319806,u1652,m108,QUINT,"And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch."
56322,L319805,u1642,m108,BRODY,You got it.
56323,L319804,u1652,m108,QUINT,And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
56324,L319803,u1642,m108,BRODY,You got it.
56325,L319802,u1652,m108,QUINT,"And incidental damages, if any..."
56326,L319801,u1642,m108,BRODY,You got it.
56327,L319800,u1652,m108,QUINT,"And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not."
56328,L319799,u1642,m108,BRODY,"I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000."
56329,L319798,u1652,m108,QUINT,Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
56330,L319797,u1642,m108,BRODY,What?
56331,L319796,u1652,m108,QUINT,Did you bring a check?
56332,L319857,u1642,m108,BRODY,Tell 'em I went fishin'!
56333,L319856,u1646,m108,ELLEN,What'll I tell the kids?
56334,L319855,u1642,m108,BRODY,Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
56335,L319853,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit."
56336,L319852,u1642,m108,BRODY,Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
56337,L319851,u1646,m108,ELLEN,You going to be all right?
56338,L319850,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Colorful, isn't he?"
56339,L319781,u1642,m108,BRODY,No. Home here.
56340,L319780,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Home... New York?
56341,L319646,u1642,m108,BRODY,I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
56342,L319645,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Can you do that?
56343,L319644,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not."
56344,L319623,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Thank you.
56345,L319622,u1642,m108,BRODY,"You too, sweetheart..."
56346,L319617,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news."
56347,L319616,u1642,m108,BRODY,How come you have to tell them that?
56348,L319502,u1642,m108,BRODY,"I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself..."
56349,L319501,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again."
56350,L319500,u1642,m108,BRODY,Michael! Come inside!
56351,L319499,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"It's three feet deep, Martin"
56352,L319494,u1646,m108,ELLEN,He's sitting in it.
56353,L319493,u1642,m108,BRODY,Where is he?
56354,L319492,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Mikey loves his birthday present.
56355,L319491,u1642,m108,BRODY,Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
56356,L319490,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Can you stand something to eat?
56357,L319456,u1642,m108,BRODY,Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
56358,L319455,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"You're very tight, y'know?  Right there."
56359,L319366,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
56360,L319365,u1642,m108,BRODY,Love ya.
56361,L319364,u1642,m108,BRODY,Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
56362,L319363,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Be careful.
56363,L319358,u1642,m108,BRODY,"I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes."
56364,L319357,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"Older, sillier."
56365,L319356,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Sexy, hm? What was I before?"
56366,L319355,u1646,m108,ELLEN,I think they make you look sexy.
56367,L319354,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?"
56368,L319353,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Don't forget these.
56369,L319349,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
56370,L319348,u1642,m108,BRODY,I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
56371,L319347,u1646,m108,ELLEN,You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
56372,L319346,u1642,m108,BRODY,Feed the dogs.
56373,L319345,u1646,m108,ELLEN,I never hear the whistle.
56374,L319344,u1642,m108,BRODY,Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
56375,L319343,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Give me 30 years, I'll get it."
56376,L319342,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Like you're from N'Yawk.
56377,L319341,u1642,m108,BRODY,"The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?"
56378,L319340,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'"
56379,L319339,u1642,m108,BRODY,Probably out in the back yard.
56380,L319338,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Do you see the kids?
56381,L319337,u1642,m108,BRODY,Right.
56382,L319336,u1646,m108,ELLEN,'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
56383,L319335,u1642,m108,BRODY,How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
56384,L319792,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Just sign it, Larry."
56385,L319791,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,My kids were on that beach...
56386,L319790,u1642,m108,BRODY,The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
56387,L319789,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,I was acting in the town's best interests...
56388,L319788,u1642,m108,BRODY,Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
56389,L319787,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,Maybe we can save August...
56390,L319786,u1642,m108,BRODY,I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
56391,L319785,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,I don't know if I can do that without a...
56392,L319784,u1642,m108,BRODY,There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
56393,L319783,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,Why?
56394,L319782,u1642,m108,BRODY,Got a pen on you?
56395,L319716,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend."
56396,L319715,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August."
56397,L319714,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
56398,L319706,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
56399,L319705,u1642,m108,BRODY,"We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have."
56400,L319702,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,What kind of a shark did you say it was?
56401,L319701,u1642,m108,BRODY,He lost it on the way up.
56402,L319599,u1642,m108,BRODY,I'm going home.
56403,L319598,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"Let's all get out of here, this place stinks."
56404,L319597,u1642,m108,BRODY,She's right.
56405,L319588,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?"
56406,L319587,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way."
56407,L319579,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
56408,L319578,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute."
56409,L319577,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,Who's that young man?
56410,L319575,u1642,m108,BRODY,Sure he is.
56411,L319574,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
56412,L319573,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!"
56413,L319479,u1642,m108,BRODY,I didn't agree to that!
56414,L319478,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,Only 24 hours!
56415,L319475,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin."
56416,L319474,u1642,m108,BRODY,"I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland."
56417,L319432,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"Martin, we hired the best man we could find."
56418,L319431,u1642,m108,BRODY,I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
56419,L319429,u1642,m108,BRODY,I was only reacting to what I was told.
56420,L319428,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
56421,L319417,u1642,m108,BRODY,So we should set out a smorgasbord?
56422,L319416,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island."
56423,L319415,u1642,m108,BRODY,Now tell me something I don't know.
56424,L319412,u1642,m108,BRODY,Do I need any more authority?
56425,L319411,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
56426,L320058,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I can't imagine why.
56427,L320057,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Y'know, I used to hate the water..."
56428,L320056,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Just keep kicking.
56429,L320055,u1642,m108,BRODY,Think the tide's with us?
56430,L320054,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think."
56431,L320053,u1642,m108,BRODY,What day is this?
56432,L320052,u1642,m108,BRODY,No...  You think we can get back with those?
56433,L320051,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Quint...?
56434,L320012,u1642,m108,BRODY,I can't stand here doing nothing!
56435,L320011,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
56436,L319969,u1649,m108,HOOPER,It's a whale out there.
56437,L319968,u1642,m108,BRODY,What the hell?
56438,L319966,u1649,m108,HOOPER,You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
56439,L319965,u1642,m108,BRODY,"What's that, a ship?"
56440,L319794,u1649,m108,HOOPER,This is quite a place.
56441,L319793,u1642,m108,BRODY,This has got to be one big violation...
56442,L319726,u1642,m108,BRODY,I wish it would rain...
56443,L319725,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I hope we get some more help.
56444,L319713,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks."
56445,L319712,u1642,m108,BRODY,Wait a minute! I need you.
56446,L319708,u1642,m108,BRODY,That means closing the beaches.
56447,L319707,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply..."
56448,L319698,u1642,m108,BRODY,"We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up."
56449,L319697,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
56450,L319696,u1642,m108,BRODY,"A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!"
56451,L319695,u1649,m108,HOOPER,A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
56452,L319694,u1642,m108,BRODY,"There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island."
56453,L319693,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water."
56454,L319692,u1642,m108,BRODY,There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
56455,L319690,u1642,m108,BRODY,No shark did that to a boat!
56456,L319689,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate..."
56457,L319688,u1642,m108,BRODY,You all right?
56458,L319687,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Be careful, for chrissake."
56459,L319686,u1649,m108,HOOPER,We will. There's something I've got to find out.
56460,L319685,u1642,m108,BRODY,Why don't we just tow it in?
56461,L319684,u1649,m108,HOOPER,He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
56462,L319683,u1649,m108,HOOPER,They must've hit something.
56463,L319682,u1642,m108,BRODY,Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
56464,L319681,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I want to check something. Hold my feet.
56465,L319680,u1642,m108,BRODY,What happened?
56466,L319675,u1642,m108,BRODY,We gotta get back soon...
56467,L319674,u1649,m108,HOOPER,It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
56468,L319673,u1642,m108,BRODY,You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
56469,L319672,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal."
56470,L319671,u1642,m108,BRODY,Where'd you get all this?
56471,L319670,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us."
56472,L319669,u1642,m108,BRODY,Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
56473,L319668,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel."
56474,L319667,u1642,m108,BRODY,What is all this stuff?
56475,L319665,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders..."
56476,L319664,u1642,m108,BRODY,Chum?
56477,L319663,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him."
56478,L319662,u1642,m108,BRODY,What do we do?
56479,L319661,u1649,m108,HOOPER,...Nothing.
56480,L319660,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here..."
56481,L319659,u1642,m108,BRODY,He ate a car?
56482,L319658,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Florida license plate.
56483,L319657,u1642,m108,BRODY,How can you tell?
56484,L319656,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters."
56485,L319655,u1642,m108,BRODY,What? What?!
56486,L319654,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
56487,L319653,u1642,m108,BRODY,What's that?
56488,L319650,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Our friend, the shark."
56489,L319649,u1642,m108,BRODY,What stinks so bad?
56490,L319648,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence."
56491,L319643,u1649,m108,HOOPER,You could say that.
56492,L319642,u1642,m108,BRODY,"And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?"
56493,L319641,u1649,m108,HOOPER,It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
56494,L319640,u1642,m108,BRODY,Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
56495,L319639,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Rogue?
56496,L319638,u1642,m108,BRODY,"There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh..."
56497,L319637,u1649,m108,HOOPER,About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
56498,L319636,u1642,m108,BRODY,Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
56499,L319635,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
56500,L319634,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?"
56501,L319621,u1642,m108,BRODY,Let's all have a drink.
56502,L319620,u1649,m108,HOOPER,We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
56503,L319609,u1642,m108,BRODY,Swell.
56504,L319608,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Dynamite!  How was your day...?
56505,L319584,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside."
56506,L319583,u1642,m108,BRODY,What d'ya mean?
56507,L319582,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one..."
56508,L319569,u1642,m108,BRODY,You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
56509,L319568,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck."
56510,L319566,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark."
56511,L319565,u1642,m108,BRODY,"No, we just checked the beach..."
56512,L319564,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?"
56513,L319563,u1642,m108,BRODY,"No, it was local jurisdiction."
56514,L319562,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?"
56515,L319553,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute."
56516,L319552,u1642,m108,BRODY,Who are you?
56517,L319551,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?"
56518,L319550,u1642,m108,BRODY,"You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy."
56519,L319549,u1649,m108,HOOPER,There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
56520,L319381,u1642,m108,BRODY,Pretty stiff.
56521,L319380,u1643,m108,CASSIDY,"A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that."
56522,L319379,u1642,m108,BRODY,What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
56523,L319378,u1643,m108,CASSIDY,Some friends and me took a house.
56524,L319377,u1642,m108,BRODY,You here for the summer?
56525,L319376,u1643,m108,CASSIDY,"No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though."
56526,L319375,u1642,m108,BRODY,You from around here?
56527,L319374,u1643,m108,CASSIDY,"Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned."
56528,L319373,u1642,m108,BRODY,Think she might've run out on you?
56529,L319372,u1643,m108,CASSIDY,Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
56530,L319371,u1642,m108,BRODY,And nobody else saw her in the water?
56531,L319370,u1643,m108,CASSIDY,I didn't know her.
56532,L319369,u1642,m108,BRODY,You picked her up on the ferry.
56533,L319368,u1643,m108,CASSIDY,Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
56534,L319367,u1642,m108,BRODY,Christine what?
56535,L319526,u1642,m108,BRODY,Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
56536,L319525,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
56537,L319524,u1642,m108,BRODY,That wasn't funny.
56538,L319523,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,"...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat."
56539,L319402,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,What's the matter with my printing?
56540,L319401,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing."
56541,L319400,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,"Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there."
56542,L319393,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,We never had any. What's the problem?
56543,L319392,u1642,m108,BRODY,Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
56544,L319473,u1650,m108,MEADOWS,"What's going on with the beaches, Chief?"
56545,L319472,u1642,m108,BRODY,I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
56546,L319467,u1642,m108,BRODY,I'm responsible for public safety around here...
56547,L319466,u1650,m108,MEADOWS,"I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this."
56548,L319465,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering."
56549,L319425,u1642,m108,BRODY,"Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!"
56550,L319424,u1650,m108,MEADOWS,...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
56551,L319419,u1642,m108,BRODY,What else could've done that?
56552,L319418,u1650,m108,MEADOWS,We're not even sure what it was.
56553,L319519,u1644,m108,CHARLIE,Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
56554,L319518,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,Do I set the goddam hook?
56555,L319517,u1644,m108,CHARLIE,Look at him take it!
56556,L319515,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
56557,L319514,u1644,m108,CHARLIE,Twenty years.
56558,L319513,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,"You do this all the time, right, Charlie?"
56559,L319511,u1644,m108,CHARLIE,Set?
56560,L319510,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,"One more after this, then I'm going home."
56561,L319509,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
56562,L319508,u1644,m108,CHARLIE,Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
56563,L319507,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,Leg of lamb this time?
56564,L319506,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,"Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back."
56565,L319505,u1644,m108,CHARLIE,"It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?"
56566,L319504,u1645,m108,DENHERDER,You wanna call it a night after here?
56567,L319633,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it."
56568,L319632,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Yep.
56569,L319631,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?"
56570,L319630,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding..."
56571,L319629,u1646,m108,ELLEN,"Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them."
56572,L319628,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
56573,L319627,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Is that a boat?
56574,L319626,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Going out on the 'Aurora.'
56575,L319625,u1646,m108,ELLEN,You're leaving?
56576,L319624,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one."
56577,L319615,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere."
56578,L319614,u1646,m108,ELLEN,You love sharks?
56579,L319613,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
56580,L319612,u1646,m108,ELLEN,My husband tells me you're in sharks.
56581,L319607,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Is anyone having this...?
56582,L319606,u1646,m108,ELLEN,Would you like something? Some coffee?
56583,L319605,u1646,m108,ELLEN,So would I. Come on in.
56584,L319604,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him."
56585,L319923,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out."
56586,L319922,u1647,m108,ELLEN'S VOICE,Well... is everything all right?
56587,L319921,u1652,m108,QUINT,He's busy.
56588,L319920,u1647,m108,ELLEN'S VOICE,I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
56589,L319919,u1652,m108,QUINT,"This is Quint, Missus."
56590,L319918,u1647,m108,ELLEN'S VOICE,"...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?"
56591,L319409,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say."
56592,L319408,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,I've got all these signs here...
56593,L319407,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny."
56594,L319406,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,"I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off."
56595,L319405,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"Who've you told this to, Lenny?"
56596,L319404,u1648,m108,HENDRICKS,"We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach."
56597,L319403,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"What have you got there, Lenny?"
56598,L320043,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
56599,L320042,u1652,m108,QUINT,What can that gun of yours do?
56600,L320033,u1649,m108,HOOPER,He's under!
56601,L320032,u1652,m108,QUINT,Follow him!
56602,L320027,u1652,m108,QUINT,No way! He can't!
56603,L320026,u1649,m108,HOOPER,He's heading under -- !
56604,L320001,u1652,m108,QUINT,"No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---"
56605,L320000,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Coming right to us!
56606,L319992,u1649,m108,HOOPER,The shaft is giving.
56607,L319991,u1652,m108,QUINT,Easy! It'll tear right out!
56608,L319964,u1652,m108,QUINT,'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
56609,L319963,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
56610,L319954,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"I think I can top that, Mister..."
56611,L319953,u1652,m108,QUINT,...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
56612,L319951,u1652,m108,QUINT,And I'll drink to yours.
56613,L319950,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I'll drink to your leg.
56614,L319948,u1652,m108,QUINT,Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
56615,L319947,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
56616,L319946,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Ever see one like this?
56617,L319945,u1652,m108,QUINT,Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
56618,L319944,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
56619,L319943,u1652,m108,QUINT,Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
56620,L319909,u1652,m108,QUINT,25 feet. And three tons of him there.
56621,L319908,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"20 feet, if it's an inch..."
56622,L319907,u1652,m108,QUINT,At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
56623,L319906,u1649,m108,HOOPER,What do you see?
56624,L319905,u1652,m108,QUINT,Over there!
56625,L319900,u1652,m108,QUINT,Fasten the pole.
56626,L319899,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I'm okay...
56627,L319898,u1652,m108,QUINT,"A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge."
56628,L319893,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!"
56629,L319892,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark."
56630,L319891,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Down here, Hooper!"
56631,L319890,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Let it go, don't waste your time."
56632,L319889,u1652,m108,QUINT,Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
56633,L319885,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy."
56634,L319884,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there..."
56635,L319875,u1652,m108,QUINT,It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation.
56636,L319874,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"That's pilot whale, isn't it?"
56637,L319873,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me."
56638,L319872,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?"
56639,L319870,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing..."
56640,L319869,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing."
56641,L319865,u1652,m108,QUINT,Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
56642,L319864,u1649,m108,HOOPER,What's that supposed to prove?
56643,L319844,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Who's inside, you or the shark?"
56644,L319843,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Anti-Shark cage.
56645,L319842,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?"
56646,L319841,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
56647,L319840,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait."
56648,L319828,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks..."
56649,L319827,u1652,m108,QUINT,"Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means."
56650,L319826,u1652,m108,QUINT,Let me see your hands...
56651,L319825,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
56652,L319824,u1652,m108,QUINT,Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
56653,L319823,u1649,m108,HOOPER,And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
56654,L319822,u1652,m108,QUINT,I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
56655,L319821,u1649,m108,HOOPER,-- and an America's Cup Trials...
56656,L319820,u1652,m108,QUINT,Transplants?
56657,L319819,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
56658,L319711,u1649,m108,HOOPER,That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
56659,L319710,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!"
56660,L319704,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished."
56661,L319703,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
56662,L319700,u1649,m108,HOOPER,I don't have it.
56663,L319699,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
56664,L319596,u1649,m108,HOOPER,"Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure..."
56665,L319595,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state."
56666,L319586,u1649,m108,HOOPER,Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
56667,L319585,u1653,m108,VAUGHN,"That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!"
56668,L329478,u1655,m109,BLEEKER'S MOM,I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
56669,L329477,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,You've mentioned it about fifty times.
56670,L329476,u1655,m109,BLEEKER'S MOM,You know how I feel about her.
56671,L329475,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Thanks for the message.
56672,L329474,u1655,m109,BLEEKER'S MOM,Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
56673,L329473,u1655,m109,BLEEKER'S MOM,"But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it."
56674,L329472,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"I'm not hungry, oddly."
56675,L329471,u1655,m109,BLEEKER'S MOM,"You ran eight miles today, Puppy."
56676,L329470,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I don't think so.
56677,L329469,u1655,m109,BLEEKER'S MOM,Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
56678,L330146,u1660,m109,JUNO,"The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."
56679,L330145,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."
56680,L330144,u1660,m109,JUNO,"You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."
56681,L330143,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."
56682,L330142,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."
56683,L330141,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."
56684,L330107,u1660,m109,JUNO,Okay.
56685,L330106,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Can we make out now?
56686,L330105,u1660,m109,JUNO,"That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude."
56687,L330104,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil."
56688,L330103,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend."
56689,L330102,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Mine too.
56690,L330101,u1660,m109,JUNO,I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
56691,L330100,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Wizard!
56692,L330099,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,It does?
56693,L330098,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard."
56694,L330097,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time."
56695,L330096,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, ""Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard""? And it said, ""I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here""? That was hilarious."
56696,L330095,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"I try really hard, actually..."
56697,L330094,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try."
56698,L330093,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"What, you mean as friends?"
56699,L330092,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Also, I think I'm in love with you."
56700,L330091,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,You know it's okay.
56701,L330090,u1660,m109,JUNO,"You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you."
56702,L330089,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
56703,L330088,u1660,m109,JUNO,Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
56704,L330087,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Why?
56705,L330086,u1660,m109,JUNO,Yeah. That was me.
56706,L330085,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
56707,L329963,u1660,m109,JUNO,Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
56708,L329962,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
56709,L329961,u1660,m109,JUNO,Huh?
56710,L329960,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Wait, let me take that."
56711,L329959,u1660,m109,JUNO,Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
56712,L329958,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,No...
56713,L329957,u1660,m109,JUNO,What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
56714,L329956,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Oh my God, SHUT UP!"
56715,L329955,u1660,m109,JUNO,I still have your virginity!
56716,L329954,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Yeah, well... I still have your underwear."
56717,L329953,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!"
56718,L329952,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, ""Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."""
56719,L329951,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?"
56720,L329950,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore."
56721,L329949,u1660,m109,JUNO,"That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?"
56722,L329948,u1660,m109,JUNO,What?
56723,L329947,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,You're being really immature.
56724,L329945,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
56725,L329944,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday..."
56726,L329943,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,You're mad. Why are you mad?
56727,L329942,u1660,m109,JUNO,Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
56728,L329941,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,We're getting a stretch limo.
56729,L329940,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin."
56730,L329939,u1660,m109,JUNO,Leah just told me you were going with her.
56731,L329938,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Um, hi?"
56732,L329937,u1660,m109,JUNO,Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
56733,L329847,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
56734,L329846,u1660,m109,JUNO,I totally heard you did.
56735,L329845,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I don't like Katrina.
56736,L329844,u1660,m109,JUNO,What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
56737,L329843,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Well, we were once. You know, that time."
56738,L329842,u1660,m109,JUNO,Were we together?
56739,L329841,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,We could get back together too.
56740,L329840,u1660,m109,JUNO,Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
56741,L329839,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again."
56742,L329838,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Well, I do."
56743,L329837,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Jesus, Bleek."
56744,L329836,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
56745,L329835,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
56746,L329834,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Oh. That's a relief.
56747,L329833,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe."
56748,L329832,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Is that normal?
56749,L329831,u1660,m109,JUNO,The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
56750,L329830,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Really? What are they like?
56751,L329829,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents."
56752,L329828,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days."
56753,L329826,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I miss it too.
56754,L329825,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights."
56755,L329824,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,What's up?
56756,L329668,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'll try to drop by later.
56757,L329667,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Okay, cool."
56758,L329666,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything."
56759,L329665,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
56760,L329385,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Or something.
56761,L329384,u1660,m109,JUNO,Charisma?
56762,L329383,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
56763,L329382,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?"
56764,L329381,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,But you copy my work every week.
56765,L329380,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Oh, I couldn't copy your work."
56766,L329379,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
56767,L329378,u1660,m109,JUNO,Well! Nothing like experimenting.
56768,L329368,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I'll see you at school, O.K.?"
56769,L329367,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Whose idea was it?
56770,L329366,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
56771,L329365,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right."
56772,L329364,u1660,m109,JUNO,"So that's cool with you, then?"
56773,L329363,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant."
56774,L329362,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant."
56775,L329361,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"So, what do you think we should do?"
56776,L329360,u1660,m109,JUNO,I know.
56777,L329359,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I'm supposed to be running.
56778,L329358,u1660,m109,JUNO,"When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time."
56779,L329356,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm pregnant.
56780,L329355,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I don't know...
56781,L329354,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Go Carole.  So, guess what?"
56782,L329353,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,My mom uses color-safe bleach.
56783,L329352,u1660,m109,JUNO,Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
56784,L329351,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Cool.
56785,L329350,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick."
56786,L329349,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud."
56787,L329348,u1660,m109,JUNO,Hey Bleek.
56788,L329664,u1669,m109,VIJAY,Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
56789,L329663,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
56790,L329662,u1669,m109,VIJAY,You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
56791,L329661,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,I don't really know anything about it.
56792,L329660,u1669,m109,VIJAY,"What a trip, man."
56793,L329659,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Yup.
56794,L329658,u1669,m109,VIJAY,Did you hear it's yours?
56795,L329657,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Yup.
56796,L329656,u1669,m109,VIJAY,Just like our moms and teachers!
56797,L329655,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,Yup.
56798,L329654,u1669,m109,VIJAY,Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
56799,L329653,u1654,m109,BLEEKER,"Oh, hey Vijay."
56800,L329652,u1669,m109,VIJAY,Hey man.
56801,L329699,u1656,m109,BREN,You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
56802,L329698,u1667,m109,ULTRASOUND TECH,What are you talking about?
56803,L329697,u1656,m109,BREN,"Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know."
56804,L329696,u1667,m109,ULTRASOUND TECH,"I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am."
56805,L329695,u1656,m109,BREN,"I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?"
56806,L329694,u1667,m109,ULTRASOUND TECH,Excuse me?
56807,L329693,u1656,m109,BREN,"What is your job title, exactly?"
56808,L329692,u1667,m109,ULTRASOUND TECH,No... I guess not.
56809,L329691,u1656,m109,BREN,They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
56810,L329688,u1667,m109,ULTRASOUND TECH,I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
56811,L329687,u1656,m109,BREN,"Wait, what's that supposed to mean?"
56812,L329679,u1667,m109,ULTRASOUND TECH,"Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?"
56813,L329678,u1656,m109,BREN,What? I'm not made of stone.
56814,L329532,u1656,m109,BREN,"Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea."
56815,L329531,u1662,m109,MAC,That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
56816,L329530,u1656,m109,BREN,Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
56817,L329529,u1662,m109,MAC,Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
56818,L329528,u1656,m109,BREN,You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
56819,L329527,u1662,m109,MAC,I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
56820,L329526,u1656,m109,BREN,I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
56821,L329525,u1662,m109,MAC,"Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?"
56822,L329497,u1662,m109,MAC,"No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?"
56823,L329496,u1656,m109,BREN,Nails? Really?
56824,L330119,u1660,m109,JUNO,It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
56825,L330118,u1656,m109,BREN,"Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?"
56826,L330117,u1656,m109,BREN,"Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream."
56827,L330116,u1660,m109,JUNO,You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
56828,L330115,u1656,m109,BREN,"It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough."
56829,L330114,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?"
56830,L329817,u1656,m109,BREN,"Oh, go fly a kite."
56831,L329816,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Wow, dream big!"
56832,L329815,u1656,m109,BREN,"Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners."
56833,L329814,u1660,m109,JUNO,We don't even have a dog!
56834,L329813,u1656,m109,BREN,I know enough.
56835,L329812,u1660,m109,JUNO,You don't know anything about me!
56836,L329811,u1656,m109,BREN,"It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage."
56837,L329810,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married."
56838,L329809,u1656,m109,BREN,"That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary."
56839,L329808,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool."
56840,L329807,u1656,m109,BREN,"You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?"
56841,L329806,u1660,m109,JUNO,"They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!"
56842,L329805,u1656,m109,BREN,A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
56843,L329804,u1660,m109,JUNO,I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
56844,L329803,u1656,m109,BREN,"Where the hell have you been, Junebug?"
56845,L329518,u1660,m109,JUNO,"The term ""deliver"" is so weird. Can we not say ""deliver""?"
56846,L329517,u1656,m109,BREN,"First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver."
56847,L329516,u1660,m109,JUNO,Cool it.
56848,L329515,u1656,m109,BREN,"Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!"
56849,L329514,u1660,m109,JUNO,No.
56850,L329510,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Well, I'm not ready to be a mom."
56851,L329509,u1656,m109,BREN,"Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now."
56852,L329508,u1660,m109,JUNO,But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
56853,L329489,u1660,m109,JUNO,But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
56854,L329488,u1656,m109,BREN,"Oh, God..."
56855,L329482,u1656,m109,BREN,"Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible."
56856,L329481,u1660,m109,JUNO,No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
56857,L329480,u1656,m109,BREN,"Hon, did you get expelled?"
56858,L329479,u1660,m109,JUNO,I have no idea how to spit this out.
56859,L329417,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it."
56860,L329416,u1656,m109,BREN,"Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning."
56861,L329573,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Shit, yeah. Close it up."
56862,L329572,u1657,m109,GERTA,"Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?"
56863,L329571,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid."
56864,L329557,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks."
56865,L329556,u1657,m109,GERTA,"No, I mean in your pregnancy."
56866,L329555,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm a junior.
56867,L329554,u1657,m109,GERTA,"So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?"
56868,L329398,u1659,m109,GUY LAB PARTNER,"Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it."
56869,L329397,u1658,m109,GIRL LAB PARTNER,Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
56870,L329396,u1659,m109,GUY LAB PARTNER,Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
56871,L329393,u1658,m109,GIRL LAB PARTNER,"Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes."
56872,L329392,u1659,m109,GUY LAB PARTNER,What? My eyes are not lying!
56873,L329391,u1658,m109,GIRL LAB PARTNER,"Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes."
56874,L329390,u1659,m109,GUY LAB PARTNER,"You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!"
56875,L329389,u1658,m109,GIRL LAB PARTNER,"No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man."
56876,L329388,u1659,m109,GUY LAB PARTNER,"Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen."
56877,L330015,u1660,m109,JUNO,Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
56878,L330014,u1663,m109,MARK,"God, you're so young."
56879,L330013,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife."
56880,L330011,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying."
56881,L330010,u1663,m109,MARK,That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
56882,L330009,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?"
56883,L330008,u1663,m109,MARK,This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
56884,L330007,u1660,m109,JUNO,I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
56885,L330006,u1663,m109,MARK,"I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?"
56886,L330005,u1660,m109,JUNO,But you're old!
56887,L330004,u1663,m109,MARK,"A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father."
56888,L330003,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!"
56889,L330002,u1663,m109,MARK,But I thought you'd be cool if...
56890,L330001,u1660,m109,JUNO,This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
56891,L330000,u1663,m109,MARK,What's the matter?
56892,L329999,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!"
56893,L329998,u1663,m109,MARK,No?
56894,L329997,u1660,m109,JUNO,No.
56895,L329996,u1663,m109,MARK,"It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time..."
56896,L329995,u1660,m109,JUNO,What?
56897,L329994,u1663,m109,MARK,I'm leaving Vanessa.
56898,L329992,u1660,m109,JUNO,I don't know.
56899,L329991,u1663,m109,MARK,What are you?
56900,L329990,u1660,m109,JUNO,Only squares and nerds go to dances.
56901,L329989,u1663,m109,MARK,"You've never been to a dance, have you?"
56902,L329988,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Oh, okay. Like this."
56903,L329986,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!"
56904,L329985,u1663,m109,MARK,Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
56905,L329984,u1660,m109,JUNO,"That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?"
56906,L329983,u1663,m109,MARK,"Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom."
56907,L329982,u1660,m109,JUNO,You do?
56908,L329981,u1663,m109,MARK,I actually know this one.
56909,L329980,u1660,m109,JUNO,What?
56910,L329977,u1663,m109,MARK,"Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition."
56911,L329976,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now."
56912,L329975,u1663,m109,MARK,Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
56913,L329974,u1660,m109,JUNO,"""Most Fruitful Yuki""? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!"
56914,L329972,u1663,m109,MARK,"You're gonna like this, I promise."
56915,L329971,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Oh God, you're one of those guys..."
56916,L329970,u1663,m109,MARK,"Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them."
56917,L329969,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!"
56918,L329968,u1663,m109,MARK,"Come on, I have something for you."
56919,L329967,u1660,m109,JUNO,Cool.
56920,L329966,u1663,m109,MARK,Nope. We're safe.
56921,L329965,u1660,m109,JUNO,Is Vanessa here?
56922,L329964,u1663,m109,MARK,Wow. That shirt is working hard.
56923,L329912,u1663,m109,MARK,Go learn something.
56924,L329911,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi."
56925,L329910,u1663,m109,MARK,I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
56926,L329909,u1660,m109,JUNO,Consider it your musical education.
56927,L329908,u1663,m109,MARK,I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
56928,L329907,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison."
56929,L329906,u1663,m109,MARK,Cute?
56930,L329905,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute."
56931,L329904,u1663,m109,MARK,Oh really? What's the verdict?
56932,L329903,u1660,m109,JUNO,"So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me."
56933,L329902,u1663,m109,MARK,Hello?
56934,L329799,u1660,m109,JUNO,You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
56935,L329798,u1663,m109,MARK,Cold feet.
56936,L329794,u1660,m109,JUNO,Why?
56937,L329793,u1663,m109,MARK,I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
56938,L329790,u1663,m109,MARK,"Yeah. Mall madness, huh?"
56939,L329789,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Hey, what kind of swag did you score?"
56940,L329786,u1660,m109,JUNO,I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
56941,L329785,u1663,m109,MARK,Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
56942,L329770,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
56943,L329769,u1663,m109,MARK,Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
56944,L329768,u1660,m109,JUNO,Why? What the big deal?
56945,L329767,u1663,m109,MARK,"Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here."
56946,L329766,u1663,m109,MARK,You're something else.
56947,L329765,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys."
56948,L329764,u1663,m109,MARK,"You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this."
56949,L329763,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Uh, thanks."
56950,L329762,u1663,m109,MARK,That suits you.
56951,L329761,u1660,m109,JUNO,"My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross."
56952,L329760,u1663,m109,MARK,"God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?"
56953,L329759,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?"
56954,L329758,u1663,m109,MARK,"Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl."
56955,L329757,u1660,m109,JUNO,"So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?"
56956,L329756,u1663,m109,MARK,Here's to dovetailing interests.
56957,L329755,u1660,m109,JUNO,"This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark."
56958,L329754,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Frankly, this looks kind of stupid."
56959,L329753,u1663,m109,MARK,"Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang."
56960,L329752,u1660,m109,JUNO,Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
56961,L329751,u1663,m109,MARK,Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
56962,L329750,u1660,m109,JUNO,The Wizard of Gore?
56963,L329749,u1663,m109,MARK,"Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there."
56964,L329748,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways."
56965,L329747,u1663,m109,MARK,It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
56966,L329746,u1660,m109,JUNO,You don't have to do that.
56967,L329745,u1663,m109,MARK,This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
56968,L329744,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Hey, I like this."
56969,L329743,u1663,m109,MARK,"Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby..."
56970,L329742,u1663,m109,MARK,You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
56971,L329741,u1660,m109,JUNO,I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
56972,L329740,u1663,m109,MARK,"It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing ""Superstar"" by the Carpenters."
56973,L329739,u1660,m109,JUNO,What is it?
56974,L329737,u1660,m109,JUNO,Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
56975,L329736,u1663,m109,MARK,We definitely want it to have junk.
56976,L329735,u1660,m109,JUNO,Yeah?
56977,L329734,u1663,m109,MARK,I know what junk is.
56978,L329733,u1660,m109,JUNO,You know... it's parts...
56979,L329732,u1663,m109,MARK,Junk?
56980,L329731,u1660,m109,JUNO,That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
56981,L329730,u1663,m109,MARK,"Well, it can really only go two ways."
56982,L329729,u1660,m109,JUNO,"The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise."
56983,L329728,u1663,m109,MARK,Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
56984,L329727,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No, he's the dad."
56985,L329726,u1663,m109,MARK,"Oh, is he bald and amorphous?"
56986,L329725,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie."
56987,L329724,u1663,m109,MARK,You're kidding!
56988,L329723,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child."
56989,L329720,u1663,m109,MARK,They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
56990,L329719,u1660,m109,JUNO,"You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?"
56991,L329718,u1663,m109,MARK,I wrote that.
56992,L329717,u1660,m109,JUNO,Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
56993,L329716,u1663,m109,MARK,Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
56994,L329715,u1660,m109,JUNO,Oh.
56995,L329714,u1663,m109,MARK,Commercials.
56996,L329713,u1660,m109,JUNO,Like what?
56997,L329712,u1663,m109,MARK,"No, more commercial stuff."
56998,L329711,u1660,m109,JUNO,No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
56999,L329710,u1663,m109,MARK,I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
57000,L329709,u1660,m109,JUNO,Why aren't you at work?
57001,L329708,u1663,m109,MARK,I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
57002,L329707,u1660,m109,JUNO,Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
57003,L329706,u1663,m109,MARK,Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
57004,L329705,u1660,m109,JUNO,Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
57005,L329704,u1663,m109,MARK,"No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know..."
57006,L329703,u1660,m109,JUNO,I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
57007,L329702,u1663,m109,MARK,"Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here."
57008,L329636,u1660,m109,JUNO,"That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio."
57009,L329635,u1663,m109,MARK,Yeah.
57010,L329634,u1660,m109,JUNO,Your guitar is named Kimber?
57011,L329621,u1663,m109,MARK,You weren't even alive!
57012,L329620,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic."
57013,L329619,u1663,m109,MARK,'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
57014,L329618,u1660,m109,JUNO,"When was this, like '96?"
57015,L329617,u1663,m109,MARK,"Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed."
57016,L329616,u1660,m109,JUNO,Yeah.
57017,L329615,u1663,m109,MARK,"Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?"
57018,L329614,u1660,m109,JUNO,"What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?"
57019,L329613,u1663,m109,MARK,Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
57020,L329612,u1660,m109,JUNO,What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
57021,L329611,u1663,m109,MARK,Oh.
57022,L329610,u1660,m109,JUNO,I rock a Harmony.
57023,L329609,u1663,m109,MARK,What do you play?
57024,L329608,u1660,m109,JUNO,It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
57025,L329607,u1663,m109,MARK,Shut up.
57026,L329606,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark."
57027,L329605,u1663,m109,MARK,"Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff."
57028,L329603,u1663,m109,MARK,We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
57029,L329602,u1660,m109,JUNO,Blood and guts.
57030,L329601,u1663,m109,MARK,Viscera?
57031,L329600,u1660,m109,JUNO,"You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in..."
57032,L329599,u1663,m109,MARK,Am I supposed to feel happy now?
57033,L329597,u1660,m109,JUNO,I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
57034,L329596,u1663,m109,MARK,I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
57035,L329595,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know."
57036,L329594,u1663,m109,MARK,What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
57037,L329593,u1660,m109,JUNO,Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
57038,L329592,u1663,m109,MARK,Sorry. I was just getting something.
57039,L329591,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here."
57040,L329570,u1663,m109,MARK,"Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament."
57041,L329569,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds."
57042,L329565,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?"
57043,L329564,u1663,m109,MARK,"So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing."
57044,L329548,u1663,m109,MARK,"Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit."
57045,L329547,u1660,m109,JUNO,No.
57046,L329543,u1660,m109,JUNO,Geeeerta Rauuuss!
57047,L329542,u1663,m109,MARK,"This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss."
57048,L329430,u1660,m109,JUNO,Really? Fingernails?
57049,L329429,u1666,m109,SU-CHIN,"Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails."
57050,L329428,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Well, it was nice seeing you."
57051,L329427,u1666,m109,SU-CHIN,I heard that was you.
57052,L329426,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, ""Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"""
57053,L329425,u1666,m109,SU-CHIN,No thanks. I'm off pills.
57054,L329424,u1660,m109,JUNO,You should try Adderall.
57055,L329423,u1666,m109,SU-CHIN,"No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating."
57056,L329422,u1660,m109,JUNO,Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
57057,L329421,u1666,m109,SU-CHIN,"Oh, hi Juno. How are you?"
57058,L329420,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Uh, hi Su-Chin."
57059,L330020,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
57060,L330019,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Mark? Why is Juno crying?
57061,L330018,u1660,m109,JUNO,Nothing.
57062,L330017,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Juno? What's going on?
57063,L329900,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Wow! It's magical.
57064,L329899,u1660,m109,JUNO,Elbow.
57065,L329898,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
57066,L329892,u1660,m109,JUNO,Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
57067,L329891,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?"
57068,L329887,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!"
57069,L329886,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?"
57070,L329885,u1660,m109,JUNO,Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
57071,L329884,u1668,m109,VANESSA,No...
57072,L329882,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends."
57073,L329881,u1660,m109,JUNO,Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
57074,L329801,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again."
57075,L329800,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home."
57076,L329797,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out."
57077,L329796,u1660,m109,JUNO,What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
57078,L329795,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone."
57079,L329792,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous."
57080,L329791,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right."
57081,L329784,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does."
57082,L329783,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying ""Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"""
57083,L329782,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Oh my God...
57084,L329781,u1660,m109,JUNO,This is the baby. Your baby.
57085,L329780,u1668,m109,VANESSA,What...
57086,L329779,u1660,m109,JUNO,Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
57087,L329778,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Is the baby okay?
57088,L329777,u1660,m109,JUNO,I went to the doctor today.
57089,L329776,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Then what's going on?
57090,L329775,u1660,m109,JUNO,Nothing...
57091,L329774,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?"
57092,L329647,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?"
57093,L329646,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Oh really?
57094,L329645,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
57095,L329642,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?"
57096,L329641,u1660,m109,JUNO,Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
57097,L329590,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Room with a toilet, got it."
57098,L329589,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right..."
57099,L329588,u1660,m109,JUNO,Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
57100,L329587,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents."
57101,L329563,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Well, you're lucky it's not you."
57102,L329562,u1668,m109,VANESSA,I think pregnancy is beautiful.
57103,L329561,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front."
57104,L329560,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest."
57105,L329559,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4."
57106,L329558,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?"
57107,L329550,u1660,m109,JUNO,"A Maker's Mark, please. Up."
57108,L329549,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water..."
57109,L329540,u1668,m109,VANESSA,You found us in the Penny Saver?
57110,L329539,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?"
57111,L329538,u1660,m109,JUNO,Sure.
57112,L329537,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Can I take your coats?
57113,L329534,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Vanessa, right?"
57114,L329533,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
57115,L329440,u1660,m109,JUNO,Congrats.
57116,L329439,u1664,m109,PUNK RECEPTIONIST,My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
57117,L329438,u1660,m109,JUNO,No thank you. I'm off sex.
57118,L329437,u1664,m109,PUNK RECEPTIONIST,Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
57119,L329434,u1660,m109,JUNO,Juno MacGuff.
57120,L329433,u1664,m109,PUNK RECEPTIONIST,"Your name, please?"
57121,L329432,u1660,m109,JUNO,Hi. I'm here for the big show?
57122,L330113,u1660,m109,JUNO,Thundercats are go!
57123,L330112,u1662,m109,MAC,Or...
57124,L330111,u1660,m109,JUNO,Either I just pissed my pants or...
57125,L330110,u1662,m109,MAC,What?!
57126,L330081,u1662,m109,MAC,"Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in."
57127,L330080,u1660,m109,JUNO,I sort of already have.
57128,L330078,u1662,m109,MAC,"It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy."
57129,L330077,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years."
57130,L330076,u1662,m109,MAC,Tore up from the floor up?
57131,L330075,u1660,m109,JUNO,Please stop now.
57132,L330074,u1662,m109,MAC,"Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?"
57133,L330073,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Dad, no!"
57134,L330072,u1662,m109,MAC,"Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up."
57135,L330071,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, like people in love."
57136,L330070,u1662,m109,MAC,You mean like couples?
57137,L330069,u1660,m109,JUNO,I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
57138,L330068,u1662,m109,MAC,Think you can narrow it down for me.
57139,L330067,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm losing my faith in humanity.
57140,L330066,u1662,m109,MAC,"You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?"
57141,L330065,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, she does."
57142,L330064,u1662,m109,MAC,"No, but you know Bren. She dreams big."
57143,L330063,u1660,m109,JUNO,Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
57144,L330062,u1662,m109,MAC,Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
57145,L330061,u1660,m109,JUNO,Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
57146,L330060,u1662,m109,MAC,"Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?"
57147,L330059,u1660,m109,JUNO,Hi Dad.
57148,L329577,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped."
57149,L329576,u1662,m109,MAC,Excuse me?
57150,L329552,u1660,m109,JUNO,I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
57151,L329551,u1662,m109,MAC,"She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts."
57152,L329523,u1660,m109,JUNO,I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
57153,L329522,u1662,m109,MAC,I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
57154,L329512,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!"
57155,L329511,u1662,m109,MAC,"Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds."
57156,L329506,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years."
57157,L329505,u1662,m109,MAC,Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
57158,L329504,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair."
57159,L329503,u1662,m109,MAC,"Okay, this is no laughing matter."
57160,L329500,u1662,m109,MAC,Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
57161,L329499,u1660,m109,JUNO,What?
57162,L329495,u1660,m109,JUNO,"The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly."
57163,L329494,u1662,m109,MAC,Who is the kid?
57164,L329492,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!"
57165,L329491,u1662,m109,MAC,You're pregnant?
57166,L329490,u1660,m109,JUNO,"They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened."
57167,L329485,u1662,m109,MAC,"What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?"
57168,L329484,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me."
57169,L329483,u1662,m109,MAC,Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
57170,L329415,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?"
57171,L329414,u1662,m109,MAC,"So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?"
57172,L329407,u1660,m109,JUNO,"My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona..."
57173,L329406,u1662,m109,MAC,You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
57174,L329318,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy."
57175,L329317,u1665,m109,ROLLO,"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?"
57176,L329315,u1665,m109,ROLLO,"Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights."
57177,L329314,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Jesus, I didn't say it was."
57178,L329313,u1665,m109,ROLLO,"Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!"
57179,L329312,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto."
57180,L329311,u1665,m109,ROLLO,Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
57181,L329306,u1660,m109,JUNO,I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
57182,L329305,u1665,m109,ROLLO,"Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?"
57183,L329936,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore."
57184,L329935,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Okay Juno, I'm really convinced."
57185,L329934,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all."
57186,L329933,u1661,m109,LEAH,Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
57187,L329932,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends."
57188,L329931,u1661,m109,LEAH,I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
57189,L329930,u1660,m109,JUNO,There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
57190,L329929,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie."
57191,L329928,u1660,m109,JUNO,Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
57192,L329927,u1661,m109,LEAH,"He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin."
57193,L329926,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date."
57194,L329925,u1661,m109,LEAH,Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
57195,L329924,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Eww, he's all beardy!"
57196,L329923,u1661,m109,LEAH,Keith's hot.
57197,L329922,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as ""Keith,"" okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days."
57198,L329921,u1661,m109,LEAH,I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
57199,L329920,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!"
57200,L329919,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Well, you are kind of... convex."
57201,L329918,u1660,m109,JUNO,"God, why is everyone always staring at me?"
57202,L329917,u1661,m109,LEAH,Hot!
57203,L329916,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode."
57204,L329915,u1661,m109,LEAH,I wish my funbags would get bigger.
57205,L329914,u1660,m109,JUNO,Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
57206,L329913,u1661,m109,LEAH,"God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?"
57207,L329879,u1661,m109,LEAH,"God, Spermy. Must you always feed?"
57208,L329878,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously."
57209,L329876,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Right, seriously."
57210,L329875,u1661,m109,LEAH,She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
57211,L329871,u1661,m109,LEAH,I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
57212,L329870,u1660,m109,JUNO,You sound shocked or something.
57213,L329869,u1661,m109,LEAH,No way! She's pretty.
57214,L329868,u1661,m109,LEAH,Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
57215,L329867,u1660,m109,JUNO,That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
57216,L329866,u1661,m109,LEAH,What?
57217,L329865,u1660,m109,JUNO,Hly shht!
57218,L329863,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Share the love, Tits!"
57219,L329862,u1661,m109,LEAH,Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
57220,L329690,u1661,m109,LEAH,Or stage parents!
57221,L329689,u1660,m109,JUNO,"How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?"
57222,L329681,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No way. No, I definitely don't want to know."
57223,L329680,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Aw, please Junebug?"
57224,L329677,u1660,m109,JUNO,It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
57225,L329676,u1661,m109,LEAH,Touche.
57226,L329675,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!"
57227,L329674,u1661,m109,LEAH,Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
57228,L329487,u1660,m109,JUNO,I'm pregnant.
57229,L329486,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed."
57230,L329466,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one."
57231,L329465,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!"
57232,L329464,u1661,m109,LEAH,"All right, how about this one? ""Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."""
57233,L329463,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular."
57234,L329462,u1661,m109,LEAH,"What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?"
57235,L329461,u1660,m109,JUNO,"No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as ""wholesome."" I'm looking for something a little edgier."
57236,L329460,u1661,m109,LEAH,You're not listening to me.
57237,L329459,u1660,m109,JUNO,There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
57238,L329458,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Look at this one ""Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other.""  ""All that's missing is your bastard."""
57239,L329457,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Yeah, but it sucks for free."
57240,L329456,u1660,m109,JUNO,The Penny Saver sucks.
57241,L329455,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch."
57242,L329454,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Oh yeah! ""Desperately Seeking Spawn."" They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit."
57243,L329453,u1660,m109,JUNO,There are ads? For parents?
57244,L329452,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver."
57245,L329451,u1660,m109,JUNO,Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
57246,L329450,u1661,m109,LEAH,Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
57247,L329449,u1660,m109,JUNO,I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
57248,L329448,u1661,m109,LEAH,But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
57249,L329447,u1660,m109,JUNO,"What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos."
57250,L329446,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active."
57251,L329445,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I'm staying pregnant, Le."
57252,L329444,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?"
57253,L329443,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!"
57254,L329442,u1661,m109,LEAH,"What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four."
57255,L329347,u1660,m109,JUNO,"It was magnificent, man!"
57256,L329346,u1661,m109,LEAH,"So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?"
57257,L329345,u1660,m109,JUNO,"It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state."
57258,L329344,u1661,m109,LEAH,Aha! You love him.
57259,L329343,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Like, a year ago, in Spanish class."
57260,L329342,u1661,m109,LEAH,When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
57261,L329341,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant."
57262,L329340,u1661,m109,LEAH,"So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?"
57263,L329339,u1660,m109,JUNO,"That is sick, man."
57264,L329338,u1661,m109,LEAH,Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
57265,L329337,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent."
57266,L329336,u1661,m109,LEAH,Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
57267,L329335,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now."
57268,L329334,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke."
57269,L329333,u1660,m109,JUNO,That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
57270,L329332,u1661,m109,LEAH,Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
57271,L329331,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Unfortunately, yes."
57272,L329330,u1661,m109,LEAH,"Is this for real? Like for real, for real?"
57273,L329329,u1660,m109,JUNO,"I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier."
57274,L329328,u1661,m109,LEAH,How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
57275,L329327,u1660,m109,JUNO,It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
57276,L329326,u1661,m109,LEAH,Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
57277,L329325,u1660,m109,JUNO,"Dude, I'm pregnant."
57278,L329324,u1661,m109,LEAH,Only the one in my pants.
57279,L329323,u1660,m109,JUNO,No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
57280,L329322,u1661,m109,LEAH,Is this Juno?
57281,L329321,u1660,m109,JUNO,I am a suicide risk.
57282,L329320,u1661,m109,LEAH,Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
57283,L329625,u1668,m109,VANESSA,You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
57284,L329624,u1662,m109,MAC,What do you make with that?
57285,L329623,u1668,m109,VANESSA,A Pilates machine?
57286,L329622,u1662,m109,MAC,So. What's that thing?
57287,L329584,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are."
57288,L329583,u1662,m109,MAC,Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
57289,L329582,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?"
57290,L329581,u1662,m109,MAC,You don't say.
57291,L329536,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
57292,L329535,u1662,m109,MAC,Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
57293,L330053,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Aren't you the cool guy?
57294,L330052,u1663,m109,MARK,It's a loft.
57295,L330051,u1668,m109,VANESSA,A hotel?
57296,L330050,u1663,m109,MARK,"Yeah, downtown."
57297,L330049,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Have you found a place to stay?
57298,L330048,u1663,m109,MARK,"Looks like it, yeah."
57299,L330047,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"We're actually, finally doing this?"
57300,L330046,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess."
57301,L330045,u1663,m109,MARK,"I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it ""collaborative divorce."" It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children."
57302,L330042,u1663,m109,MARK,Don't mock me.
57303,L330041,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Like what? Be a rock star?
57304,L330040,u1663,m109,MARK,I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
57305,L330039,u1668,m109,VANESSA,What would be a good time for you?
57306,L330036,u1663,m109,MARK,"Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock."
57307,L330035,u1668,m109,VANESSA,She answered our prayers.
57308,L330034,u1663,m109,MARK,"It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room."
57309,L330033,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?"
57310,L330031,u1663,m109,MARK,I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
57311,L330030,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
57312,L330029,u1663,m109,MARK,"I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready."
57313,L330028,u1668,m109,VANESSA,What are you referring to?
57314,L330027,u1663,m109,MARK,Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
57315,L330026,u1668,m109,VANESSA,What?
57316,L330025,u1663,m109,MARK,I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
57317,L330024,u1668,m109,VANESSA,What did you do?
57318,L330023,u1663,m109,MARK,"She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process."
57319,L330022,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Juno, what's the matter?"
57320,L329861,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Can you see it?
57321,L329860,u1663,m109,MARK,Hm.
57322,L329859,u1668,m109,VANESSA,That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
57323,L329858,u1668,m109,VANESSA,And I disagree.
57324,L329857,u1663,m109,MARK,I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
57325,L329856,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"You should read the book. I even flagged the ""daddy chapters"" for you."
57326,L329855,u1663,m109,MARK,"Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?"
57327,L329854,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called ""nesting."""
57328,L329853,u1663,m109,MARK,Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
57329,L329852,u1668,m109,VANESSA,I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
57330,L329851,u1663,m109,MARK,Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
57331,L329850,u1668,m109,VANESSA,"Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette."
57332,L329849,u1663,m109,MARK,They're yellow.
57333,L329848,u1668,m109,VANESSA,What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
57334,L329633,u1663,m109,MARK,Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
57335,L329632,u1668,m109,VANESSA,You guys are playing music?
57336,L329580,u1668,m109,VANESSA,I want to be a mommy so badly!
57337,L329579,u1663,m109,MARK,Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
57338,L329578,u1668,m109,VANESSA,You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
57339,L329575,u1668,m109,VANESSA,Are you looking for any other compensation?
57340,L329574,u1663,m109,MARK,"Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses."
57341,L334180,u1670,m110,ADELE,"There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that."
57342,L334179,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Adele for god sake please lis...
57343,L334178,u1670,m110,ADELE,...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
57344,L334177,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
57345,L334176,u1670,m110,ADELE,...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
57346,L333905,u1672,m110,BRIAN,I suppose anything's possible.
57347,L333904,u1670,m110,ADELE,You lose!
57348,L333812,u1670,m110,ADELE,Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
57349,L333811,u1672,m110,BRIAN,No.
57350,L334152,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend."
57351,L334151,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man."
57352,L334148,u1670,m110,ADELE,That's not true!
57353,L334147,u1674,m110,CARRIE,What?
57354,L334146,u1670,m110,ADELE,...That's not true.
57355,L334145,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"The police are after him, he's a murderer!"
57356,L333971,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Jeez... Adele!
57357,L333970,u1670,m110,ADELE,An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
57358,L333969,u1674,m110,CARRIE,...Anything else?
57359,L333968,u1670,m110,ADELE,Carryin' a gun.
57360,L333967,u1674,m110,CARRIE,What's Early been in jail for?
57361,L333966,u1670,m110,ADELE,"My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once."
57362,L333945,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Yeah.
57363,L333944,u1670,m110,ADELE,"You think Early's bad to me, don't you?"
57364,L333943,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Adele... are you serious?
57365,L333942,u1670,m110,ADELE,Do what?
57366,L333941,u1674,m110,CARRIE,You shouldn't let him do that to you...
57367,L333940,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week."
57368,L333939,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Hold still.
57369,L333938,u1670,m110,ADELE,No it is not!
57370,L333937,u1674,m110,CARRIE,That's me.
57371,L333936,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Took 'em all.
57372,L333935,u1670,m110,ADELE,You took this picture?
57373,L333933,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Sure.
57374,L333932,u1670,m110,ADELE,Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
57375,L333931,u1674,m110,CARRIE,It's a portfolio of my work.
57376,L333930,u1670,m110,ADELE,What's this?
57377,L333929,u1670,m110,ADELE,Could I try that?
57378,L333928,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I'm cool.
57379,L333918,u1670,m110,ADELE,You can?
57380,L333917,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?"
57381,L333913,u1674,m110,CARRIE,How'd you meet Early?
57382,L333912,u1670,m110,ADELE,I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
57383,L333890,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
57384,L333889,u1670,m110,ADELE,...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
57385,L333879,u1674,m110,CARRIE,He whips you?
57386,L333878,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Better not, or Early'd whip me."
57387,L333877,u1674,m110,CARRIE,So you don't do any of those things.
57388,L333876,u1670,m110,ADELE,Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
57389,L333872,u1670,m110,ADELE,Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
57390,L333871,u1674,m110,CARRIE,You dropped this.
57391,L333778,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"...Yeah, sure."
57392,L333777,u1670,m110,ADELE,"You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?"
57393,L333750,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Not really.
57394,L333749,u1670,m110,ADELE,Is it hard to learn?
57395,L333748,u1674,m110,CARRIE,...Yeah.
57396,L333747,u1670,m110,ADELE,Are you takin' the pictures?
57397,L333744,u1670,m110,ADELE,That French ain't it?
57398,L333743,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you."
57399,L333742,u1670,m110,ADELE,What?
57400,L333741,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Karma.
57401,L333740,u1670,m110,ADELE,"One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over..."
57402,L333730,u1674,m110,CARRIE,...Thank you.
57403,L333729,u1670,m110,ADELE,"...I said, I like your hair."
57404,L333728,u1674,m110,CARRIE,...Pardon?
57405,L333726,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Carrie.
57406,L333725,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Hi, I'm Adele."
57407,L334212,u1670,m110,ADELE,"I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people."
57408,L334211,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit."
57409,L334208,u1670,m110,ADELE,Early! Stop!!
57410,L334207,u1675,m110,EARLY,Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
57411,L334185,u1670,m110,ADELE,She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
57412,L334184,u1675,m110,EARLY,What's wrong with her?
57413,L334169,u1675,m110,EARLY,Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
57414,L334168,u1670,m110,ADELE,...I don't know.
57415,L334167,u1675,m110,EARLY,Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
57416,L334166,u1670,m110,ADELE,...thank you.
57417,L334099,u1670,m110,ADELE,"I don't know, they didn't speak too good English."
57418,L334098,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Yeah but, what is it?"
57419,L334097,u1670,m110,ADELE,"It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth..."
57420,L334096,u1675,m110,EARLY,What the hell is this stuff?
57421,L334063,u1675,m110,EARLY,Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
57422,L334062,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Early, what're you doin'?"
57423,L333825,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Early, sing me a song."
57424,L333824,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper."
57425,L333784,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Early, can we stop there... just for a little while."
57426,L333783,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Shush, Adele."
57427,L333722,u1675,m110,EARLY,As many times as it takes.
57428,L333721,u1670,m110,ADELE,How many times you gonna tell me that?
57429,L333720,u1675,m110,EARLY,"You just smile, let me do all the talking."
57430,L333719,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Geez, they look kinda weird."
57431,L333712,u1675,m110,EARLY,Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
57432,L333711,u1670,m110,ADELE,Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
57433,L333709,u1675,m110,EARLY,They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
57434,L333708,u1670,m110,ADELE,What if they're dangerous?
57435,L333697,u1675,m110,EARLY,I heard that.
57436,L333696,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready."
57437,L333695,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it."
57438,L333694,u1670,m110,ADELE,You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
57439,L333693,u1675,m110,EARLY,Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
57440,L333692,u1670,m110,ADELE,What'll we do out there?
57441,L333691,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month..."
57442,L333690,u1670,m110,ADELE,I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
57443,L333689,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact."
57444,L333686,u1670,m110,ADELE,Almost.
57445,L333685,u1675,m110,EARLY,What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
57446,L333599,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there."
57447,L333598,u1670,m110,ADELE,"I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes."
57448,L333597,u1670,m110,ADELE,"Early, you are so sweet."
57449,L333596,u1675,m110,EARLY,Happy birthday Adele.
57450,L334082,u1671,m110,ATTENDANT,No sir.
57451,L334081,u1675,m110,EARLY,You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
57452,L334080,u1675,m110,EARLY,What do you need a Bible for?
57453,L334079,u1671,m110,ATTENDANT,...Mind if I hold that Bible?
57454,L334077,u1675,m110,EARLY,Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
57455,L334076,u1671,m110,ATTENDANT,Turkey mostly.
57456,L334075,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Never heard of it, any huntin'?"
57457,L334074,u1671,m110,ATTENDANT,"Vernon, Florida."
57458,L334073,u1675,m110,EARLY,Where you from Walter?
57459,L334068,u1675,m110,EARLY,I don't know. Wish I did.
57460,L334067,u1671,m110,ATTENDANT,Not so good. You sure you have to?
57461,L334066,u1675,m110,EARLY,Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
57462,L334065,u1671,m110,ATTENDANT,Walter Livesy.
57463,L334064,u1675,m110,EARLY,"What's your name, boy?"
57464,L334221,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman."
57465,L334220,u1672,m110,BRIAN,What happened to Adele?
57466,L334219,u1675,m110,EARLY,You two been busy in here.
57467,L334132,u1672,m110,BRIAN,They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
57468,L334131,u1675,m110,EARLY,...and?
57469,L334130,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back."
57470,L334129,u1675,m110,EARLY,So tell me... what happened here?
57471,L334123,u1675,m110,EARLY,Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
57472,L334122,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Forget about it, doesn't matter."
57473,L334121,u1675,m110,EARLY,Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
57474,L334116,u1672,m110,BRIAN,...Ha.
57475,L334115,u1675,m110,EARLY,Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
57476,L334110,u1675,m110,EARLY,Damn right I do.
57477,L334109,u1672,m110,BRIAN,If you say so.
57478,L334108,u1675,m110,EARLY,"...Well then, that's how many I killed."
57479,L333980,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there."
57480,L333979,u1675,m110,EARLY,"...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it."
57481,L333926,u1675,m110,EARLY,Nah... how much money have you got?
57482,L333925,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
57483,L333924,u1675,m110,EARLY,Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
57484,L333923,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Yeah?
57485,L333922,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know."
57486,L333921,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"By the way, I'm not much of a pool player."
57487,L333901,u1675,m110,EARLY,Ain't you goin' to record it?
57488,L333900,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Sure.
57489,L333899,u1675,m110,EARLY,You wanna hear mine?
57490,L333898,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Yeah.
57491,L333897,u1675,m110,EARLY,"That your... ""theory"", ain't that what they call it?"
57492,L333896,u1672,m110,BRIAN,I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
57493,L333895,u1675,m110,EARLY,You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
57494,L333894,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
57495,L333893,u1675,m110,EARLY,Now why is that?
57496,L333892,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Dahlia, no."
57497,L333891,u1675,m110,EARLY,"...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?"
57498,L333883,u1675,m110,EARLY,...Then some.
57499,L333882,u1672,m110,BRIAN,That bad?
57500,L333870,u1672,m110,BRIAN,He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
57501,L333869,u1675,m110,EARLY,How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
57502,L333867,u1675,m110,EARLY,Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
57503,L333866,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
57504,L333865,u1675,m110,EARLY,Henry Lucas.
57505,L333864,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Who?
57506,L333863,u1675,m110,EARLY,This guy killed a mess of people.
57507,L333862,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"It's just a work in progress, kinda rough."
57508,L333861,u1675,m110,EARLY,This the book your writing?
57509,L333774,u1675,m110,EARLY,Forget it.
57510,L333773,u1672,m110,BRIAN,How much do I owe you?
57511,L333772,u1675,m110,EARLY,Can't hurt.
57512,L333753,u1675,m110,EARLY,...Too bad.
57513,L333752,u1672,m110,BRIAN,That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
57514,L333751,u1675,m110,EARLY,You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
57515,L333739,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to..."
57516,L333738,u1672,m110,BRIAN,So what do you do Early?
57517,L333736,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite."
57518,L333735,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Brian.
57519,L333734,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler."
57520,L333733,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early."
57521,L333732,u1675,m110,EARLY,Best kind.
57522,L333731,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Tight fit.
57523,L334217,u1672,m110,BRIAN,I don't know.
57524,L334216,u1674,m110,CARRIE,What about you?
57525,L334215,u1672,m110,BRIAN,I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
57526,L334214,u1674,m110,CARRIE,What are you going to do?
57527,L334213,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Carrie, watch for Early."
57528,L334194,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Then try again,"
57529,L334193,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
57530,L334192,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you."
57531,L334174,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!"
57532,L334173,u1674,m110,CARRIE,What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
57533,L334172,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Carrie... stop it.
57534,L334044,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
57535,L334043,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Why, what did he do?"
57536,L334042,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Brian I want him out of our car!
57537,L334041,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
57538,L334040,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too."
57539,L334039,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I can't believe I agreed to do this.
57540,L334038,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos."
57541,L334037,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?"
57542,L334034,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I'm finished.
57543,L334033,u1672,m110,BRIAN,There's more...
57544,L334029,u1672,m110,BRIAN,A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
57545,L334028,u1674,m110,CARRIE,What's that?
57546,L334018,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Look again!
57547,L334017,u1672,m110,BRIAN,What is it?
57548,L333998,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
57549,L333997,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state."
57550,L333993,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"She told me...  ...but only when she ""deserves"" it. Did you know he was in jail?"
57551,L333992,u1672,m110,BRIAN,How do you know that?
57552,L333991,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her."
57553,L333989,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang."
57554,L333988,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Who said he's my good buddy?
57555,L333860,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Take your time.
57556,L333859,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Fuck!
57557,L333858,u1672,m110,BRIAN,All set?
57558,L333833,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I don't want to talk about it.
57559,L333832,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Carrie.
57560,L333831,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else."
57561,L333830,u1672,m110,BRIAN,...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
57562,L333822,u1672,m110,BRIAN,I heard that.
57563,L333821,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Up yours.
57564,L333820,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Bitch, bitch, bitch!"
57565,L333819,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
57566,L333818,u1672,m110,BRIAN,He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
57567,L333817,u1674,m110,CARRIE,You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
57568,L333804,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay."
57569,L333803,u1672,m110,BRIAN,We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
57570,L333718,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Lighten up...
57571,L333717,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
57572,L333705,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"Funny, very funny."
57573,L333704,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta ""Deliverance.""  ""Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"""
57574,L333702,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?"
57575,L333701,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I still think we should have met them first.
57576,L333700,u1672,m110,BRIAN,I like that.
57577,L333699,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
57578,L333698,u1674,m110,CARRIE,What did he sound like on the phone?
57579,L333666,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out."
57580,L333665,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you."
57581,L333664,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  ""We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."""
57582,L333663,u1672,m110,BRIAN,A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
57583,L333662,u1674,m110,CARRIE,A book on the warehouse murders?
57584,L333661,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together."
57585,L333660,u1674,m110,CARRIE,This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
57586,L333659,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
57587,L333658,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Why?
57588,L333657,u1672,m110,BRIAN,...and I think I know why.
57589,L333656,u1672,m110,BRIAN,...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
57590,L333655,u1674,m110,CARRIE,So how's it going?
57591,L333654,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing."
57592,L333653,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Thanks. What are you doing?
57593,L333652,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
57594,L333629,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
57595,L333628,u1672,m110,BRIAN,...just like that?
57596,L333627,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late."
57597,L333626,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we..."
57598,L333625,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can."
57599,L333624,u1672,m110,BRIAN,...I do.
57600,L333623,u1674,m110,CARRIE,I thought you wanted to be a writer.
57601,L333605,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
57602,L333604,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
57603,L333603,u1674,m110,CARRIE,It was definitely the high point of the evening.
57604,L333602,u1672,m110,BRIAN,The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
57605,L333601,u1674,m110,CARRIE,The party?
57606,L333600,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
57607,L333589,u1672,m110,BRIAN,A... I gotta go.
57608,L333588,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
57609,L333587,u1672,m110,BRIAN,"Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake."
57610,L333580,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Thank god!
57611,L333579,u1672,m110,BRIAN,Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
57612,L333572,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!"
57613,L333571,u1673,m110,CAROL,"I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND."

57638,L334005,u1675,m110,EARLY,Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
57639,L334004,u1674,m110,CARRIE,...Brian hurt his foot.
57640,L334003,u1675,m110,EARLY,Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
57641,L333856,u1674,m110,CARRIE,"No, thanks, I can manage."

57643,L333846,u1675,m110,EARLY,She wasn't feeling so good.
57644,L333845,u1674,m110,CARRIE,Where's Adele?
57645,L333844,u1675,m110,EARLY,Bri'.
57646,L333649,u1675,m110,EARLY,"Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job."
57647,L333648,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,...Janitor's job.
57648,L333647,u1675,m110,EARLY,What is it?
57649,L333646,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,"You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp."
57650,L333641,u1675,m110,EARLY,I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
57651,L333640,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
57652,L333637,u1675,m110,EARLY,Wasn't my fault...
57653,L333636,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,"You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there."
57654,L333768,u1677,m110,POLICE OFFICER,Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
57655,L333767,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
57656,L333766,u1677,m110,POLICE OFFICER,...That'd be my guess.
57657,L333765,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,...Diebold?
57658,L333763,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,"No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this."
57659,L333762,u1677,m110,POLICE OFFICER,"What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?"
57660,L333761,u1677,m110,POLICE OFFICER,Without his car?
57661,L333760,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,"Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas."
57662,L333759,u1677,m110,POLICE OFFICER,Where would we find him?
57663,L333758,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,Could be.
57664,L333757,u1677,m110,POLICE OFFICER,"Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?"
57665,L333756,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,His Parole Officer.
57666,L333755,u1677,m110,POLICE OFFICER,Who are you?
57667,L333754,u1676,m110,PAROLE OFFICER,What happened?
57668,L334586,u1678,m111,BLACK NURSE,Now you gotta be careful.
57669,L334585,u1691,m111,RUBY,Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.

57679,L334559,u1691,m111,RUBY,"With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three."
57680,L334558,u1678,m111,BLACK NURSE,How many times have you gone unprotected?
57681,L334557,u1691,m111,RUBY,"Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine."
57682,L334556,u1678,m111,BLACK NURSE,Yes. Altogether.
57683,L334555,u1691,m111,RUBY,Umm. Altogether?
57684,L334554,u1678,m111,BLACK NURSE,How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
57685,L334551,u1691,m111,RUBY,17.
57686,L334550,u1678,m111,BLACK NURSE,How old you?
57687,L334863,u1696,m111,TELLY,Hold up man.

57689,L334694,u1679,m111,CASPER,That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
57690,L334693,u1696,m111,TELLY,Why not? You stink.
57691,L334692,u1679,m111,CASPER,Nah.
57692,L334689,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles."
57693,L334688,u1696,m111,TELLY,You are?
57694,L334687,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
57695,L334686,u1696,m111,TELLY,Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
57696,L334685,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Yo, you got any weed around here?"
57697,L334684,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah probably.
57698,L334683,u1696,m111,TELLY,You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
57699,L334680,u1696,m111,TELLY,Fifteen for me.
57700,L334679,u1679,m111,CASPER,About ten. Fifteen is good.
57701,L334678,u1696,m111,TELLY,I don't know. How much do you want?
57702,L334677,u1679,m111,CASPER,How much you gonna take?
57703,L334674,u1696,m111,TELLY,Shut the fuck up.
57704,L334673,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties."
57705,L334672,u1696,m111,TELLY,Yeah.
57706,L334671,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big."
57707,L334641,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs."
57708,L334640,u1696,m111,TELLY,Good luck?
57709,L334639,u1679,m111,CASPER,"So really, it's good luck."
57710,L334638,u1679,m111,CASPER,"I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did."
57711,L334637,u1696,m111,TELLY,Shut up.
57712,L334636,u1679,m111,CASPER,"I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off."
57713,L334635,u1696,m111,TELLY,Right.
57714,L334634,u1679,m111,CASPER,So. You never know when you can end up like that.
57715,L334633,u1696,m111,TELLY,"So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks."
57716,L334632,u1679,m111,CASPER,So.
57717,L334631,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by."
57718,L334630,u1679,m111,CASPER,What are you talking about?
57719,L334629,u1696,m111,TELLY,That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
57720,L334628,u1679,m111,CASPER,Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
57721,L334627,u1696,m111,TELLY,Yeah. Why you give money.
57722,L334626,u1679,m111,CASPER,Why I give pennies?
57723,L334625,u1696,m111,TELLY,That.
57724,L334624,u1679,m111,CASPER,Why I do what?
57725,L334623,u1696,m111,TELLY,I don't understand why you do that.
57726,L334619,u1696,m111,TELLY,I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
57727,L334618,u1679,m111,CASPER,You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
57728,L334617,u1679,m111,CASPER,Bet.
57729,L334616,u1696,m111,TELLY,I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
57730,L334615,u1679,m111,CASPER,How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
57731,L334614,u1696,m111,TELLY,I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
57732,L334613,u1679,m111,CASPER,She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
57733,L334612,u1696,m111,TELLY,"At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin."
57734,L334611,u1679,m111,CASPER,I know what you mean.
57735,L334610,u1696,m111,TELLY,"I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection."
57736,L334609,u1696,m111,TELLY,"And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on."
57737,L334608,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah.
57738,L334607,u1696,m111,TELLY,I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
57739,L334606,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah.
57740,L334605,u1696,m111,TELLY,"She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her."
57741,L334604,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah.
57742,L334603,u1696,m111,TELLY,It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
57743,L334602,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah. She's only 13.
57744,L334601,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent."
57745,L334600,u1679,m111,CASPER,Darcy?
57746,L334599,u1696,m111,TELLY,Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
57747,L334598,u1679,m111,CASPER,Oh. You like her?
57748,L334597,u1696,m111,TELLY,Darcy. Benny's little sister.
57749,L334596,u1679,m111,CASPER,Who?
57750,L334595,u1696,m111,TELLY,I wanna fuck Darcy.
57751,L334575,u1696,m111,TELLY,He looks like my uncle.
57752,L334574,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Man, this guy is really good."
57753,L334516,u1696,m111,TELLY,No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
57754,L334515,u1679,m111,CASPER,I hate this game.
57755,L334470,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah me too nigga.
57756,L334469,u1696,m111,TELLY,I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
57757,L334468,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yep.
57758,L334467,u1696,m111,TELLY,But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
57759,L334408,u1696,m111,TELLY,Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
57760,L334407,u1679,m111,CASPER,That girl you boned last year. Remember?
57761,L334386,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire."
57762,L334385,u1679,m111,CASPER,Can you do it man?
57763,L334384,u1679,m111,CASPER,"No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated ""Wonder Twins""!"
57764,L334383,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring."
57765,L334382,u1679,m111,CASPER,And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
57766,L334381,u1696,m111,TELLY,Right.
57767,L334380,u1679,m111,CASPER,"And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?"
57768,L334379,u1696,m111,TELLY,Right.
57769,L334378,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Well, those guys share everything, right?"
57770,L334377,u1696,m111,TELLY,Yeah.
57771,L334376,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Yeah. ""The Wonder Twins"". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water."
57772,L334375,u1696,m111,TELLY,The cartoon?
57773,L334374,u1679,m111,CASPER,"You know like in ""The Wonder Twins"" they share everything."
57774,L334363,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Unzip my pack, yo."
57775,L334362,u1696,m111,TELLY,You down with the boost?
57776,L334361,u1679,m111,CASPER,Three pennies and a ball of lint.
57777,L334360,u1696,m111,TELLY,You got any money?
57778,L334359,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Yeah, I feel dehydrated."
57779,L334358,u1696,m111,TELLY,You thirsty?
57780,L334357,u1679,m111,CASPER,They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
57781,L334356,u1696,m111,TELLY,Yep.
57782,L334355,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first."
57783,L334354,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it."
57784,L334353,u1679,m111,CASPER,"It's no big deal, right?"
57785,L334352,u1696,m111,TELLY,"I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost."
57786,L334351,u1679,m111,CASPER,It is right.
57787,L334350,u1696,m111,TELLY,I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
57788,L334349,u1679,m111,CASPER,Why?
57789,L334348,u1696,m111,TELLY,A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
57790,L334347,u1679,m111,CASPER,Did she suck your dick?
57791,L334346,u1696,m111,TELLY,Yeah.
57792,L334345,u1679,m111,CASPER,Telly.
57793,L334344,u1679,m111,CASPER,Den less go Joe.

57810,L334327,u1696,m111,TELLY,"I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect."
57811,L334326,u1679,m111,CASPER,She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
57812,L334325,u1696,m111,TELLY,"That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen."
57813,L334324,u1679,m111,CASPER,You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
57814,L334323,u1696,m111,TELLY,"I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit."
57815,L334322,u1679,m111,CASPER,What do you mean?
57816,L334321,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies."
57817,L334320,u1679,m111,CASPER,To what? Virgins?
57818,L334319,u1696,m111,TELLY,I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
57819,L334317,u1696,m111,TELLY,"And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl."
57820,L334316,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah.
57821,L334315,u1696,m111,TELLY,"And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby."
57822,L334314,u1696,m111,TELLY,"And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup."
57823,L334313,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah.
57824,L334312,u1696,m111,TELLY,"And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little."
57825,L334311,u1679,m111,CASPER,Right.
57826,L334310,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right."
57827,L334309,u1679,m111,CASPER,How?
57828,L334308,u1696,m111,TELLY,I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
57829,L334307,u1679,m111,CASPER,What?

57832,L334303,u1696,m111,TELLY,You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
57833,L334302,u1679,m111,CASPER,"Oh man, that's the best."
57834,L334301,u1696,m111,TELLY,Hell's yeah. She was so clean.

57838,L334296,u1679,m111,CASPER,Yeah.
57839,L334295,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time."
57840,L334294,u1679,m111,CASPER,How long did you fuck her?
57841,L334293,u1696,m111,TELLY,Did what take?
57842,L334292,u1679,m111,CASPER,Oh shit. How long did it take?
57843,L334291,u1696,m111,TELLY,Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
57844,L334290,u1679,m111,CASPER,She can fuck?

57921,L334933,u1680,m111,DARCY,I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
57922,L334932,u1696,m111,TELLY,She won't? Why not?

57995,L334847,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Your a real philosopher.
57996,L334845,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,"Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, ""Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk"" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier."
57997,L334844,u1685,m111,JENNIE,What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
57998,L334843,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
57999,L334842,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Yeah?
58000,L334841,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,"I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes."
58001,L334838,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
58002,L334837,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Thanks.
58003,L334836,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,"Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her."
58004,L334835,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Yeah?
58005,L334834,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
58006,L334833,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Am I getting warm?
58007,L334832,u1685,m111,JENNIE,No.
58008,L334831,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Are you in trouble with the law?
58009,L334830,u1685,m111,JENNIE,No.
58010,L334829,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
58011,L334828,u1685,m111,JENNIE,"Yeah, I guess so."
58012,L334827,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,"No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?"
58013,L334826,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Everything is wrong.
58014,L334825,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,"Miss, would I be prying?"
58015,L334822,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
58016,L334821,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Sorry.
58017,L334820,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
58018,L334819,u1685,m111,JENNIE,"Yeah well, it's been a bad day."
58019,L334818,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,"Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all..."
58020,L334817,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Yeah.
58021,L334816,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,You're OK?
58022,L334815,u1685,m111,JENNIE,No. I'm OK. Thanks.
58023,L334814,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,"Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe."
58024,L334813,u1685,m111,JENNIE,What?
58025,L334812,u1695,m111,TAXI DRIVER,Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
58026,L334713,u1690,m111,PAUL,Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
58027,L334712,u1685,m111,JENNIE,I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?

58037,L334652,u1685,m111,JENNIE,I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
58038,L334647,u1685,m111,JENNIE,I only did it once and...
58039,L334646,u1691,m111,RUBY,Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
58040,L334645,u1685,m111,JENNIE,"That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore."
58041,L334644,u1691,m111,RUBY,"Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK."
58042,L334580,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Good luck.
58043,L334579,u1691,m111,RUBY,Wish me luck.

58045,L334523,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
58046,L334522,u1691,m111,RUBY,"Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever."
58047,L334521,u1685,m111,JENNIE,"And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging."
58048,L334520,u1691,m111,RUBY,"Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear."
58049,L334519,u1685,m111,JENNIE,I hate sucking dick!
58050,L334478,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Mine are like my neck and my chest.

58052,L334476,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Like where are your erogenous zones?
58053,L334475,u1691,m111,RUBY,"Hell yeah, they don't know."
58054,L334474,u1685,m111,JENNIE,"Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know."
58055,L334462,u1691,m111,RUBY,Boom!!! Boom!!!
58056,L334461,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Passion...

58059,L334441,u1691,m111,RUBY,Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
58060,L334431,u1685,m111,JENNIE,"No, I didn't bleed."
58061,L334430,u1691,m111,RUBY,You didn't?
58062,L334429,u1685,m111,JENNIE,I didn't bleed.

58067,L334424,u1691,m111,RUBY,The pain. The fucking pain!

58075,L334901,u1685,m111,JENNIE,Do you know where he went?
58076,L334900,u1688,m111,MISHA,I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.

58091,L334525,u1687,m111,LINDA,And you don't get shit out of it.
58092,L334495,u1687,m111,LINDA,Because he can like climax you up to that...
58093,L334494,u1693,m111,SUSAN,Yep.
58094,L334493,u1687,m111,LINDA,That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
58095,L334492,u1693,m111,SUSAN,I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
58096,L334473,u1693,m111,SUSAN,You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
58097,L334472,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yep.
58098,L334471,u1693,m111,SUSAN,You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
58099,L334459,u1693,m111,SUSAN,It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
58100,L334458,u1687,m111,LINDA,"Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex."
58101,L334549,u1687,m111,LINDA,Did they ask you a lot of questions?
58102,L334548,u1691,m111,RUBY,I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
58103,L334547,u1691,m111,RUBY,"And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie."
58104,L334546,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yeah.
58105,L334545,u1691,m111,RUBY,"And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe."
58106,L334544,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yeah.
58107,L334543,u1691,m111,RUBY,I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
58108,L334508,u1687,m111,LINDA,I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
58109,L334507,u1691,m111,RUBY,Yeah I get bored.
58110,L334506,u1687,m111,LINDA,Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
58111,L334505,u1691,m111,RUBY,Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
58112,L334504,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
58113,L334500,u1691,m111,RUBY,Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
58114,L334499,u1687,m111,LINDA,But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
58115,L334498,u1691,m111,RUBY,Yep.
58116,L334482,u1691,m111,RUBY,"And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco"
58117,L334481,u1687,m111,LINDA,Oh shit.
58118,L334480,u1691,m111,RUBY,"Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there..."
58119,L334479,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
58120,L334455,u1691,m111,RUBY,It's really slow. It's slow boring.
58121,L334454,u1687,m111,LINDA,Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
58122,L334453,u1691,m111,RUBY,Yeah.
58123,L334452,u1687,m111,LINDA,"You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww."
58124,L334451,u1691,m111,RUBY,It's like...
58125,L334450,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yeah.
58126,L334447,u1687,m111,LINDA,Sweet.
58127,L334446,u1691,m111,RUBY,Making love is like.
58128,L334445,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yep.
58129,L334444,u1691,m111,RUBY,"Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!"
58130,L334443,u1687,m111,LINDA,Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
58131,L334792,u1696,m111,TELLY,I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
58132,L334791,u1688,m111,MISHA,What?!
58133,L334790,u1696,m111,TELLY,No. I was just kidding.
58134,L334789,u1688,m111,MISHA,Holy shit. That's all true?
58135,L334788,u1696,m111,TELLY,Yep.
58136,L334787,u1688,m111,MISHA,Oh god. That's horrible.
58137,L334786,u1696,m111,TELLY,So that's why Casper is how he is.
58138,L334767,u1688,m111,MISHA,No.
58139,L334766,u1696,m111,TELLY,You've heard the stories right?
58140,L334765,u1688,m111,MISHA,Yeah?
58141,L334764,u1696,m111,TELLY,It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
58142,L334763,u1688,m111,MISHA,I hate 'em.
58143,L334762,u1696,m111,TELLY,He still does.
58144,L334761,u1688,m111,MISHA,Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
58145,L334760,u1696,m111,TELLY,You think so?
58146,L334759,u1688,m111,MISHA,How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
58147,L334704,u1696,m111,TELLY,All right.
58148,L334703,u1689,m111,MOM,"If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name."
58149,L334702,u1696,m111,TELLY,Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
58150,L334701,u1696,m111,TELLY,Not too late.
58151,L334700,u1689,m111,MOM,Four-thirty in the morning?
58152,L334699,u1696,m111,TELLY,Not too late.

58154,L334697,u1696,m111,TELLY,I'm gonna go out for a little while.
58155,L334696,u1689,m111,MOM,Shh.
58156,L334695,u1696,m111,TELLY,Mom.
58157,L334670,u1689,m111,MOM,That's right.

58163,L334540,u1690,m111,PAUL,That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
58164,L334403,u1690,m111,PAUL,"Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub."
58165,L334402,u1696,m111,TELLY,Where does everyone sleep?
58166,L334401,u1690,m111,PAUL,"I don't know, eight or nine."
58167,L334400,u1696,m111,TELLY,"So, how many people live here now?"
58168,L334395,u1696,m111,TELLY,Nah.
58169,L334394,u1690,m111,PAUL,You want a wip-it?
58170,L334393,u1696,m111,TELLY,Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
58171,L334392,u1690,m111,PAUL,What are you guys doing?
58172,L334391,u1696,m111,TELLY,Paul it's Telly. Open up.
58173,L334390,u1690,m111,PAUL,Hello?
58174,L334389,u1696,m111,TELLY,It's me. Telly.
58175,L334388,u1690,m111,PAUL,Hello?
58176,L334534,u1691,m111,RUBY,You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
58177,L334533,u1693,m111,SUSAN,Yeah.
58178,L334532,u1691,m111,RUBY,"No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something."
58179,L334531,u1693,m111,SUSAN,"It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter."
58180,L334530,u1691,m111,RUBY,It was... it was.
58181,L334503,u1693,m111,SUSAN,"Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half."
58182,L334502,u1691,m111,RUBY,To come?
58183,L334501,u1693,m111,SUSAN,Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
58184,L334486,u1691,m111,RUBY,He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
58185,L334485,u1693,m111,SUSAN,Yeah.
58186,L334484,u1691,m111,RUBY,And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
58187,L334483,u1693,m111,SUSAN,Right.
58188,L334457,u1691,m111,RUBY,It's very monotonous.
58189,L334456,u1693,m111,SUSAN,Yeah.
58190,L334449,u1691,m111,RUBY,It's grandmother style.
58191,L334448,u1693,m111,SUSAN,Slow.
58192,L334420,u1691,m111,RUBY,"That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit."
58193,L334419,u1693,m111,SUSAN,First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
58194,L335008,u1696,m111,TELLY,OK.
58195,L335007,u1692,m111,STEVEN,Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
58196,L335006,u1696,m111,TELLY,Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
58197,L335005,u1692,m111,STEVEN,I can't man.
58198,L335004,u1696,m111,TELLY,"Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while."
58199,L335003,u1692,m111,STEVEN,What man? What is it?
58200,L337196,u1698,m112,ANDY,Sit down!
58201,L337195,u1708,m112,PETER,The message!  I figured out--
58202,L337156,u1708,m112,PETER,What?
58203,L337155,u1698,m112,ANDY,"You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!"
58204,L337060,u1708,m112,PETER,Get off me!
58205,L337059,u1698,m112,ANDY,Yes you are.
58206,L337057,u1698,m112,ANDY,"It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish."
58207,L337056,u1708,m112,PETER,Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
58208,L337055,u1698,m112,ANDY,You're a lying bastard!
58209,L337054,u1708,m112,PETER,I'm positive.
58210,L337053,u1698,m112,ANDY,You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
58211,L337052,u1708,m112,PETER,I was at the beach.
58212,L337051,u1698,m112,ANDY,We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
58213,L336973,u1698,m112,ANDY,Homesearchers.
58214,L336972,u1708,m112,PETER,Then let's narrow it down.
58215,L336929,u1708,m112,PETER,"If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it."
58216,L336928,u1698,m112,ANDY,Then what's he talking about?
58217,L336927,u1708,m112,PETER,He's not talking about himself.
58218,L336920,u1698,m112,ANDY,There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
58219,L336919,u1708,m112,PETER,"No, I need the original note."
58220,L336918,u1698,m112,ANDY,You got it on the board.
58221,L336834,u1698,m112,ANDY,"Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker."
58222,L336833,u1708,m112,PETER,What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
58223,L336832,u1698,m112,ANDY,"I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap."
58224,L336831,u1708,m112,PETER,No.
58225,L336830,u1698,m112,ANDY,"You ever do any hunting, Peter?"
58226,L336829,u1708,m112,PETER,What do you want?
58227,L336828,u1698,m112,ANDY,Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
58228,L336827,u1708,m112,PETER,No it wasn't.
58229,L336826,u1698,m112,ANDY,The door was open.
58230,L336825,u1708,m112,PETER,How'd you get in here?
58231,L336824,u1698,m112,ANDY,That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
58232,L336823,u1708,m112,PETER,I wouldn't know.
58233,L336822,u1698,m112,ANDY,"You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?"
58234,L336745,u1708,m112,PETER,You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
58235,L336744,u1698,m112,ANDY,You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
58236,L336743,u1708,m112,PETER,Maybe you should.
58237,L336742,u1698,m112,ANDY,"We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor."
58238,L336739,u1708,m112,PETER,You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
58239,L336738,u1698,m112,ANDY,What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
58240,L336728,u1708,m112,PETER,Let's see how much he wants to play.
58241,L336727,u1698,m112,ANDY,Are you crazy?
58242,L336617,u1708,m112,PETER,"Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. ""Her God has gone and left his home."""
58243,L336616,u1698,m112,ANDY,What?
58244,L336615,u1708,m112,PETER,Morpheus.
58245,L336603,u1708,m112,PETER,"His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it."
58246,L336602,u1698,m112,ANDY,All you gotta do is look at the map.
58247,L336601,u1708,m112,PETER,He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
58248,L336600,u1698,m112,ANDY,"What do you mean, no?"
58249,L336599,u1708,m112,PETER,No.
58250,L336598,u1698,m112,ANDY,"Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random."
58251,L336436,u1698,m112,ANDY,"Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it."
58252,L336435,u1708,m112,PETER,He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
58253,L336434,u1698,m112,ANDY,"You like to play games, don't you, Peter?"
58254,L336433,u1708,m112,PETER,That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
58255,L336432,u1698,m112,ANDY,"It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent."
58256,L336431,u1708,m112,PETER,What's that supposed to mean?
58257,L336427,u1708,m112,PETER,"Fine, don't ask me out on a date."
58258,L336426,u1698,m112,ANDY,You are!  I don't like you.
58259,L336425,u1708,m112,PETER,It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
58260,L336424,u1698,m112,ANDY,Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
58261,L336423,u1708,m112,PETER,Casual.
58262,L336383,u1708,m112,PETER,What are you saying?
58263,L336382,u1698,m112,ANDY,I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
58264,L336381,u1708,m112,PETER,What kind of problem?
58265,L336380,u1698,m112,ANDY,We seem to have a little problem here?
58266,L336373,u1708,m112,PETER,Yes.
58267,L336372,u1698,m112,ANDY,By yourself?
58268,L336367,u1708,m112,PETER,Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
58269,L336366,u1698,m112,ANDY,I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
58270,L336980,u1709,m112,WOMAN,What's the first street?
58271,L336979,u1698,m112,ANDY,"I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do."
58272,L336978,u1709,m112,WOMAN,What are you talking about?
58273,L336977,u1698,m112,ANDY,"You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway."
58274,L336976,u1709,m112,WOMAN,It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
58275,L336975,u1698,m112,ANDY,I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
58276,L336974,u1709,m112,WOMAN,You want me to what?
58277,L337179,u1703,m112,FRANK,I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
58278,L337178,u1698,m112,ANDY,Ready for round two?
58279,L337137,u1703,m112,FRANK,It's a voice modulator.
58280,L337136,u1698,m112,ANDY,What is it?
58281,L337008,u1703,m112,FRANK,Find him!  I want to talk to him.
58282,L337007,u1698,m112,ANDY,I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
58283,L337006,u1703,m112,FRANK,Sanderson?
58284,L337005,u1698,m112,ANDY,I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
58285,L337004,u1703,m112,FRANK,"I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?"
58286,L337003,u1698,m112,ANDY,You alright?
58287,L337002,u1703,m112,FRANK,"She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it."
58288,L337001,u1698,m112,ANDY,How is she?
58289,L336613,u1703,m112,FRANK,Maybe he's going to drug her?
58290,L336612,u1698,m112,ANDY,We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
58291,L336576,u1698,m112,ANDY,"Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?"
58292,L336575,u1703,m112,FRANK,You still having a problem with this?
58293,L336561,u1703,m112,FRANK,Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
58294,L336560,u1698,m112,ANDY,The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
58295,L336550,u1703,m112,FRANK,Anything?
58296,L336549,u1698,m112,ANDY,Sorry.
58297,L336444,u1703,m112,FRANK,Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
58298,L336443,u1698,m112,ANDY,No shit!
58299,L336430,u1698,m112,ANDY,"I'm sorry, this is just too convenient."
58300,L336429,u1703,m112,FRANK,Take it easy.  Both of you.
58301,L336422,u1703,m112,FRANK,What was your relationship with her?
58302,L336421,u1698,m112,ANDY,We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
58303,L336388,u1703,m112,FRANK,"I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying."
58304,L336387,u1698,m112,ANDY,You think he's dirty?
58305,L336386,u1703,m112,FRANK,"He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi."
58306,L336385,u1698,m112,ANDY,What do you think?
58307,L336329,u1698,m112,ANDY,No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
58308,L336328,u1703,m112,FRANK,Local?
58309,L336327,u1698,m112,ANDY,Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
58310,L336326,u1703,m112,FRANK,Run it down.
58311,L336325,u1698,m112,ANDY,"Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank."
58312,L337093,u1706,m112,KATHY,You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
58313,L337092,u1698,m112,ANDY,We'll find the evidence.
58314,L337080,u1698,m112,ANDY,"Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased."
58315,L337079,u1706,m112,KATHY,"It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this."
58316,L337078,u1698,m112,ANDY,"Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!"
58317,L337077,u1706,m112,KATHY,Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
58318,L337048,u1706,m112,KATHY,He was with me?
58319,L337047,u1698,m112,ANDY,Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
58320,L336926,u1698,m112,ANDY,But a hundred men could move him.
58321,L336925,u1706,m112,KATHY,It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
58322,L336863,u1698,m112,ANDY,What was suspicious about him?
58323,L336862,u1706,m112,KATHY,Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
58324,L336861,u1698,m112,ANDY,Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
58325,L336860,u1706,m112,KATHY,"What do you mean, stand out?"
58326,L336859,u1698,m112,ANDY,Did anyone stand out?
58327,L336858,u1706,m112,KATHY,A few people.
58328,L336579,u1706,m112,KATHY,Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
58329,L336578,u1698,m112,ANDY,I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
58330,L336577,u1706,m112,KATHY,Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
58331,L336574,u1706,m112,KATHY,He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
58332,L336573,u1698,m112,ANDY,Why does he call Sanderson?
58333,L336556,u1706,m112,KATHY,You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
58334,L336555,u1698,m112,ANDY,"You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch."
58335,L337239,u1708,m112,PETER,You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
58336,L337238,u1699,m112,CALLER,How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
58337,L337235,u1708,m112,PETER,The pipes.
58338,L337234,u1699,m112,CALLER,Very good.  How did you know?
58339,L337233,u1708,m112,PETER,I know where you are.
58340,L337230,u1708,m112,PETER,No!  Wait!!
58341,L337229,u1699,m112,CALLER,I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
58342,L337228,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies."
58343,L337227,u1708,m112,PETER,I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
58344,L337226,u1699,m112,CALLER,You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
58345,L337225,u1708,m112,PETER,"That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  ""His play is always fair and just."""
58346,L337224,u1699,m112,CALLER,No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
58347,L337223,u1708,m112,PETER,It's me you want.  Not her.
58348,L337222,u1699,m112,CALLER,The game's over.  You lost.
58349,L337221,u1708,m112,PETER,Please... wait.
58350,L337220,u1699,m112,CALLER,She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
58351,L337219,u1708,m112,PETER,Let me speak to my daughter.
58352,L337218,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter."
58353,L337217,u1708,m112,PETER,Yes?
58354,L337176,u1699,m112,CALLER,"No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call."
58355,L337175,u1708,m112,PETER,I've figured out the message.
58356,L337174,u1699,m112,CALLER,By that time the game will be over.
58357,L337173,u1708,m112,PETER,If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
58358,L337172,u1699,m112,CALLER,Emotional?  I expected more from you.
58359,L337171,u1708,m112,PETER,You sonofabitch!
58360,L337170,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Hello, Peter."
58361,L337076,u1699,m112,CALLER,--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
58362,L337075,u1708,m112,PETER,I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
58363,L337074,u1699,m112,CALLER,Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
58364,L337073,u1708,m112,PETER,They think that you and I are doing this together.
58365,L337072,u1699,m112,CALLER,The police haven't told you?
58366,L337071,u1708,m112,PETER,What word did you leave last night?
58367,L337070,u1699,m112,CALLER,I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
58368,L337069,u1708,m112,PETER,You're next move should have been e2- e3.
58369,L337068,u1699,m112,CALLER,Very good.
58370,L337067,u1708,m112,PETER,You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
58371,L337066,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?"
58372,L337065,u1708,m112,PETER,Hello.
58373,L336909,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are."
58374,L336908,u1708,m112,PETER,"It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!"
58375,L336907,u1699,m112,CALLER,"The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time."
58376,L336906,u1708,m112,PETER,I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
58377,L336905,u1699,m112,CALLER,What makes you think I was there?
58378,L336904,u1708,m112,PETER,You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
58379,L336903,u1699,m112,CALLER,What?
58380,L336900,u1708,m112,PETER,"You like to brag, don't you?"
58381,L336899,u1699,m112,CALLER,I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
58382,L336898,u1708,m112,PETER,"If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?"
58383,L336897,u1699,m112,CALLER,Have you any idea what the message is?
58384,L336737,u1699,m112,CALLER,"So is mine, within the framework of my rules."
58385,L336736,u1708,m112,PETER,"Huxley's quote also says, ""his play is always fair and just."""
58386,L336735,u1699,m112,CALLER,I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
58387,L336734,u1708,m112,PETER,How?
58388,L336733,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game."
58389,L336732,u1708,m112,PETER,And you want these girls to feel your pain?
58390,L336731,u1699,m112,CALLER,Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
58391,L336730,u1708,m112,PETER,Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
58392,L336729,u1699,m112,CALLER,Just for that no hint today.
58393,L336726,u1708,m112,PETER,Then call them!
58394,L336725,u1699,m112,CALLER,I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
58395,L336723,u1699,m112,CALLER,You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
58396,L336722,u1708,m112,PETER,I'm just trying to play the game.
58397,L336721,u1699,m112,CALLER,"I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting."
58398,L336720,u1708,m112,PETER,Just like who?
58399,L336719,u1699,m112,CALLER,I know what I said!  She looks just like...
58400,L336718,u1708,m112,PETER,But you said you didn't know her.
58401,L336717,u1699,m112,CALLER,Because she's the type.
58402,L336716,u1708,m112,PETER,Why her?
58403,L336715,u1699,m112,CALLER,Not really.
58404,L336714,u1708,m112,PETER,You know her?
58405,L336713,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight."
58406,L336712,u1708,m112,PETER,Hello?
58407,L336547,u1699,m112,CALLER,"""Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."""
58408,L336546,u1708,m112,PETER,You're not going to tell me that.
58409,L336545,u1699,m112,CALLER,"I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?"
58410,L336542,u1708,m112,PETER,"If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!"
58411,L336541,u1699,m112,CALLER,You'll find her.
58412,L336540,u1708,m112,PETER,Where is she?
58413,L336539,u1699,m112,CALLER,"I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play."
58414,L336538,u1708,m112,PETER,What?
58415,L336537,u1699,m112,CALLER,You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
58416,L336536,u1708,m112,PETER,Why not?
58417,L336535,u1699,m112,CALLER,"That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions."
58418,L336534,u1708,m112,PETER,Why did you write remember on the wall?
58419,L336533,u1699,m112,CALLER,We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
58420,L336532,u1708,m112,PETER,And -- what path is that?
58421,L336531,u1699,m112,CALLER,"No, only the path she chose to travel."
58422,L336530,u1708,m112,PETER,Did you know her?
58423,L336529,u1699,m112,CALLER,To get your attention.
58424,L336528,u1708,m112,PETER,Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
58425,L336527,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?"
58426,L336526,u1708,m112,PETER,Just a second.  Hello?
58427,L336525,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Hello, Peter."
58428,L336412,u1708,m112,PETER,I haven't got time for this.
58429,L336411,u1699,m112,CALLER,Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
58430,L336410,u1708,m112,PETER,Who is this?
58431,L336409,u1699,m112,CALLER,"Hello, Peter."
58432,L337254,u1706,m112,KATHY,"I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David."
58433,L337253,u1700,m112,DAVID,Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
58434,L337252,u1706,m112,KATHY,"I know, but this isn't going to bring her back."
58435,L337251,u1700,m112,DAVID,They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
58436,L337250,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened."
58437,L337249,u1700,m112,DAVID,You don't understand.
58438,L337248,u1706,m112,KATHY,"This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it."
58439,L337243,u1700,m112,DAVID,The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
58440,L337242,u1708,m112,PETER,What scars?
58441,L337241,u1700,m112,DAVID,"You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours."
58442,L337240,u1708,m112,PETER,Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
58443,L336961,u1700,m112,DAVID,New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
58444,L336960,u1708,m112,PETER,What is it?
58445,L336959,u1708,m112,PETER,He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
58446,L336958,u1700,m112,DAVID,1985.  Hans Korshaud.
58447,L336957,u1708,m112,PETER,Never mind.  He died two years ago.
58448,L336956,u1700,m112,DAVID,There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
58449,L336955,u1708,m112,PETER,Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
58450,L336954,u1700,m112,DAVID,Now what?
58451,L336952,u1700,m112,DAVID,"Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games."
58452,L336951,u1708,m112,PETER,"D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years."
58453,L336948,u1708,m112,PETER,Set up some pieces on the big board?
58454,L336947,u1700,m112,DAVID,Nope.  Nothing.
58455,L336946,u1708,m112,PETER,Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
58456,L336945,u1700,m112,DAVID,No problem.  We're in.
58457,L336944,u1708,m112,PETER,"Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?"
58458,L336943,u1700,m112,DAVID,Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
58459,L336680,u1708,m112,PETER,Of course not.
58460,L336679,u1700,m112,DAVID,"Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind."
58461,L336678,u1708,m112,PETER,What's this?
58462,L336677,u1708,m112,PETER,Thanks.
58463,L336676,u1700,m112,DAVID,"Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster."
58464,L337189,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,You're losing me.
58465,L337188,u1706,m112,KATHY,Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
58466,L337187,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,He was watching you.
58467,L337186,u1706,m112,KATHY,Come here.
58468,L337185,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,Why did he what?
58469,L337184,u1706,m112,KATHY,Why did he?
58470,L337183,u1706,m112,KATHY,He already did once.
58471,L337182,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
58472,L337181,u1706,m112,KATHY,I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
58473,L337180,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,"Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet."
58474,L337151,u1706,m112,KATHY,"How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history."
58475,L337150,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
58476,L337149,u1706,m112,KATHY,I just can't believe it.
58477,L337148,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,Feeling better?
58478,L336509,u1706,m112,KATHY,Fuck off!
58479,L336508,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,"It worked out alright, didn't it?"
58480,L336507,u1706,m112,KATHY,Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
58481,L336506,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
58482,L336505,u1706,m112,KATHY,"--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath."
58483,L336504,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,"I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--"
58484,L336503,u1706,m112,KATHY,You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
58485,L336502,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
58486,L336501,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?"
58487,L336500,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
58488,L336499,u1706,m112,KATHY,You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
58489,L336498,u1701,m112,DOCTOR FULTON,You might not have done it had you known.
58490,L336893,u1706,m112,KATHY,Nice meeting you.
58491,L336892,u1702,m112,ERICA,Okay.  Nice meeting you.
58492,L336890,u1702,m112,ERICA,No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
58493,L336889,u1706,m112,KATHY,How do you know that?  Did he say something?
58494,L336888,u1702,m112,ERICA,I know he really likes you.
58495,L336886,u1706,m112,KATHY,Of course.
58496,L336885,u1702,m112,ERICA,Do you like my dad?
58497,L336884,u1702,m112,ERICA,Boys.
58498,L336883,u1706,m112,KATHY,That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
58499,L336882,u1702,m112,ERICA,Not really.  It's pretty boring.
58500,L336881,u1706,m112,KATHY,"So, are you having a good time on the Island?"
58501,L336880,u1702,m112,ERICA,He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
58502,L336879,u1706,m112,KATHY,Is your dad here?
58503,L336878,u1706,m112,KATHY,I'm Kathy.
58504,L336877,u1702,m112,ERICA,Uh huh.
58505,L336876,u1706,m112,KATHY,You must be Erica.
58506,L336849,u1702,m112,ERICA,Who's Kathy?
58507,L336848,u1708,m112,PETER,It isn't Kathy.
58508,L336689,u1702,m112,ERICA,But you promised.
58509,L336688,u1708,m112,PETER,"I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today."
58510,L336687,u1702,m112,ERICA,You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
58511,L336686,u1708,m112,PETER,For what?
58512,L336685,u1702,m112,ERICA,You ready?
58513,L336683,u1702,m112,ERICA,"Thanks, David."
58514,L336682,u1708,m112,PETER,Don't you have something you want to say to David?
58515,L336416,u1708,m112,PETER,Nothing.
58516,L336415,u1702,m112,ERICA,"What is it, dad?"
58517,L336406,u1702,m112,ERICA,"No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio."
58518,L336405,u1708,m112,PETER,Has he gotten through to any?
58519,L336404,u1702,m112,ERICA,Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
58520,L336403,u1708,m112,PETER,Who told you that?
58521,L336318,u1702,m112,ERICA,Okay.
58522,L336317,u1708,m112,PETER,You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
58523,L336316,u1702,m112,ERICA,That has nothing to do with it.
58524,L336315,u1708,m112,PETER,"I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?"
58525,L336314,u1702,m112,ERICA,I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
58526,L336313,u1708,m112,PETER,What are you doing up?
58527,L336304,u1708,m112,PETER,My cheering section.
58528,L336303,u1702,m112,ERICA,"Congratulations, dad."
58529,L336670,u1703,m112,FRANK,That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
58530,L336669,u1707,m112,NOLAN,I'd say at least eighteen hours.
58531,L336668,u1703,m112,FRANK,How long she been dead?
58532,L336667,u1707,m112,NOLAN,Yeah.
58533,L336666,u1703,m112,FRANK,Same as the others?
58534,L336659,u1707,m112,NOLAN,"Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?"
58535,L336658,u1703,m112,FRANK,That's great.
58536,L336657,u1707,m112,NOLAN,"This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope."
58537,L336564,u1707,m112,NOLAN,Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
58538,L336563,u1703,m112,FRANK,There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
58539,L336562,u1707,m112,NOLAN,"He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store."
58540,L336362,u1707,m112,NOLAN,No Frank.  No prints.
58541,L336361,u1703,m112,FRANK,"You mean, no prints but hers?"
58542,L336360,u1707,m112,NOLAN,No prints.
58543,L336359,u1703,m112,FRANK,What about prints?
58544,L336358,u1707,m112,NOLAN,"Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath."
58545,L336357,u1703,m112,FRANK,Anything?
58546,L336342,u1707,m112,NOLAN,Bingo.
58547,L336341,u1703,m112,FRANK,There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
58548,L336337,u1707,m112,NOLAN,Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
58549,L336336,u1703,m112,FRANK,Any sign of rape?
58550,L336335,u1707,m112,NOLAN,"Six, eight hours tops."
58551,L336334,u1703,m112,FRANK,How long has she been dead?
58552,L336333,u1707,m112,NOLAN,Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
58553,L336332,u1703,m112,FRANK,"Whaddaya got, Nolan?"
58554,L337128,u1703,m112,FRANK,Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
58555,L337127,u1706,m112,KATHY,I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
58556,L337126,u1703,m112,FRANK,I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
58557,L337125,u1706,m112,KATHY,No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
58558,L337124,u1703,m112,FRANK,Did you see his face?
58559,L337091,u1706,m112,KATHY,You don't have a shred of evidence!
58560,L337090,u1703,m112,FRANK,The most logical choice.
58561,L337089,u1706,m112,KATHY,This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
58562,L337088,u1703,m112,FRANK,We're going to work on the message.
58563,L337087,u1706,m112,KATHY,And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
58564,L337084,u1706,m112,KATHY,What does that mean?
58565,L337083,u1703,m112,FRANK,We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
58566,L337082,u1706,m112,KATHY,What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
58567,L337081,u1703,m112,FRANK,"He's right, Kathy."
58568,L337050,u1706,m112,KATHY,About a quarter to one.
58569,L337049,u1703,m112,FRANK,What time did he get there?
58570,L336985,u1703,m112,FRANK,Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
58571,L336984,u1706,m112,KATHY,As large as castles.
58572,L336971,u1703,m112,FRANK,That's a big area to cover.
58573,L336970,u1706,m112,KATHY,Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
58574,L336933,u1706,m112,KATHY,He moves around a lot.  Why?
58575,L336932,u1703,m112,FRANK,It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
58576,L336931,u1706,m112,KATHY,I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
58577,L336930,u1703,m112,FRANK,Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
58578,L336748,u1703,m112,FRANK,What did he mean by Huxley?
58579,L336747,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take."
58580,L336741,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake."
58581,L336740,u1703,m112,FRANK,You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
58582,L336665,u1703,m112,FRANK,This ain't no photo.
58583,L336664,u1706,m112,KATHY,I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
58584,L336663,u1703,m112,FRANK,Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
58585,L336619,u1703,m112,FRANK,Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
58586,L336618,u1706,m112,KATHY,His home would be... Mount Olympus.
58587,L336597,u1706,m112,KATHY,Meaning?
58588,L336596,u1703,m112,FRANK,"I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center."
58589,L336572,u1706,m112,KATHY,I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
58590,L336571,u1703,m112,FRANK,"I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?"
58591,L336570,u1706,m112,KATHY,Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
58592,L336569,u1703,m112,FRANK,Anything else?
58593,L336568,u1706,m112,KATHY,"That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around."
58594,L336567,u1703,m112,FRANK,What about the way he arranged the body?
58595,L336566,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim."
58596,L336565,u1703,m112,FRANK,Kathy?
58597,L336559,u1703,m112,FRANK,It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
58598,L336558,u1706,m112,KATHY,But we heard him.
58599,L336557,u1703,m112,FRANK,No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
58600,L336520,u1706,m112,KATHY,"--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?"
58601,L336519,u1703,m112,FRANK,And this Jeremy--
58602,L336518,u1706,m112,KATHY,I see you're still having problems with your openings.
58603,L336512,u1703,m112,FRANK,It's important.
58604,L336511,u1706,m112,KATHY,I'm busy right now.
58605,L336496,u1703,m112,FRANK,We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
58606,L336495,u1706,m112,KATHY,What do you think he did?
58607,L336494,u1703,m112,FRANK,We're not sure.
58608,L336493,u1706,m112,KATHY,Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
58609,L336492,u1703,m112,FRANK,What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
58610,L336491,u1706,m112,KATHY,"I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?"
58611,L336490,u1703,m112,FRANK,You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
58612,L336489,u1706,m112,KATHY,Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
58613,L336488,u1703,m112,FRANK,Well?
58614,L336869,u1703,m112,FRANK,Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
58615,L336868,u1704,m112,GIRL,Through a rental agency.
58616,L336867,u1703,m112,FRANK,Do you know how she found the apartment?
58617,L336866,u1704,m112,GIRL,Ten days ago.
58618,L336865,u1703,m112,FRANK,Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
58619,L336854,u1704,m112,GIRL,"You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be."
58620,L336853,u1703,m112,FRANK,If you can think of anything else give us a call.
58621,L337210,u1703,m112,FRANK,"It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car."
58622,L337209,u1708,m112,PETER,Did you send the car?
58623,L337206,u1708,m112,PETER,I signed the confession.  What about the car?
58624,L337205,u1703,m112,FRANK,"Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell."
58625,L337202,u1708,m112,PETER,"Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel."
58626,L337201,u1703,m112,FRANK,I understand that this is just another one of your games.
58627,L337200,u1708,m112,PETER,Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
58628,L337154,u1708,m112,PETER,This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
58629,L337153,u1703,m112,FRANK,Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
58630,L337152,u1708,m112,PETER,Jeremy would have never killed himself.
58631,L337046,u1708,m112,PETER,I went out.
58632,L337045,u1703,m112,FRANK,Answer the question.
58633,L337044,u1708,m112,PETER,Are we going to go through this again?
58634,L337043,u1703,m112,FRANK,Where were you last night?
58635,L336990,u1708,m112,PETER,That's got to be it.
58636,L336989,u1703,m112,FRANK,Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
58637,L336988,u1708,m112,PETER,"A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?"
58638,L336987,u1703,m112,FRANK,"He uses castles...plural --  then says ""can't move me.""  Singular.  Not can't move us."
58639,L336986,u1708,m112,PETER,He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
58640,L336983,u1708,m112,PETER,"A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?"
58641,L336982,u1703,m112,FRANK,A building?
58642,L336981,u1708,m112,PETER,"As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?"
58643,L336967,u1708,m112,PETER,But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
58644,L336966,u1703,m112,FRANK,It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
58645,L336950,u1708,m112,PETER,"That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4."
58646,L336949,u1703,m112,FRANK,I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
58647,L336941,u1708,m112,PETER,Maybe I already have.
58648,L336940,u1703,m112,FRANK,How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
58649,L336939,u1708,m112,PETER,He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
58650,L336924,u1703,m112,FRANK,It doesn't make sense.
58651,L336923,u1708,m112,PETER,"As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me."
58652,L336896,u1703,m112,FRANK,"""Is"".  Did you tell him about the institute?"
58653,L336895,u1708,m112,PETER,Another one?  What word did he leave?
58654,L336611,u1708,m112,PETER,Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
58655,L336610,u1703,m112,FRANK,We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
58656,L336609,u1708,m112,PETER,That's it?
58657,L336607,u1703,m112,FRANK,Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
58658,L336606,u1708,m112,PETER,"Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease."
58659,L336605,u1703,m112,FRANK,"""Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street.""  We think he might be making a reference to himself."
58660,L336604,u1708,m112,PETER,What have you come up with on the riddle?
58661,L336554,u1703,m112,FRANK,That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
58662,L336553,u1708,m112,PETER,You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
58663,L336517,u1708,m112,PETER,We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
58664,L336516,u1703,m112,FRANK,"Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out."
58665,L336420,u1708,m112,PETER,I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
58666,L336419,u1703,m112,FRANK,Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
58667,L336377,u1708,m112,PETER,I got it from the tournament directory.
58668,L336376,u1703,m112,FRANK,"What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number."
58669,L336375,u1708,m112,PETER,She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
58670,L336374,u1703,m112,FRANK,This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
58671,L336371,u1708,m112,PETER,To my room and then I went for a walk.
58672,L336370,u1703,m112,FRANK,I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
58673,L336369,u1708,m112,PETER,Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
58674,L336368,u1703,m112,FRANK,Could you tell me where you were last night?
58675,L336365,u1708,m112,PETER,Only in passing.  To say hello to.
58676,L336364,u1703,m112,FRANK,I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
58677,L337042,u1708,m112,PETER,Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
58678,L337041,u1705,m112,JEREMY,Feel like practicing?
58679,L337040,u1708,m112,PETER,No.
58680,L337039,u1705,m112,JEREMY,She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
58681,L336844,u1705,m112,JEREMY,Exactly... and you did this.
58682,L336843,u1708,m112,PETER,Mate in five.
58683,L336842,u1705,m112,JEREMY,What do you see here?
58684,L336841,u1708,m112,PETER,Who says something's on my mind.
58685,L336840,u1705,m112,JEREMY,Whatever's on your mind.
58686,L336839,u1708,m112,PETER,About what?
58687,L336838,u1705,m112,JEREMY,Just thought you might want to talk.
58688,L336837,u1708,m112,PETER,You have something you want to say?
58689,L336694,u1708,m112,PETER,I want to be the best I can.
58690,L336693,u1705,m112,JEREMY,You're always in the middle of a match.
58691,L336692,u1708,m112,PETER,I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
58692,L336691,u1705,m112,JEREMY,Peter...
58693,L336675,u1708,m112,PETER,Is it serious?
58694,L336674,u1705,m112,JEREMY,Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
58695,L336673,u1708,m112,PETER,We got a problem?
58696,L336312,u1705,m112,JEREMY,"You don't win by playing it safe, Peter."
58697,L336311,u1708,m112,PETER,"It's a good play, but risky."
58698,L336309,u1708,m112,PETER,I suppose you have something in mind?
58699,L336308,u1705,m112,JEREMY,"On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique."
58700,L336307,u1708,m112,PETER,Then I'll transpose.
58701,L336306,u1705,m112,JEREMY,He knows you're aware of that.
58702,L336305,u1708,m112,PETER,You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
58703,L337166,u1710,m112,WOMAN'S VOICE,"""Carefully"".  ""Carefully"". ""Carefully""."
58704,L337165,u1706,m112,KATHY,"What are they, please?"
58705,L337164,u1710,m112,WOMAN'S VOICE,"Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?"
58706,L337163,u1706,m112,KATHY,Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
58707,L337162,u1710,m112,WOMAN'S VOICE,"Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book."
58708,L337161,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book."
58709,L337160,u1710,m112,WOMAN'S VOICE,Bainbridge Books.
58710,L337118,u1710,m112,WOMAN'S VOICE,We'll call you back.
58711,L337117,u1706,m112,KATHY,Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
58712,L337116,u1710,m112,WOMAN'S VOICE,I can check and call you back.
58713,L337115,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called ""Principals and Tactics"" by Anton Berger."
58714,L337114,u1710,m112,WOMAN'S VOICE,Bainbridge Books.
58715,L337265,u1708,m112,PETER,Do we have a future?
58716,L337264,u1706,m112,KATHY,I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
58717,L337263,u1708,m112,PETER,It's over now.
58718,L337261,u1706,m112,KATHY,There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
58719,L337260,u1708,m112,PETER,I got lucky.
58720,L337259,u1706,m112,KATHY,You beat him.
58721,L337113,u1706,m112,KATHY,Yeah.  I'll be there later.
58722,L337112,u1708,m112,PETER,Are you going to come tonight?
58723,L337111,u1706,m112,KATHY,You're going to be late for your match.
58724,L337110,u1706,m112,KATHY,Of course not.
58725,L337109,u1708,m112,PETER,"This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?"
58726,L337107,u1706,m112,KATHY,He didn't tell you either.
58727,L337106,u1708,m112,PETER,You're right.  The killer told me.
58728,L337105,u1706,m112,KATHY,No he didn't.
58729,L337104,u1708,m112,PETER,Frank told me.
58730,L337103,u1706,m112,KATHY,"How did you know it was ""carefully""?"
58731,L337100,u1708,m112,PETER,It's got to be grammatically correct.
58732,L337099,u1706,m112,KATHY,It could be anything.
58733,L337098,u1708,m112,PETER,If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
58734,L337031,u1706,m112,KATHY,Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
58735,L337030,u1708,m112,PETER,Because I know what it says.
58736,L337029,u1706,m112,KATHY,Why not?
58737,L337028,u1708,m112,PETER,This letter.  I've never opened it.
58738,L337027,u1708,m112,PETER,Because she killed herself!!
58739,L337026,u1706,m112,KATHY,Why?
58740,L337025,u1708,m112,PETER,But I do.
58741,L337024,u1706,m112,KATHY,Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
58742,L337023,u1708,m112,PETER,It's not that easy.
58743,L337022,u1706,m112,KATHY,Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
58744,L337021,u1708,m112,PETER,You don't understand.
58745,L337020,u1706,m112,KATHY,You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
58746,L337019,u1708,m112,PETER,"I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them."
58747,L337018,u1706,m112,KATHY,That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
58748,L337017,u1708,m112,PETER,"No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now."
58749,L337016,u1706,m112,KATHY,Peter...
58750,L337015,u1708,m112,PETER,You really haven't seen my best side.
58751,L337014,u1706,m112,KATHY,I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
58752,L337013,u1708,m112,PETER,I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
58753,L337012,u1706,m112,KATHY,"I'm not looking for an apology, Peter."
58754,L337011,u1708,m112,PETER,"The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did."
58755,L337010,u1708,m112,PETER,Can I come in?
58756,L337009,u1706,m112,KATHY,Hi.
58757,L336965,u1708,m112,PETER,Right.  Here!  c-4.
58758,L336964,u1706,m112,KATHY,Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
58759,L336963,u1708,m112,PETER,"He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?"
58760,L336917,u1708,m112,PETER,Where's the note?
58761,L336916,u1706,m112,KATHY,What?
58762,L336915,u1708,m112,PETER,A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
58763,L336914,u1706,m112,KATHY,But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
58764,L336913,u1708,m112,PETER,Exactly.  It's the key.
58765,L336912,u1706,m112,KATHY,For emphasis?
58766,L336911,u1708,m112,PETER,In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
58767,L336813,u1708,m112,PETER,"How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?"
58768,L336812,u1706,m112,KATHY,Peter...
58769,L336811,u1708,m112,PETER,--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
58770,L336810,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Peter, you have to admit--"
58771,L336806,u1708,m112,PETER,Then why are you backing up?
58772,L336805,u1706,m112,KATHY,Nothing.
58773,L336804,u1708,m112,PETER,What's wrong?
58774,L336803,u1706,m112,KATHY,I tried again and got through.
58775,L336802,u1708,m112,PETER,I thought you said the line was busy?
58776,L336801,u1706,m112,KATHY,They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
58777,L336799,u1706,m112,KATHY,The line was busy.  I'll try again.
58778,L336798,u1708,m112,PETER,Did you call?
58779,L336797,u1708,m112,PETER,If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
58780,L336796,u1706,m112,KATHY,Would you settle for pepperoni?
58781,L336795,u1708,m112,PETER,You.
58782,L336794,u1706,m112,KATHY,What do you want on it?
58783,L336793,u1708,m112,PETER,Fine.
58784,L336791,u1708,m112,PETER,Call room service.
58785,L336790,u1706,m112,KATHY,I'm hungry.
58786,L336789,u1708,m112,PETER,No.
58787,L336788,u1706,m112,KATHY,"You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?"
58788,L336786,u1706,m112,KATHY,I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
58789,L336785,u1708,m112,PETER,I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
58790,L336784,u1706,m112,KATHY,You've got to face the things you feel.
58791,L336783,u1708,m112,PETER,This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
58792,L336782,u1706,m112,KATHY,Then show me who you are.
58793,L336781,u1708,m112,PETER,I just don't want to fight with you.
58794,L336779,u1706,m112,KATHY,Does anyone?
58795,L336778,u1708,m112,PETER,What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
58796,L336777,u1706,m112,KATHY,Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
58797,L336776,u1708,m112,PETER,What?  By attacking me?
58798,L336775,u1706,m112,KATHY,"I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter."
58799,L336774,u1708,m112,PETER,What is this?
58800,L336773,u1706,m112,KATHY,Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
58801,L336772,u1708,m112,PETER,I'm not playing a game now.
58802,L336771,u1706,m112,KATHY,Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
58803,L336770,u1708,m112,PETER,What?
58804,L336766,u1706,m112,KATHY,And you?
58805,L336765,u1708,m112,PETER,It was.
58806,L336764,u1706,m112,KATHY,It must've been very hard on Erica?
58807,L336763,u1708,m112,PETER,It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
58808,L336762,u1706,m112,KATHY,I'm sorry.
58809,L336761,u1708,m112,PETER,She died in a car accident.
58810,L336760,u1706,m112,KATHY,I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
58811,L336759,u1708,m112,PETER,Alright.  What about me?
58812,L336758,u1706,m112,KATHY,No.  You were talking about chess.
58813,L336757,u1708,m112,PETER,Wasn't I just talking about me?
58814,L336756,u1706,m112,KATHY,You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
58815,L336755,u1708,m112,PETER,"You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to."
58816,L336754,u1706,m112,KATHY,I'm sure you are.
58817,L336753,u1708,m112,PETER,No.  But I'm open to distractions.
58818,L336752,u1706,m112,KATHY,Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
58819,L336707,u1706,m112,KATHY,Because I think he's wrong.
58820,L336706,u1708,m112,PETER,Why?
58821,L336705,u1706,m112,KATHY,No.
58822,L336704,u1708,m112,PETER,Doesn't that scare you?
58823,L336703,u1706,m112,KATHY,"You know, Andy thinks you're doing this."
58824,L336702,u1708,m112,PETER,I know you didn't
58825,L336700,u1706,m112,KATHY,How could you?  Unless you were there.
58826,L336699,u1708,m112,PETER,I know it was bad.
58827,L336698,u1706,m112,KATHY,How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
58828,L336697,u1708,m112,PETER,Relax.
58829,L336656,u1706,m112,KATHY,No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
58830,L336655,u1708,m112,PETER,You're not?
58831,L336654,u1706,m112,KATHY,No.
58832,L336652,u1706,m112,KATHY,Because I work with them.
58833,L336651,u1708,m112,PETER,Why?
58834,L336650,u1706,m112,KATHY,Of course.
58835,L336649,u1708,m112,PETER,I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
58836,L336648,u1706,m112,KATHY,"You have to win every point, don't you?"
58837,L336647,u1708,m112,PETER,"Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?"
58838,L336646,u1706,m112,KATHY,You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
58839,L336645,u1708,m112,PETER,Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
58840,L336644,u1706,m112,KATHY,That's not fair!
58841,L336643,u1708,m112,PETER,You mean like in the steam room?
58842,L336642,u1706,m112,KATHY,I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
58843,L336641,u1708,m112,PETER,I'm just curious.
58844,L336639,u1708,m112,PETER,"Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?"
58845,L336638,u1706,m112,KATHY,Let's change the subject.
58846,L336637,u1708,m112,PETER,Do you?
58847,L336636,u1706,m112,KATHY,Of course.
58848,L336635,u1708,m112,PETER,What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
58849,L336634,u1706,m112,KATHY,That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
58850,L336633,u1708,m112,PETER,Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
58851,L336632,u1706,m112,KATHY,How can you look at it so clinically?
58852,L336631,u1708,m112,PETER,"Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives."
58853,L336630,u1706,m112,KATHY,This isn't a game.
58854,L336629,u1708,m112,PETER,In a way.
58855,L336628,u1706,m112,KATHY,Another kind of game?
58856,L336627,u1708,m112,PETER,I think it's interesting.
58857,L336626,u1706,m112,KATHY,Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
58858,L336625,u1708,m112,PETER,It wasn't intentional.
58859,L336624,u1706,m112,KATHY,You sound like my mother.
58860,L336623,u1708,m112,PETER,It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
58861,L336622,u1706,m112,KATHY,I don't think I could.
58862,L336621,u1708,m112,PETER,You sure you don't want to eat something?
58863,L336590,u1706,m112,KATHY,What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
58864,L336589,u1708,m112,PETER,She could be dead now.
58865,L336588,u1706,m112,KATHY,She could be dead after the game.
58866,L336587,u1708,m112,PETER,I can't right now.  I've got a game.
58867,L336586,u1706,m112,KATHY,But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
58868,L336585,u1708,m112,PETER,I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
58869,L336584,u1706,m112,KATHY,We need your help.
58870,L336583,u1708,m112,PETER,Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
58871,L336582,u1706,m112,KATHY,They couldn't break the riddle.
58872,L336486,u1708,m112,PETER,No you didn't.
58873,L336485,u1706,m112,KATHY,Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
58874,L336484,u1708,m112,PETER,What are you looking for?
58875,L336483,u1708,m112,PETER,Getting too hot in here for you?
58876,L336482,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Well, I think I've had enough."
58877,L336481,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian."
58878,L336480,u1708,m112,PETER,Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
58879,L336479,u1706,m112,KATHY,You.
58880,L336478,u1708,m112,PETER,"Are we talking about me, or chess?"
58881,L336477,u1706,m112,KATHY,Do you always open quickly?
58882,L336476,u1708,m112,PETER,It is.
58883,L336475,u1706,m112,KATHY,I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
58884,L336474,u1708,m112,PETER,I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
58885,L336473,u1706,m112,KATHY,Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
58886,L336472,u1708,m112,PETER,I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
58887,L336471,u1706,m112,KATHY,That's a very personal question.
58888,L336470,u1708,m112,PETER,"If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?"
58889,L336469,u1706,m112,KATHY,--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
58890,L336468,u1708,m112,PETER,Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
58891,L336467,u1706,m112,KATHY,Sounds very violent.
58892,L336466,u1708,m112,PETER,Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
58893,L336465,u1706,m112,KATHY,It seems like such a complicated game.
58894,L336464,u1708,m112,PETER,When I was very young.
58895,L336463,u1706,m112,KATHY,I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
58896,L336462,u1708,m112,PETER,Yes.
58897,L336461,u1706,m112,KATHY,Are you one of the players?
58898,L336460,u1708,m112,PETER,Uh huh.
58899,L336459,u1706,m112,KATHY,Are you with the tournament?
58900,L336458,u1708,m112,PETER,No.  I don't.
58901,L336457,u1706,m112,KATHY,"Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?"
58902,L336456,u1708,m112,PETER,How come you don't stay with them?
58903,L336455,u1706,m112,KATHY,I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
58904,L336454,u1708,m112,PETER,Yes.
58905,L336453,u1706,m112,KATHY,Is this your first time here?
58906,L336452,u1706,m112,KATHY,It's alright.
58907,L336451,u1708,m112,PETER,Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
58908,L336402,u1711,m112,YURILIVICH,"Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?"
58909,L336401,u1708,m112,PETER,"Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win."
58910,L336400,u1711,m112,YURILIVICH,I'm not nervous.
58911,L336399,u1708,m112,PETER,"You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?"
58912,L336398,u1711,m112,YURILIVICH,"No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better."
58913,L336397,u1708,m112,PETER,I'm sure you are.
58914,L336396,u1711,m112,YURILIVICH,"Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you."
58915,L338835,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Yes.
58916,L338834,u1715,m113,LYSSA,That's a better one.
58917,L338820,u1715,m113,LYSSA,That way. I can feel the cold.
58918,L338819,u1712,m113,COLWYN,In the Arctic ice.
58919,L338791,u1715,m113,LYSSA,"Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast."
58920,L338790,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Lyssa ...
58921,L338787,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I knew you would come.
58922,L338786,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
58923,L338785,u1715,m113,LYSSA,Yes.
58924,L338782,u1715,m113,LYSSA,All directions are the same here.
58925,L338781,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Take the western passage.
58926,L338778,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
58927,L338777,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I don't know how.
58928,L338776,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Will your power outward.
58929,L338772,u1715,m113,LYSSA,All the passages are guarded.
58930,L338771,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You must move away from the Center.
58931,L338770,u1715,m113,LYSSA,Colwyn ...
58932,L338385,u1715,m113,LYSSA,"Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn."
58933,L338384,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"I love you, Lyssa, I love you ..."
58934,L338383,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I know it.
58935,L338382,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I will find you. I will be with you.
58936,L338381,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
58937,L338380,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Where is the Fortress?
58938,L338379,u1715,m113,LYSSA,Colwyn ...
58939,L338378,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Lyssa ...
58940,L338281,u1715,m113,LYSSA,In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
58941,L338280,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
58942,L338278,u1715,m113,LYSSA,"No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me."
58943,L338277,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Have they harmed you?
58944,L338276,u1715,m113,LYSSA,Colwyn.
58945,L338275,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
58946,L338216,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I can't wait either.
58947,L338215,u1715,m113,LYSSA,About what?
58948,L338214,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I lied.
58949,L338213,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I can't.
58950,L338212,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Thank you, but I can wait."
58951,L338211,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
58952,L338210,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
58953,L338209,u1715,m113,LYSSA,There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
58954,L338204,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Never mind my ears! Go away!
58955,L338203,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
58956,L338188,u1715,m113,LYSSA,"Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you."
58957,L338187,u1712,m113,COLWYN,We're not married <u>yet</u>.
58958,L338186,u1715,m113,LYSSA,We're almost married.
58959,L338185,u1712,m113,COLWYN,<u>What</u>?
58960,L338184,u1715,m113,LYSSA,Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
58961,L338183,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I have no intention of getting used to it.
58962,L338182,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it."
58963,L338181,u1715,m113,LYSSA,"You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses."
58964,L338180,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Well, you're beautiful."
58965,L338179,u1715,m113,LYSSA,You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
58966,L338178,u1712,m113,COLWYN,That's worse.
58967,L338177,u1715,m113,LYSSA,Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
58968,L338176,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin."
58969,L338175,u1715,m113,LYSSA,Me too.
58970,L338174,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
58971,L338173,u1715,m113,LYSSA,You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
58972,L338172,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I don't have to go through with it either.
58973,L338171,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
58974,L338236,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa."
58975,L338235,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
58976,L338234,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one."
58977,L338233,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I won't leave you here.
58978,L338232,u1721,m113,TUROLD,You will go alone.
58979,L338230,u1721,m113,TUROLD,You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
58980,L338229,u1712,m113,COLWYN,They have Lyssa!
58981,L338219,u1721,m113,TUROLD,Of course it was.
58982,L338218,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"It was a platonic kiss, Father."
58983,L338217,u1721,m113,TUROLD,You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
58984,L338804,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I forbid you!
58985,L338803,u1725,m113,YNYR,I can. Because I choose it.
58986,L338802,u1712,m113,COLWYN,No! You cannot know that!
58987,L338801,u1725,m113,YNYR,It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
58988,L338800,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You're coming with us.
58989,L338799,u1725,m113,YNYR,You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
58990,L338798,u1725,m113,YNYR,Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
58991,L338797,u1712,m113,COLWYN,What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
58992,L338796,u1725,m113,YNYR,Use your sword.
58993,L338795,u1712,m113,COLWYN,She can see the Beast!
58994,L338794,u1725,m113,YNYR,I chose the wrong passage.
58995,L338793,u1712,m113,COLWYN,She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
58996,L338784,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Where the spiral begins.
58997,L338783,u1725,m113,YNYR,The spiral begins in the west.
58998,L338774,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them."
58999,L338773,u1725,m113,YNYR,She must make a glaive.
59000,L338768,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her."
59001,L338767,u1712,m113,COLWYN,The Beast will kill her.
59002,L338766,u1725,m113,YNYR,"They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ..."
59003,L338721,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Let us wish him peace.
59004,L338720,u1725,m113,YNYR,"He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful."
59005,L338560,u1725,m113,YNYR,"You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance."
59006,L338559,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You will tell me her name and we will go together.
59007,L338558,u1725,m113,YNYR,"From here, I must go alone."
59008,L338551,u1725,m113,YNYR,He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
59009,L338550,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!"
59010,L338548,u1725,m113,YNYR,He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
59011,L338547,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
59012,L338525,u1725,m113,YNYR,Yes.
59013,L338524,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
59014,L338523,u1725,m113,YNYR,"You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting."
59015,L338522,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Never.
59016,L338521,u1725,m113,YNYR,No. She must agree of her own free will.
59017,L338520,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Can she be forced?
59018,L338519,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen."
59019,L338518,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
59020,L338517,u1725,m113,YNYR,He has come for Lyssa.
59021,L338516,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Yes.
59022,L338515,u1725,m113,YNYR,There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
59023,L338514,u1712,m113,COLWYN,No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
59024,L338458,u1725,m113,YNYR,"You will know, in good time."
59025,L338457,u1712,m113,COLWYN,But you suspect.
59026,L338456,u1725,m113,YNYR,I'm not sure.
59027,L338455,u1712,m113,COLWYN,<u>Why</u>?
59028,L338454,u1725,m113,YNYR,"No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks."
59029,L338453,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?"
59030,L338450,u1725,m113,YNYR,"She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast."
59031,L338449,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I cannot reach her.
59032,L338390,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I will find her!
59033,L338389,u1725,m113,YNYR,"The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all."
59034,L338388,u1712,m113,COLWYN,She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
59035,L338387,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below."
59036,L338386,u1712,m113,COLWYN,She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
59037,L338377,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
59038,L338376,u1725,m113,YNYR,What do you see?
59039,L338375,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I can't reach her.
59040,L338367,u1725,m113,YNYR,Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
59041,L338366,u1712,m113,COLWYN,They know when they're going to die?
59042,L338325,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
59043,L338324,u1725,m113,YNYR,You choose these?
59044,L338294,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Nor will I, till my bride is beside me."
59045,L338293,u1725,m113,YNYR,You have not slept in two days.
59046,L338292,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us."
59047,L338291,u1725,m113,YNYR,"No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us."
59048,L338290,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us."
59049,L338289,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice."
59050,L338288,u1712,m113,COLWYN,The Fortress moves?
59051,L338287,u1725,m113,YNYR,"It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs."
59052,L338286,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?"
59053,L338285,u1725,m113,YNYR,"You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?"
59054,L338274,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
59055,L338273,u1725,m113,YNYR,Reach out farther. Call to her.
59056,L338272,u1712,m113,COLWYN,There is nothing.
59057,L338269,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You won't have to.
59058,L338268,u1725,m113,YNYR,I am too old to climb down a rope.
59059,L338267,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You have rope?
59060,L338266,u1725,m113,YNYR,But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
59061,L338264,u1712,m113,COLWYN,But there is another entrance to this place.
59062,L338263,u1725,m113,YNYR,There is no other way.
59063,L338262,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
59064,L338261,u1725,m113,YNYR,"With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here."
59065,L338259,u1712,m113,COLWYN,In the old books. It's called a glaive.
59066,L338258,u1725,m113,YNYR,Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
59067,L338257,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I have no extraordinary powers.
59068,L338256,u1725,m113,YNYR,"This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours."
59069,L338254,u1725,m113,YNYR,"I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come."
59070,L338253,u1712,m113,COLWYN,We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
59071,L338252,u1725,m113,YNYR,Turold's son was to marry her.
59072,L338251,u1712,m113,COLWYN,The new Queen lives.
59073,L338250,u1725,m113,YNYR,Does the Queen live?
59074,L338249,u1712,m113,COLWYN,The White Castle has fallen.
59075,L338719,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,Each to his fate.
59076,L338718,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Each to his fate.
59077,L338714,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,Yes. It is today.
59078,L338713,u1712,m113,COLWYN,It is today?
59079,L338705,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Saddles.
59080,L338704,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,I road them often in my youth.
59081,L338703,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You have done it?
59082,L338702,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,They can be saddled.
59083,L338542,u1712,m113,COLWYN,What will happen?
59084,L338541,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,Do not let the waters touch you.
59085,L338537,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,We must enter the swamp.
59086,L338536,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Slayers!
59087,L338501,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
59088,L338500,u1712,m113,COLWYN,How did you know?
59089,L338689,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I cannot.
59090,L338688,u1722,m113,VELLA,"You will not, then?"
59091,L338687,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her."
59092,L338686,u1722,m113,VELLA,"One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price."
59093,L338685,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I cannot betray my bride.
59094,L338684,u1722,m113,VELLA,Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
59095,L338683,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I cannot take comfort when she has none.
59096,L338682,u1722,m113,VELLA,Let me comfort you.
59097,L338681,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I ache with it.
59098,L338680,u1722,m113,VELLA,You too are lonely.
59099,L338668,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Yes.
59100,L338667,u1722,m113,VELLA,Even by you?
59101,L338666,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Yes.
59102,L338665,u1722,m113,VELLA,Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
59103,L338664,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Yes.
59104,L338663,u1722,m113,VELLA,Am I not worth returning to?
59105,L338662,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I don't think that.
59106,L338661,u1722,m113,VELLA,Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
59107,L338660,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I know the cruelty of such a fate.
59108,L338576,u1714,m113,ERGO,What else is left for a man without friends.
59109,L338575,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You and I will guard the fire.
59110,L338574,u1714,m113,ERGO,Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
59111,L338411,u1714,m113,ERGO,<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
59112,L338410,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying."
59113,L338408,u1714,m113,ERGO,"No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men."
59114,L338407,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I have need of friends.
59115,L338406,u1714,m113,ERGO,My <u>friend</u>.
59116,L338405,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I was hoping I might be your friend.
59117,L338404,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ..."
59118,L338371,u1712,m113,COLWYN,He saved our lives.
59119,L338370,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Once is enough, thank you."
59120,L338309,u1714,m113,ERGO,Staying alive.
59121,L338308,u1712,m113,COLWYN,What business?
59122,L338307,u1714,m113,ERGO,I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
59123,L338302,u1714,m113,ERGO,"For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now."
59124,L338301,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Perhaps he expected to eat it.
59125,L338300,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?"
59126,L338299,u1712,m113,COLWYN,A forest near the Valley of Needles.
59127,L338298,u1714,m113,ERGO,It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
59128,L338297,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
59129,L338296,u1714,m113,ERGO,Help! Help! I'm drowning!
59130,L338824,u1712,m113,COLWYN,There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
59131,L338823,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing."
59132,L338822,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
59133,L338744,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Perhaps. If the pay is good.
59134,L338743,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord."
59135,L338742,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories."
59136,L338741,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Naturally.
59137,L338740,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Subject to the King, no doubt."
59138,L338739,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves."
59139,L338723,u1712,m113,COLWYN,At the gallop!
59140,L338722,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
59141,L338701,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
59142,L338700,u1712,m113,COLWYN,We could reach it on fire-mares.
59143,L338573,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Yes, my lord."
59144,L338572,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Go. I command you.
59145,L338571,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?"
59146,L338570,u1712,m113,COLWYN,The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
59147,L338569,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,What kind of friend do you think I am?
59148,L338568,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Go, join them."
59149,L338557,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain."
59150,L338556,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things."
59151,L338484,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,A flicker of talent.
59152,L338483,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Hand over your dinner.
59153,L338482,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination."
59154,L338481,u1712,m113,COLWYN,These we'll pay for.
59155,L338480,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
59156,L338479,u1712,m113,COLWYN,We must try to get horses.
59157,L338478,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,You've eaten nothing.
59158,L338416,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
59159,L338415,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Well, I'm not impressed."
59160,L338394,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves."
59161,L338393,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
59162,L338352,u1712,m113,COLWYN,No.
59163,L338351,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Not sleepy, either?"
59164,L338350,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I'm not hungry.
59165,L338347,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
59166,L338346,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
59167,L338345,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I'm all right.
59168,L338344,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"When did you last sleep, boy?"
59169,L338334,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
59170,L338333,u1712,m113,COLWYN,That I promise you.
59171,L338332,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"It should be an interesting journey, then."
59172,L338331,u1712,m113,COLWYN,To the place where Death lives.
59173,L338330,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"And where do you lead, boy?"
59174,L338329,u1712,m113,COLWYN,"So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons."
59175,L338328,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you."
59176,L338327,u1712,m113,COLWYN,You will follow me.
59177,L338326,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all."
59178,L338323,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I know you.
59179,L338322,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Hah! You don't know me, boy."
59180,L338321,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
59181,L338320,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,How did you know I had sons?
59182,L338319,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Fame is what you leave to your sons.
59183,L338318,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun."
59184,L338317,u1712,m113,COLWYN,Fame.
59185,L338316,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
59186,L338315,u1712,m113,COLWYN,I don't think you'll grow careless.
59187,L338716,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,And mine goes with you.
59188,L338715,u1714,m113,ERGO,My heart stays here.
59189,L338712,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,"I cannot go with you, my friend."
59190,L338711,u1714,m113,ERGO,Quell?
59191,L338632,u1714,m113,ERGO,"And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination."
59192,L338631,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,A small house.
59193,L338630,u1714,m113,ERGO,A venison pie as big as a house.
59194,L338566,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,No.
59195,L338565,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Can't I come, too?"
59196,L338564,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,We'll meet you at the inn.
59197,L338563,u1714,m113,ERGO,Where are you going?
59198,L338535,u1714,m113,ERGO,I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
59199,L338534,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
59200,L338533,u1714,m113,ERGO,What is that awful looking place?
59201,L338467,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,I am Quell.
59202,L338466,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera."
59203,L338465,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
59204,L338464,u1714,m113,ERGO,You!
59205,L338463,u1714,m113,ERGO,"A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar."
59206,L338462,u1713,m113,CYCLOPS,Would you settle for a boar?
59207,L338461,u1714,m113,ERGO,Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
59208,L338758,u1714,m113,ERGO,"No, no. I'm with you, boy."
59209,L338757,u1719,m113,TITCH,Would you desert your friends?
59210,L338756,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>."
59211,L338634,u1714,m113,ERGO,And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
59212,L338633,u1719,m113,TITCH,We meant only to please you.
59213,L338629,u1719,m113,TITCH,It's right behind you.
59214,L338628,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything."
59215,L338627,u1719,m113,TITCH,I don't think it's working.
59216,L338626,u1714,m113,ERGO,What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
59217,L338625,u1714,m113,ERGO,"First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend."
59218,L338624,u1719,m113,TITCH,Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
59219,L338490,u1714,m113,ERGO,"A foolish wish. And you, Quell?"
59220,L338489,u1719,m113,TITCH,I only want one.
59221,L338488,u1714,m113,ERGO,One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
59222,L338487,u1719,m113,TITCH,I'd wish for a puppy.
59223,L338486,u1714,m113,ERGO,"If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house."
59224,L338469,u1714,m113,ERGO,Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
59225,L338468,u1719,m113,TITCH,I'm hungry.
59226,L338448,u1719,m113,TITCH,I ...  ... am Titch.
59227,L338447,u1714,m113,ERGO,I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
59228,L338446,u1719,m113,TITCH,You can have half.
59229,L338445,u1714,m113,ERGO,You do?
59230,L338444,u1719,m113,TITCH,I have a cinnamon bar.
59231,L338443,u1714,m113,ERGO,What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
59232,L338442,u1719,m113,TITCH,No.
59233,L338441,u1714,m113,ERGO,Sugarballs?
59234,L338440,u1719,m113,TITCH,No.
59235,L338439,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?"
59236,L338637,u1714,m113,ERGO,No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
59237,L338636,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Look at its insides.
59238,L338635,u1714,m113,ERGO,Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
59239,L338554,u1714,m113,ERGO,Hush!
59240,L338553,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,I can't hold the weight of both of you!
59241,L338477,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence."
59242,L338476,u1714,m113,ERGO,"The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent."
59243,L338475,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Passable, pimple, very passable."
59244,L338374,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Oh, my poor stomach."
59245,L338373,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Oh, my poor stew!"
59246,L338361,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
59247,L338360,u1714,m113,ERGO,I am being exploited! Where are you going?
59248,L338359,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
59249,L338358,u1714,m113,ERGO,Food for crows.
59250,L338357,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,We have plenty of hares.
59251,L338356,u1714,m113,ERGO,And do you think I live on air?
59252,L338355,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
59253,L338354,u1714,m113,ERGO,What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
59254,L338342,u1714,m113,ERGO,"I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers."
59255,L338341,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,You had better manners as a pig.
59256,L338340,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Put me down, you lout!"
59257,L338312,u1714,m113,ERGO,Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
59258,L338311,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy."
59259,L338710,u1725,m113,YNYR,No. He will master the leader.
59260,L338709,u1714,m113,ERGO,They'll trample him to death!
59261,L338403,u1714,m113,ERGO,"Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it."
59262,L338402,u1725,m113,YNYR,He is the King.
59263,L338401,u1714,m113,ERGO,And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
59264,L338400,u1725,m113,YNYR,He didn't join them. They joined him.
59265,L338365,u1725,m113,YNYR,"If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death."
59266,L338364,u1714,m113,ERGO,He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
59267,L338363,u1725,m113,YNYR,"The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill."
59268,L338362,u1714,m113,ERGO,"One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me."
59269,L338306,u1714,m113,ERGO,<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
59270,L338305,u1725,m113,YNYR,The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
59271,L338304,u1714,m113,ERGO,My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
59272,L338697,u1723,m113,VOICE OF THE BEAST,He will not come. You will be my queen.
59273,L338696,u1715,m113,LYSSA,He will come for me.
59274,L338679,u1723,m113,VOICE OF THE BEAST,Then he will die!
59275,L338678,u1715,m113,LYSSA,He will not!
59276,L338677,u1723,m113,VOICE OF THE BEAST,These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
59277,L338676,u1715,m113,LYSSA,It's a lie!
59278,L338675,u1723,m113,VOICE OF THE BEAST,Then look!
59279,L338674,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
59280,L338653,u1723,m113,VOICE OF THE BEAST,"You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these."
59281,L338652,u1715,m113,LYSSA,I do not want your power. It is hideous.
59282,L338208,u1716,m113,QUEEN,They will have the life that you and I might have had.
59283,L338207,u1721,m113,TUROLD,A fine match.
59284,L338206,u1716,m113,QUEEN,"A match for your son, I think."
59285,L338205,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"A girl of some spirit, your daughter."
59286,L338200,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"That I am, my lady."
59287,L338199,u1716,m113,QUEEN,You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
59288,L338198,u1721,m113,TUROLD,I knew.
59289,L338197,u1716,m113,QUEEN,"I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise."
59290,L338196,u1716,m113,QUEEN,Yes.
59291,L338195,u1721,m113,TUROLD,It is important to assure the succession.
59292,L338194,u1716,m113,QUEEN,"For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise."
59293,L338191,u1721,m113,TUROLD,Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
59294,L338190,u1716,m113,QUEEN,Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
59295,L338166,u1721,m113,TUROLD,We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
59296,L338165,u1716,m113,QUEEN,"It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power."
59297,L338164,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers."
59298,L338163,u1716,m113,QUEEN,It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
59299,L338162,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered."
59300,L338161,u1716,m113,QUEEN,Freylag's stronghold?
59301,L338160,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen."
59302,L338159,u1716,m113,QUEEN,What news from our friends?
59303,L338193,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner."
59304,L338192,u1717,m113,ROWAN,Modred! Impossible!
59305,L338151,u1721,m113,TUROLD,"We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win."
59306,L338150,u1717,m113,ROWAN,"Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back."
59307,L338149,u1721,m113,TUROLD,How many did you lose?
59308,L338148,u1717,m113,ROWAN,"I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in."
59309,L338147,u1717,m113,ROWAN,You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
59310,L338146,u1721,m113,TUROLD,Yes. We lost five.
59311,L338145,u1717,m113,ROWAN,You were attacked in the forest?
59312,L338438,u1718,m113,SEER,"They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle."
59313,L338437,u1725,m113,YNYR,The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
59314,L338429,u1725,m113,YNYR,Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
59315,L338428,u1718,m113,SEER,Can you see?
59316,L338427,u1718,m113,SEER,I will seek the Fortress for you.
59317,L338426,u1725,m113,YNYR,It is the time.
59318,L338425,u1718,m113,SEER,"Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then."
59319,L338424,u1725,m113,YNYR,You know the voice.
59320,L338423,u1718,m113,SEER,With an old voice?
59321,L338422,u1725,m113,YNYR,The new King.
59322,L338421,u1718,m113,SEER,Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
59323,L338420,u1725,m113,YNYR,We seek the Fortress of Krull.
59324,L338808,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,That is true.
59325,L338807,u1725,m113,YNYR,Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
59326,L338764,u1725,m113,YNYR,It is too late. He has drunk.
59327,L338763,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Kegan!
59328,L338736,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much."
59329,L338735,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Look.
59330,L338734,u1725,m113,YNYR,It is not necessary. They will not follow.
59331,L338733,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
59332,L338699,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,It's a hundred leagues from here.
59333,L338698,u1725,m113,YNYR,We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
59334,L338562,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me."
59335,L338561,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"Each to his fate, lad."
59336,L338539,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Fewer will survive them.
59337,L338538,u1725,m113,YNYR,Few have survived it.
59338,L338513,u1725,m113,YNYR,She had another name once.
59339,L338512,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Her name is Death.
59340,L338511,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name."
59341,L338510,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,She has the power to kill.
59342,L338509,u1725,m113,YNYR,She has the power of vision.
59343,L338508,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
59344,L338507,u1725,m113,YNYR,Yes.
59345,L338506,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,The Widow of the Web?
59346,L338505,u1725,m113,YNYR,I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
59347,L338452,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved."
59348,L338451,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,The leader of the Dark Ones?
59349,L338397,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,"No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us."
59350,L338396,u1725,m113,YNYR,Many have perished in that maze.
59351,L338395,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
59352,L338392,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
59353,L338391,u1725,m113,YNYR,We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
59354,L338369,u1725,m113,YNYR,"No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen."
59355,L338368,u1720,m113,TORQUIL,Knowledge I wouldn't want.
59356,L338622,u1724,m113,WIDOW,"There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other."
59357,L338621,u1725,m113,YNYR,You will come with me.
59358,L338620,u1724,m113,WIDOW,"You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out."
59359,L338619,u1725,m113,YNYR,I cannot stop the sand.
59360,L338616,u1725,m113,YNYR,Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
59361,L338615,u1724,m113,WIDOW,It will not help.
59362,L338614,u1724,m113,WIDOW,"Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here."
59363,L338613,u1725,m113,YNYR,A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
59364,L338612,u1724,m113,WIDOW,No.
59365,L338611,u1725,m113,YNYR,Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
59366,L338610,u1724,m113,WIDOW,You lie!
59367,L338609,u1725,m113,YNYR,There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
59368,L338608,u1724,m113,WIDOW,Why must you know?
59369,L338607,u1725,m113,YNYR,The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
59370,L338606,u1724,m113,WIDOW,Of what?
59371,L338605,u1725,m113,YNYR,Knowledge.
59372,L338604,u1724,m113,WIDOW,Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
59373,L338603,u1725,m113,YNYR,"Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see."
59374,L338602,u1724,m113,WIDOW,Yes.
59375,L338601,u1725,m113,YNYR,You see?
59376,L338600,u1724,m113,WIDOW,Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
59377,L338599,u1725,m113,YNYR,It is no trickery.
59378,L338598,u1724,m113,WIDOW,Do not try your trickery on me!
59379,L338597,u1724,m113,WIDOW,I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
59380,L338596,u1725,m113,YNYR,Where is he? My son.
59381,L338595,u1724,m113,WIDOW,You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
59382,L338594,u1725,m113,YNYR,You said nothing. You told me nothing.
59383,L338593,u1724,m113,WIDOW,You had a son.
59384,L338592,u1725,m113,YNYR,We had no children.
59385,L338591,u1724,m113,WIDOW,She bore you many children?
59386,L338590,u1725,m113,YNYR,"No, she was not as beautiful."
59387,L338589,u1724,m113,WIDOW,She was not as beautiful.
59388,L338588,u1725,m113,YNYR,Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
59389,L338587,u1724,m113,WIDOW,But you would not stay with me.
59390,L338586,u1725,m113,YNYR,The most beautiful woman in the world.
59391,L338585,u1724,m113,WIDOW,I was beautiful then.
59392,L338584,u1725,m113,YNYR,It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
59393,L338583,u1724,m113,WIDOW,It is fifty years since I heard that name.
59394,L338582,u1725,m113,YNYR,Ynyr!
59395,L338581,u1724,m113,WIDOW,Who speaks that name!
59396,L346853,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
59397,L346852,u1726,m114,COP,Yeah... How do you know it?
59398,L346851,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...Office 2702.
59399,L346850,u1726,m114,COP,"OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD."
59400,L346849,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Give me his name, I will mail him."
59401,L346848,u1726,m114,COP,"Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself."
59402,L346847,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$."
59403,L346846,u1726,m114,COP,Why do you want to know?
59404,L346845,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,What's that man's name?
59405,L347015,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
59406,L347014,u1727,m114,JENNY,...Good...  But what's special in him?
59407,L347013,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
59408,L347012,u1727,m114,JENNY,Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
59409,L347011,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...What?
59410,L347010,u1727,m114,JENNY,"I can't believe it! ""Yes I think""... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?"
59411,L347009,u1727,m114,JENNY,"Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?"
59412,L347008,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,No.
59413,L347007,u1727,m114,JENNY,"YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?"
59414,L347006,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
59415,L347005,u1727,m114,JENNY,"Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?"
59416,L347004,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see."
59417,L347003,u1727,m114,JENNY,She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
59418,L347002,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,No?
59419,L347001,u1727,m114,JENNY,"Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?"
59420,L346776,u1735,m114,TONY,"Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift."
59421,L346775,u1728,m114,LEON,"Well, I don't need them..."
59422,L346774,u1735,m114,TONY,Take...
59423,L346772,u1735,m114,TONY,"I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!"
59424,L346771,u1728,m114,LEON,Why can't I have a bank account?
59425,L346769,u1735,m114,TONY,"Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!"
59426,L346768,u1728,m114,LEON,Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
59427,L346767,u1735,m114,TONY,"Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?"
59428,L346766,u1728,m114,LEON,"No, no."
59429,L346764,u1728,m114,LEON,No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
59430,L346763,u1735,m114,TONY,Do you need money?
59431,L346762,u1728,m114,LEON,Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
59432,L346761,u1735,m114,TONY,"That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!"
59433,L346760,u1728,m114,LEON,"Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids."
59434,L346759,u1735,m114,TONY,At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
59435,L346758,u1728,m114,LEON,Yes.
59436,L346757,u1735,m114,TONY,"It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?"
59437,L346756,u1728,m114,LEON,...Not at all.
59438,L346755,u1735,m114,TONY,Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
59439,L346754,u1728,m114,LEON,Yeah.
59440,L346753,u1735,m114,TONY,"...You moved too, didn't you?"
59441,L347145,u1728,m114,LEON,"Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!"
59442,L347144,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,You say it just to calm me!
59443,L347142,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!"
59444,L347141,u1728,m114,LEON,"Mathilda, listen!"
59445,L347140,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,No! I don't want to leave you!!
59446,L347138,u1728,m114,LEON,"Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!"
59447,L347137,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"How shall we get out now, Leon?"
59448,L347135,u1728,m114,LEON,Good! Snipers can't be in position.
59449,L347134,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,I don't know... Five minutes.
59450,L347133,u1728,m114,LEON,It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
59451,L347132,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?"
59452,L347121,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this..."
59453,L347120,u1728,m114,LEON,"Yeah, what?"
59454,L347119,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?"
59455,L347118,u1728,m114,LEON,"Nothing, for the moment."
59456,L347117,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"What do you do, with the money you earn?"
59457,L347116,u1728,m114,LEON,...Yes.
59458,L347115,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,May I ask you a personal question?
59459,L347114,u1728,m114,LEON,"Three times, then two times."
59460,L347113,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Yes.
59461,L347112,u1728,m114,LEON,"You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?"
59462,L347101,u1728,m114,LEON,"...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend..."
59463,L347100,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?"
59464,L347098,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?"
59465,L347097,u1728,m114,LEON,"...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable."
59466,L347095,u1728,m114,LEON,"Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!"
59467,L347094,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!"
59468,L347093,u1728,m114,LEON,"...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this."
59469,L347092,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?"
59470,L347091,u1728,m114,LEON,...I don't know.
59471,L347090,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,How many girlfriends did you have?
59472,L347088,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...Don't you like me?
59473,L347087,u1728,m114,LEON,...No...
59474,L347086,u1728,m114,LEON,I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
59475,L347085,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...Don't you drink?
59476,L347083,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?"
59477,L347082,u1728,m114,LEON,"Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?"
59478,L347072,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
59479,L347071,u1728,m114,LEON,"Poor darling, and then?"
59480,L347068,u1728,m114,LEON,"I love you too, and I don't want to lose you."
59481,L347067,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"I love you so much, Leon."
59482,L347066,u1728,m114,LEON,"I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear."
59483,L346995,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
59484,L346994,u1728,m114,LEON,"Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up."
59485,L346993,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
59486,L346992,u1728,m114,LEON,"No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh."
59487,L346990,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!"
59488,L346989,u1728,m114,LEON,Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
59489,L346988,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!"
59490,L346987,u1728,m114,LEON,"...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs..."
59491,L346986,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Risky business, isn't it?"
59492,L346985,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
59493,L346984,u1728,m114,LEON,It's too big.
59494,L346981,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
59495,L346980,u1728,m114,LEON,Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
59496,L346979,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,A little...
59497,L346978,u1728,m114,LEON,"You're darkening the picture, aren't you?"
59498,L346977,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more."
59499,L346976,u1728,m114,LEON,"...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?"
59500,L346975,u1728,m114,LEON,"Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it."
59501,L346974,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other."
59502,L346973,u1728,m114,LEON,"Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice."
59503,L346933,u1728,m114,LEON,...Later.
59504,L346932,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
59505,L346931,u1728,m114,LEON,"There are better things.  You see the importance of the ""moment"".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing."
59506,L346930,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
59507,L346927,u1728,m114,LEON,...Why didn't he close the window?
59508,L346926,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks."
59509,L346925,u1728,m114,LEON,Where are you going?
59510,L346924,u1728,m114,LEON,I think.
59511,L346923,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,What shall we do?
59512,L346922,u1728,m114,LEON,...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
59513,L346918,u1728,m114,LEON,...17.
59514,L346917,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?"
59515,L346916,u1728,m114,LEON,Mathilda?!
59516,L346915,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...OK.  I love you anyway.
59517,L346914,u1728,m114,LEON,"Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?"
59518,L346913,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,When I say I love you.
59519,L346912,u1728,m114,LEON,What?
59520,L346911,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"...You don't believe me, don't you?"
59521,L346908,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us."
59522,L346907,u1728,m114,LEON,Stop. Everyone is looking.
59523,L346905,u1728,m114,LEON,"Mathilda, stop, please!"
59524,L346904,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...I'm going to kiss you.
59525,L346902,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?"
59526,L346901,u1728,m114,LEON,"It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception."
59527,L346874,u1728,m114,LEON,"OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second..."
59528,L346873,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep."
59529,L346870,u1728,m114,LEON,I never rent my gear.
59530,L346869,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
59531,L346868,u1728,m114,LEON,Too heavy.
59532,L346867,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Why?
59533,L346866,u1728,m114,LEON,Not taken.
59534,L346857,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!"
59535,L346856,u1728,m114,LEON,...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
59536,L346814,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
59537,L346813,u1728,m114,LEON,"You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!"
59538,L346811,u1728,m114,LEON,"No, you can't go out."
59539,L346810,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,For musicals?  That's part of the job!
59540,L346809,u1728,m114,LEON,No.
59541,L346808,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,May I go to the cinema?
59542,L346806,u1728,m114,LEON,"Quick doesn't mean ""ready"". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?"
59543,L346805,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly."
59544,L346801,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Yes.
59545,L346800,u1728,m114,LEON,Mathilda? May I come in?
59546,L346796,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...Because I feel it.
59547,L346795,u1728,m114,LEON,"How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?"
59548,L346794,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me..."
59549,L346789,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
59550,L346788,u1728,m114,LEON,"I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?"
59551,L346787,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"You were scared, weren't you?"
59552,L346786,u1728,m114,LEON,"Come on, get down!"
59553,L346781,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,OK.
59554,L346780,u1728,m114,LEON,Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
59555,L346746,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?"
59556,L346745,u1728,m114,LEON,What?
59557,L346744,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,It's incredible! How did you do it?
59558,L346743,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Yes, yes..."
59559,L346742,u1728,m114,LEON,What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
59560,L346727,u1728,m114,LEON,OK.
59561,L346726,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,The yellow and pink.
59562,L346725,u1728,m114,LEON,"Now, try a running guy."
59563,L346724,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,OK.
59564,L346723,u1728,m114,LEON,"It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards."
59565,L346722,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?"
59566,L346721,u1728,m114,LEON,Good! First shot!
59567,L346716,u1728,m114,LEON,Perfect.
59568,L346715,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"The fat man down there, on the bench."
59569,L346712,u1728,m114,LEON,Whoever.
59570,L346711,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Who'll I aim at?
59571,L346710,u1728,m114,LEON,"Yeah...  Come on, have a little training."
59572,L346709,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Wow! It's brilliant!
59573,L346708,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
59574,L346707,u1728,m114,LEON,Rocket launcher.
59575,L346706,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
59576,L346705,u1728,m114,LEON,"Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic."
59577,L346704,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"What, for example?"
59578,L346703,u1728,m114,LEON,"Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means."
59579,L346702,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,How can you say it?
59580,L346701,u1728,m114,LEON,130... 140...
59581,L346700,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Huh... 500 meters?
59582,L346699,u1728,m114,LEON,"Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?"
59583,L346698,u1728,m114,LEON,Good.
59584,L346697,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"OK, I'm fine."
59585,L347129,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,I have no fear.
59586,L347128,u1729,m114,MAN,Don't fear.
59587,L346938,u1729,m114,MAN,...One second.
59588,L346937,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost..."
59589,L346936,u1729,m114,MAN,...Yes?
59590,L346893,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch."
59591,L346892,u1729,m114,MAN,"Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything."
59592,L346891,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"...I got lost, Mister."
59593,L346890,u1729,m114,MAN,"Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle."
59594,L346889,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!"
59595,L346888,u1729,m114,MAN,Yes?
59596,L346831,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...No... he's my lover...
59597,L346830,u1731,m114,RECEPTIONIST,Huh?
59598,L346829,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Yeah, but he's not exactly my father..."
59599,L346828,u1731,m114,RECEPTIONIST,"Huh, that's good!"
59600,L346827,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...Composer.
59601,L346826,u1731,m114,RECEPTIONIST,"Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?"
59602,L346825,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
59603,L346824,u1731,m114,RECEPTIONIST,Huh? That's smart!
59604,L346823,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise."
59605,L346822,u1731,m114,RECEPTIONIST,"I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything."
59606,L346821,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,"I'm sick with practicing, that's it..."
59607,L346820,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Fine...
59608,L346819,u1731,m114,RECEPTIONIST,"How are you, Miss?"
59609,L347050,u1734,m114,THE BOSS,"Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course."
59610,L347049,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Can I sit on the stairways now?
59611,L347048,u1734,m114,THE BOSS,...OK... Good.
59612,L347045,u1734,m114,THE BOSS,Ten dollars... A month.
59613,L347044,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,...And how much is it?
59614,L347043,u1734,m114,THE BOSS,"Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule..."
59615,L347042,u1730,m114,MATHILDA,Huh? Why?
59616,L347041,u1734,m114,THE BOSS,You can't sit here like that.
59617,L346971,u1732,m114,RINALDI,Salute.
59618,L346970,u1735,m114,TONY,Salute.
59619,L346969,u1732,m114,RINALDI,...Yeah.
59620,L346968,u1735,m114,TONY,"You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world."
59621,L346967,u1732,m114,RINALDI,I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
59622,L346965,u1735,m114,TONY,"It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout."
59623,L346964,u1732,m114,RINALDI,No...
59624,L346963,u1735,m114,TONY,"Did you fish in Messina? The ""pesce spada""?"
59625,L346962,u1732,m114,RINALDI,Yes... Twice.
59626,L346961,u1735,m114,TONY,"Have you ever been in Messina, son?"
59627,L346959,u1732,m114,RINALDI,No... Dino's.
59628,L346958,u1735,m114,TONY,"Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?"
59629,L346957,u1732,m114,RINALDI,Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
59630,L346956,u1735,m114,TONY,Is he still alive?
59631,L346955,u1732,m114,RINALDI,Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
59632,L346954,u1735,m114,TONY,...Who sent you?
59633,L346953,u1732,m114,RINALDI,I know... But I'm a little pressed.
59634,L346952,u1735,m114,TONY,"It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure..."
59635,L346951,u1732,m114,RINALDI,"Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there..."
59636,L346950,u1735,m114,TONY,But... He works for your same employer?
59637,L346948,u1735,m114,TONY,Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
59638,L346947,u1732,m114,RINALDI,Messina.
59639,L346946,u1735,m114,TONY,Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
59640,L347030,u1735,m114,TONY,These guys have no place.  They change virtually everyday. And his name...  It's a surname.
59641,L347029,u1733,m114,STANSFIELD,May we have this wolf's name and address?
59642,L347028,u1735,m114,TONY,"Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves."
59643,L347025,u1735,m114,TONY,...Even his mother wouldn't.
59644,L347024,u1733,m114,STANSFIELD,Do you recognize him?
59645,L347023,u1735,m114,TONY,Then...
59646,L347022,u1733,m114,STANSFIELD,"I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?"
59647,L347021,u1735,m114,TONY,"You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles."
59648,L339816,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the ""Journal of Educational Psychology"", ""American Journal of Psychology"", ""Psychology Review"" and ""Science""... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid."
59649,L339815,u1743,m115,GERALD,Here comes the resume.
59650,L339814,u1736,m115,ADELLE,Why am I such an authority?
59651,L339813,u1743,m115,GERALD,This smells good.
59652,L339696,u1743,m115,GERALD,Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
59653,L339695,u1736,m115,ADELLE,What is it?
59654,L339683,u1743,m115,GERALD,For a walk.  I don't know.
59655,L339682,u1736,m115,ADELLE,Where?
59656,L339681,u1743,m115,GERALD,He probably just went somewhere.
59657,L340174,u1736,m115,ADELLE,I won't let you die.
59658,L340173,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I have to finish first.
59659,L340025,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
59660,L340024,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life."
59661,L340023,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want."
59662,L340022,u1736,m115,ADELLE,What?
59663,L340021,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
59664,L340010,u1748,m115,MAURICE,How serious is it?
59665,L340009,u1736,m115,ADELLE,I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
59666,L340008,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
59667,L340007,u1736,m115,ADELLE,Maybe later.
59668,L340006,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Are you two planning kids?
59669,L339790,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan."
59670,L339789,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Nothing's going to happen.
59671,L339788,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?"
59672,L339787,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
59673,L339786,u1736,m115,ADELLE,Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
59674,L339785,u1748,m115,MAURICE,No it's not.
59675,L339784,u1736,m115,ADELLE,If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
59676,L339783,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I'll make it.
59677,L339782,u1736,m115,ADELLE,What if you don't make it?
59678,L339781,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
59679,L339780,u1736,m115,ADELLE,She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
59680,L339779,u1748,m115,MAURICE,It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
59681,L339778,u1736,m115,ADELLE,It's impossible.
59682,L339777,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
59683,L339776,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --"
59684,L339775,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
59685,L339774,u1736,m115,ADELLE,I don't accept that.
59686,L339773,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I have new dreams now.
59687,L339772,u1736,m115,ADELLE,And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
59688,L339761,u1748,m115,MAURICE,High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
59689,L339760,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?"
59690,L339709,u1737,m115,DALLY,"Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction..."
59691,L339708,u1736,m115,ADELLE,Thank you.
59692,L339707,u1737,m115,DALLY,"Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you."
59693,L339706,u1736,m115,ADELLE,A couple days to a few months if untreated.
59694,L339705,u1737,m115,DALLY,How long does this... Mania last?
59695,L339704,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous."
59696,L339703,u1737,m115,DALLY,We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
59697,L339702,u1736,m115,ADELLE,"Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him."
59698,L339701,u1737,m115,DALLY,A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
59699,L339700,u1736,m115,ADELLE,Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
59700,L339699,u1737,m115,DALLY,What would you like us to do?
59701,L339752,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I'll kill you!
59702,L339751,u1738,m115,DENNY,Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
59703,L339750,u1748,m115,MAURICE,That's enough.
59704,L339749,u1738,m115,DENNY,A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
59705,L339742,u1738,m115,DENNY,"You need a ride, Preacher?"
59706,L339741,u1748,m115,MAURICE,This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
59707,L339739,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance."
59708,L339738,u1738,m115,DENNY,Are you a preacher?
59709,L339735,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
59710,L339734,u1738,m115,DENNY,Mine.
59711,L340020,u1739,m115,DR. RAY,It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
59712,L340019,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
59713,L340018,u1739,m115,DR. RAY,We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
59714,L340017,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What steps do we take now?
59715,L340014,u1739,m115,DR. RAY,"It can, but it'll have to wait in line."
59716,L340013,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Can it kill me?
59717,L340012,u1739,m115,DR. RAY,"The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, ""Claudication,""  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered."
59718,L339599,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Twenty miles?  I see.
59719,L339598,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
59720,L339597,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Just for curiosity sake that's all?
59721,L339596,u1748,m115,MAURICE,No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
59722,L339595,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
59723,L339594,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Okay.
59724,L339593,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
59725,L339592,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You have?
59726,L339591,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,I've seen it before.
59727,L339590,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You do?
59728,L339589,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,I know what you're getting at.
59729,L339587,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
59730,L339586,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,Yes -- you are.
59731,L339585,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?"
59732,L339584,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
59733,L339583,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Pardon?
59734,L339582,u1740,m115,DR. ROYCE,So what's the deal Maurice?
59735,L340170,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Good.
59736,L340169,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"The beach of Pacifica, California."
59737,L340168,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?"
59738,L340167,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Go to sleep Ellen.
59739,L340166,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"If I die, you'll know where to look for me?"
59740,L340165,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Yes.
59741,L340164,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Maurice?
59742,L340163,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be."
59743,L340162,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Why there?
59744,L340161,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"Pacifica, California."
59745,L340160,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Where?
59746,L340159,u1741,m115,ELLEN,I know where my heaven is.
59747,L340158,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Did you have a dream?
59748,L340157,u1741,m115,ELLEN,I think it's a different place for each person.
59749,L340156,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I don't know.
59750,L339966,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone."
59751,L339965,u1741,m115,ELLEN,That's okay -- really it is.
59752,L339964,u1748,m115,MAURICE,He's plastered.
59753,L339963,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Your father?
59754,L339805,u1741,m115,ELLEN,It'll make it.
59755,L339804,u1748,m115,MAURICE,It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
59756,L339803,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
59757,L339802,u1741,m115,ELLEN,It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
59758,L339725,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Don't be so sure.
59759,L339724,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway."
59760,L339723,u1741,m115,ELLEN,You can change.
59761,L339722,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen."
59762,L339721,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech."
59763,L339720,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --"
59764,L339719,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Yes.
59765,L339718,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"You've just decided, is that right?"
59766,L339717,u1741,m115,ELLEN,I want children.
59767,L339716,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You can't change your mind.
59768,L339715,u1741,m115,ELLEN,I've changed my mind.
59769,L339714,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I thought we both wanted the same things.
59770,L339654,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Please tell me.
59771,L339653,u1741,m115,ELLEN,It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
59772,L339650,u1748,m115,MAURICE,No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
59773,L339649,u1741,m115,ELLEN,You like to take walks?
59774,L339648,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Walk with me?
59775,L339540,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I will -- I promise.
59776,L339539,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Show me.
59777,L339538,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"I do love you... very, very much."
59778,L339531,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?"
59779,L339530,u1748,m115,MAURICE,There's no reason.
59780,L339529,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Then why?
59781,L339528,u1748,m115,MAURICE,No.
59782,L339527,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
59783,L339526,u1748,m115,MAURICE,A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
59784,L339525,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Why do you polish it?
59785,L339524,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You're talking to me?
59786,L339523,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Why do you polish that thing all the time?
59787,L339521,u1741,m115,ELLEN,No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
59788,L339520,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
59789,L339519,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Anything?
59790,L339518,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Yes.
59791,L339517,u1741,m115,ELLEN,I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
59792,L339516,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You don't think I love you?
59793,L339515,u1741,m115,ELLEN,Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
59794,L339514,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
59795,L339512,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I don't follow.
59796,L339511,u1741,m115,ELLEN,What it is -- is the truth.
59797,L339510,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
59798,L339509,u1741,m115,ELLEN,... Love is shown through actions not just words.
59799,L339507,u1741,m115,ELLEN,We can do it together.
59800,L339506,u1748,m115,MAURICE,It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
59801,L339505,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it."
59802,L339504,u1748,m115,MAURICE,The new store?
59803,L339503,u1741,m115,ELLEN,What?
59804,L339502,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Ellen?
59805,L339477,u1741,m115,ELLEN,"Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today."
59806,L339476,u1748,m115,MAURICE,It's a special day isn't it?
59807,L339474,u1741,m115,ELLEN,It's just a regular day.
59808,L339473,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
59809,L339472,u1741,m115,ELLEN,There was no card.
59810,L339471,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You thought I sent them?
59811,L339469,u1741,m115,ELLEN,The flowers... they're beautiful.
59812,L339468,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Yes?
59813,L339905,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can."
59814,L339904,u1742,m115,FATHER,You don't have to prove anything to her.
59815,L339903,u1748,m115,MAURICE,About my love for her.
59816,L339902,u1742,m115,FATHER,Doubts?  About what?
59817,L339901,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
59818,L339900,u1742,m115,FATHER,That's a reasonable assumption.
59819,L339899,u1748,m115,MAURICE,And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
59820,L339898,u1742,m115,FATHER,Most certainly.
59821,L339897,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
59822,L339896,u1742,m115,FATHER,Why?
59823,L339895,u1742,m115,FATHER,I see.
59824,L339894,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
59825,L339893,u1742,m115,FATHER,From where?
59826,L339892,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Pacifica, California."
59827,L339891,u1742,m115,FATHER,To where?
59828,L339888,u1742,m115,FATHER,"I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now."
59829,L339887,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
59830,L339886,u1742,m115,FATHER,If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
59831,L339885,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What did they ask?
59832,L339884,u1754,m115,TANDY,Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
59833,L339883,u1744,m115,HANSEN,Jumped where?
59834,L339882,u1754,m115,TANDY,Shit!  He jumped!
59835,L339879,u1754,m115,TANDY,That's all right isn't it?
59836,L339878,u1744,m115,HANSEN,I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
59837,L339856,u1744,m115,HANSEN,P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
59838,L339855,u1754,m115,TANDY,Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
59839,L339854,u1754,m115,TANDY,Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
59840,L339853,u1744,m115,HANSEN,A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
59841,L339850,u1744,m115,HANSEN,"If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses."
59842,L339849,u1754,m115,TANDY,This guy's not a murderer.
59843,L339848,u1744,m115,HANSEN,It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
59844,L339847,u1754,m115,TANDY,Not our problem.
59845,L339846,u1744,m115,HANSEN,Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
59846,L339845,u1754,m115,TANDY,Not our problem.
59847,L339844,u1744,m115,HANSEN,Red flags man.
59848,L339833,u1754,m115,TANDY,"If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space."
59849,L339832,u1744,m115,HANSEN,"Red flag, man."
59850,L339831,u1754,m115,TANDY,His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
59851,L339830,u1744,m115,HANSEN,What's his story?
59852,L339945,u1745,m115,ISAAC,You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
59853,L339944,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end."
59854,L339943,u1745,m115,ISAAC,Nine.
59855,L339942,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
59856,L339941,u1745,m115,ISAAC,That's me.
59857,L339940,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove."
59858,L339938,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Who's telling this story?
59859,L339937,u1745,m115,ISAAC,You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
59860,L339936,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove."
59861,L339932,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
59862,L339931,u1745,m115,ISAAC,You tell stories?
59863,L339930,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Your parents would want you to be in bed.
59864,L339929,u1745,m115,ISAAC,You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
59865,L339928,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I thought you were asleep.
59866,L339918,u1745,m115,ISAAC,Yeah!
59867,L339917,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
59868,L339916,u1745,m115,ISAAC,"You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon."
59869,L339915,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Is that right?
59870,L339914,u1745,m115,ISAAC,"You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger."
59871,L339913,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
59872,L339912,u1745,m115,ISAAC,I'm Isaac... I'm three.
59873,L339911,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Well, hello."
59874,L339608,u1748,m115,MAURICE,By car right?
59875,L339607,u1746,m115,JOSELLE,"Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat."
59876,L339606,u1746,m115,JOSELLE,"This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance..."
59877,L339605,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Perhaps there's another route?
59878,L339604,u1746,m115,JOSELLE,What was that?
59879,L339603,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
59880,L339602,u1746,m115,JOSELLE,"Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to it.  From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles..."
59881,L339601,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Making the grand total?
59882,L339600,u1746,m115,JOSELLE,Each inch represents 150 miles...
59883,L339977,u1747,m115,KRIS,Maybe.
59884,L339976,u1749,m115,MICHELLE,"Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?"
59885,L339973,u1749,m115,MICHELLE,"Umm, Coalville Utah."
59886,L339972,u1747,m115,KRIS,"Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me."
59887,L339872,u1747,m115,KRIS,"God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden."
59888,L339871,u1749,m115,MICHELLE,"Umm, no.  It's just that --"
59889,L339870,u1747,m115,KRIS,What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
59890,L339869,u1749,m115,MICHELLE,The Gazette's small huh?
59891,L339868,u1747,m115,KRIS,Mammoth.
59892,L339867,u1749,m115,MICHELLE,This story is big huh?
59893,L340069,u1748,m115,MAURICE,No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
59894,L340068,u1747,m115,KRIS,She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
59895,L340066,u1748,m115,MAURICE,It's mine to risk.
59896,L340065,u1747,m115,KRIS,"Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life."
59897,L340064,u1748,m115,MAURICE,... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
59898,L340063,u1747,m115,KRIS,Don't do this.
59899,L340062,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
59900,L340061,u1747,m115,KRIS,I do.
59901,L340060,u1748,m115,MAURICE,We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
59902,L340059,u1747,m115,KRIS,"I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more."
59903,L340058,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"What, come on?"
59904,L340057,u1747,m115,KRIS,Come on Mr. Parker.
59905,L340056,u1747,m115,KRIS,Saluting.
59906,L340055,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Are they standing?
59907,L340053,u1747,m115,KRIS,I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
59908,L340052,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
59909,L340050,u1747,m115,KRIS,You were right.  From the heart is always better.
59910,L340049,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all."
59911,L340048,u1747,m115,KRIS,I missed you to Mr. Parker.
59912,L340047,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I missed you Kris.
59913,L340046,u1747,m115,KRIS,You're amazing.
59914,L340045,u1748,m115,MAURICE,... The Grapes of Wrath.
59915,L340044,u1747,m115,KRIS,Tom Joad?
59916,L339677,u1748,m115,MAURICE,She never ate a slice.
59917,L339676,u1747,m115,KRIS,What Mr. Parker?
59918,L339675,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
59919,L339673,u1748,m115,MAURICE,So I've been informed.
59920,L339672,u1747,m115,KRIS,"Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away."
59921,L339671,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her."
59922,L339670,u1747,m115,KRIS,Why know?
59923,L339669,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
59924,L339668,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me."
59925,L339667,u1747,m115,KRIS,I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
59926,L339666,u1748,m115,MAURICE,She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
59927,L339665,u1747,m115,KRIS,She knew you loved her.
59928,L339664,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
59929,L339663,u1747,m115,KRIS,"Oh, a coastal city.  That's good."
59930,L339662,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city."
59931,L339661,u1747,m115,KRIS,You're walking to California?
59932,L339660,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I told you.
59933,L339659,u1747,m115,KRIS,You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
59934,L339658,u1748,m115,MAURICE,... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
59935,L339657,u1747,m115,KRIS,Phileas Fogg?
59936,L339632,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
59937,L339631,u1747,m115,KRIS,The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
59938,L339630,u1748,m115,MAURICE,California.
59939,L339629,u1747,m115,KRIS,Walking where?
59940,L339628,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I'm walking there Kris.
59941,L339627,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Tomorrow.
59942,L339626,u1747,m115,KRIS,When are you leaving?
59943,L339623,u1748,m115,MAURICE,California.
59944,L339622,u1747,m115,KRIS,Where?
59945,L339621,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Yes.
59946,L339620,u1747,m115,KRIS,You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
59947,L339619,u1748,m115,MAURICE,No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
59948,L339618,u1747,m115,KRIS,Are you firing me?
59949,L339614,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
59950,L339613,u1747,m115,KRIS,This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
59951,L339612,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you."
59952,L339611,u1747,m115,KRIS,I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
59953,L339493,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else."
59954,L339492,u1747,m115,KRIS,What happened?
59955,L339491,u1747,m115,KRIS,"Pulitzer, here I come."
59956,L339490,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening."
59957,L339489,u1747,m115,KRIS,They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
59958,L339488,u1748,m115,MAURICE,It has to be a full character's name.
59959,L339487,u1747,m115,KRIS,You're amazing.
59960,L339486,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice."
59961,L340091,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,Someone should be with you.
59962,L340090,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
59963,L340082,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
59964,L340081,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,... My father.
59965,L340080,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,"Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks."
59966,L340079,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
59967,L340078,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,"They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did."
59968,L340077,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I need your help.
59969,L340076,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,You're in pain.
59970,L340074,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Do you have a car, Steph?"
59971,L340073,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,Steph.
59972,L340072,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What do your friends call you?
59973,L340002,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
59974,L340001,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,In a hospital.
59975,L340000,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Where am I?
59976,L339999,u1753,m115,STEPHANIE,There are a lot of people worried about you.
59977,L339577,u1751,m115,OLD WOMAN,Yes.
59978,L339576,u1748,m115,MAURICE,May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
59979,L339575,u1751,m115,OLD WOMAN,He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
59980,L339574,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Where did he go?
59981,L339571,u1751,m115,OLD WOMAN,Forty-seven years.
59982,L339570,u1748,m115,MAURICE,You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
59983,L339567,u1751,m115,OLD WOMAN,You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
59984,L339566,u1748,m115,MAURICE,I don't have kids.
59985,L339565,u1748,m115,MAURICE,"Oh, that's not mine."
59986,L339564,u1751,m115,OLD WOMAN,Is it a boy or a girl?
59987,L339563,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Good morning.
59988,L339562,u1751,m115,OLD WOMAN,Good morning.
59989,L340036,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What?  Who are you?
59990,L340035,u1752,m115,PRIEST,What's your shoe size?
59991,L340034,u1752,m115,PRIEST,I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
59992,L340033,u1748,m115,MAURICE,What do you mean?
59993,L340032,u1752,m115,PRIEST,He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
59994,L340031,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
59995,L340030,u1752,m115,PRIEST,How are you feeling?
59996,L340029,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Hello.
59997,L340028,u1752,m115,PRIEST,"Hello, Mr. Parker."
59998,L339954,u1750,m115,MR. CALDWELL,This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
59999,L339953,u1748,m115,MAURICE,This isn't right.
60000,L339952,u1750,m115,MR. CALDWELL,I really want that watch.
60001,L339950,u1750,m115,MR. CALDWELL,"No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that."
60002,L339949,u1748,m115,MAURICE,It's yours.
60003,L339948,u1750,m115,MR. CALDWELL,I've always wanted a watch like that.
60004,L339925,u1750,m115,MR. CALDWELL,We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
60005,L339924,u1748,m115,MAURICE,Evening News?
60006,L339923,u1750,m115,MR. CALDWELL,"If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here."
60007,L343647,u1755,m116,BEN,Water.
60008,L343646,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
60009,L343645,u1755,m116,BEN,Water?
60010,L343644,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,Water?
60011,L343643,u1755,m116,BEN,No.
60012,L343642,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,Sparkling apple cider?
60013,L343641,u1755,m116,BEN,No.
60014,L343640,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,Coffee?
60015,L343639,u1755,m116,BEN,No.
60016,L343638,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,Orange soda?
60017,L343637,u1755,m116,BEN,...Noooo.
60018,L343636,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
60019,L343635,u1755,m116,BEN,What do you think I should get?
60020,L343634,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
60021,L343633,u1755,m116,BEN,No alcohol?
60022,L343632,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,"Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol."
60023,L343631,u1755,m116,BEN,What are my choices?
60024,L343630,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,What do you want?
60025,L343629,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem."
60026,L343628,u1759,m116,WAITRESS,"There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you."
60027,L344081,u1758,m116,SERA,Yes.
60028,L344080,u1755,m116,BEN,You know I love you... yeah?
60029,L344075,u1758,m116,SERA,"Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale."
60030,L344074,u1755,m116,BEN,I wanted to see you...
60031,L344030,u1755,m116,BEN,Yes... I guess I knew that.
60032,L344029,u1758,m116,SERA,There are limits.
60033,L344021,u1758,m116,SERA,One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
60034,L344020,u1755,m116,BEN,"Will you lighten up, please?"
60035,L344019,u1758,m116,SERA,And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
60036,L344018,u1755,m116,BEN,Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
60037,L343997,u1755,m116,BEN,I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
60038,L343996,u1758,m116,SERA,I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
60039,L343995,u1755,m116,BEN,OK.
60040,L343994,u1758,m116,SERA,Let's stay for a while.
60041,L343993,u1755,m116,BEN,I like it here with you.
60042,L343992,u1758,m116,SERA,Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
60043,L343991,u1755,m116,BEN,Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
60044,L343990,u1758,m116,SERA,"Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean."
60045,L343989,u1755,m116,BEN,"Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle."
60046,L343988,u1758,m116,SERA,"Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening."
60047,L343986,u1755,m116,BEN,Yeah... I'd like that.
60048,L343985,u1758,m116,SERA,Shall we go away for a couple of days?
60049,L343984,u1755,m116,BEN,You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
60050,L343983,u1758,m116,SERA,I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
60051,L343981,u1758,m116,SERA,They wouldn't know.
60052,L343980,u1755,m116,BEN,Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
60053,L343978,u1755,m116,BEN,No... we already talked about that.
60054,L343977,u1758,m116,SERA,Do you want me not to go tonight?
60055,L343976,u1755,m116,BEN,"Thank you, Sera."
60056,L343975,u1758,m116,SERA,Yes... I'll give you that.
60057,L343974,u1755,m116,BEN,Please!
60058,L343973,u1755,m116,BEN,Can we just ignore it?
60059,L343972,u1758,m116,SERA,I don't understand any of that.
60060,L343971,u1755,m116,BEN,Can we just forget it?
60061,L343970,u1758,m116,SERA,What was that all about?
60062,L343962,u1755,m116,BEN,"I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean."
60063,L343961,u1758,m116,SERA,Your color.
60064,L343957,u1755,m116,BEN,"OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink."
60065,L343956,u1758,m116,SERA,Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
60066,L343920,u1758,m116,SERA,Be careful.
60067,L343919,u1755,m116,BEN,Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
60068,L343917,u1755,m116,BEN,That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
60069,L343916,u1758,m116,SERA,"Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us."
60070,L343915,u1755,m116,BEN,I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
60071,L343914,u1758,m116,SERA,"You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed."
60072,L343911,u1755,m116,BEN,We?
60073,L343910,u1758,m116,SERA,I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
60074,L343909,u1755,m116,BEN,That's impressive. How did you do that?
60075,L343908,u1758,m116,SERA,"I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out."
60076,L343907,u1755,m116,BEN,"Oh, and what did you do?"
60077,L343906,u1758,m116,SERA,"Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling."
60078,L343905,u1755,m116,BEN,Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
60079,L343904,u1758,m116,SERA,How are you doing?
60080,L343901,u1758,m116,SERA,I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
60081,L343900,u1755,m116,BEN,What do you mean?
60082,L343899,u1758,m116,SERA,"Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight."
60083,L343898,u1755,m116,BEN,I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
60084,L343896,u1758,m116,SERA,Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
60085,L343895,u1755,m116,BEN,When?
60086,L343894,u1758,m116,SERA,I am planning to go out and do some work.
60087,L343893,u1758,m116,SERA,Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
60088,L343892,u1755,m116,BEN,Giving you money makes me want to come.
60089,L343890,u1758,m116,SERA,Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
60090,L343889,u1755,m116,BEN,I'm going to fill it right now.
60091,L343885,u1758,m116,SERA,"Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth."
60092,L343884,u1755,m116,BEN,"I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day."
60093,L343883,u1758,m116,SERA,Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
60094,L343879,u1758,m116,SERA,Whatever that means. Open your presents.
60095,L343878,u1755,m116,BEN,"Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck."
60096,L343877,u1758,m116,SERA,"Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job."
60097,L343876,u1755,m116,BEN,...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
60098,L343875,u1758,m116,SERA,I know that...
60099,L343874,u1755,m116,BEN,"No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul."
60100,L343873,u1758,m116,SERA,No?
60101,L343872,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money."
60102,L343871,u1758,m116,SERA,Well... OK...
60103,L343870,u1755,m116,BEN,Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
60104,L343869,u1758,m116,SERA,Why?
60105,L343868,u1755,m116,BEN,"I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?"
60106,L343867,u1758,m116,SERA,OK.
60107,L343866,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?"
60108,L343863,u1755,m116,BEN,Sorry.
60109,L343862,u1758,m116,SERA,Ben?
60110,L343859,u1755,m116,BEN,Of course.
60111,L343858,u1758,m116,SERA,"Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord."
60112,L343857,u1755,m116,BEN,Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
60113,L343855,u1755,m116,BEN,Right... OK...
60114,L343854,u1758,m116,SERA,Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
60115,L343853,u1755,m116,BEN,Hi!
60116,L343845,u1758,m116,SERA,I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
60117,L343844,u1755,m116,BEN,You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
60118,L343843,u1758,m116,SERA,What?
60119,L343842,u1755,m116,BEN,Sera... what you don't understand is...
60120,L343839,u1755,m116,BEN,Don't be silly?
60121,L343838,u1758,m116,SERA,"Don't you like me, Ben?"
60122,L343835,u1755,m116,BEN,"You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me."
60123,L343834,u1758,m116,SERA,That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
60124,L343833,u1755,m116,BEN,Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
60125,L343832,u1758,m116,SERA,So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
60126,L343831,u1755,m116,BEN,Sera you are crazy.
60127,L343830,u1758,m116,SERA,So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
60128,L343829,u1755,m116,BEN,Me neither.
60129,L343828,u1758,m116,SERA,"Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life."
60130,L343827,u1755,m116,BEN,Sera...
60131,L343826,u1758,m116,SERA,What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
60132,L343825,u1755,m116,BEN,What do you mean?
60133,L343824,u1758,m116,SERA,There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
60134,L343823,u1755,m116,BEN,"I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip."
60135,L343822,u1758,m116,SERA,"Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?"
60136,L343821,u1755,m116,BEN,How long have I been here?
60137,L343820,u1758,m116,SERA,"It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss."
60138,L343819,u1755,m116,BEN,Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
60139,L343818,u1758,m116,SERA,Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
60140,L343817,u1755,m116,BEN,"I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?"
60141,L343816,u1758,m116,SERA,"Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?"
60142,L343815,u1758,m116,SERA,I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
60143,L343814,u1755,m116,BEN,"That's astonishing. Sera, look..."
60144,L343813,u1758,m116,SERA,"Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you."
60145,L343812,u1755,m116,BEN,What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
60146,L343811,u1758,m116,SERA,"It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision."
60147,L343808,u1758,m116,SERA,Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
60148,L343807,u1755,m116,BEN,Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
60149,L343806,u1758,m116,SERA,First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
60150,L343805,u1758,m116,SERA,Very clever.
60151,L343804,u1755,m116,BEN,"Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either."
60152,L343803,u1758,m116,SERA,Yes.
60153,L343802,u1755,m116,BEN,Is that really what you want to ask me?
60154,L343801,u1758,m116,SERA,"I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?"
60155,L343800,u1755,m116,BEN,Do they have drinks?
60156,L343799,u1758,m116,SERA,"I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?"
60157,L343798,u1755,m116,BEN,I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
60158,L343797,u1755,m116,BEN,Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
60159,L343796,u1758,m116,SERA,Thank you. What time is it?
60160,L343795,u1755,m116,BEN,Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
60161,L343794,u1758,m116,SERA,You OK?
60162,L343792,u1755,m116,BEN,Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
60163,L343791,u1758,m116,SERA,You OK out there?
60164,L343790,u1755,m116,BEN,This is the home of an angel.
60165,L343789,u1755,m116,BEN,You do?
60166,L343788,u1758,m116,SERA,We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
60167,L343787,u1758,m116,SERA,I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
60168,L343786,u1755,m116,BEN,Yes.
60169,L343768,u1758,m116,SERA,"No, I can't have dinner with you."
60170,L343767,u1755,m116,BEN,I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
60171,L343766,u1758,m116,SERA,Are you serious.
60172,L343765,u1755,m116,BEN,"...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner."
60173,L343764,u1755,m116,BEN,I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
60174,L343763,u1758,m116,SERA,What's up?
60175,L343762,u1758,m116,SERA,"Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?"
60176,L343761,u1755,m116,BEN,Don't run away.
60177,L343760,u1755,m116,BEN,I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
60178,L343759,u1758,m116,SERA,"No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?"
60179,L343758,u1755,m116,BEN,If I was I'm sorry.
60180,L343727,u1755,m116,BEN,Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
60181,L343726,u1758,m116,SERA,Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
60182,L343725,u1755,m116,BEN,"I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day."
60183,L343724,u1758,m116,SERA,"How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?"
60184,L343723,u1755,m116,BEN,"I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow."
60185,L343722,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yes, that's right."
60186,L343721,u1758,m116,SERA,To death?
60187,L343720,u1755,m116,BEN,"No, I came here to drink... myself... you know..."
60188,L343718,u1755,m116,BEN,"I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want."
60189,L343717,u1758,m116,SERA,What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
60190,L343716,u1758,m116,SERA,OK... whatever.
60191,L343715,u1755,m116,BEN,Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
60192,L343714,u1758,m116,SERA,Do you want to fuck now?
60193,L343712,u1755,m116,BEN,Of course.
60194,L343711,u1758,m116,SERA,"A shot of tequila, if you can spare it."
60195,L343710,u1755,m116,BEN,Want a drink? I'm having one.
60196,L343709,u1755,m116,BEN,Of course.
60197,L343708,u1758,m116,SERA,Mind if I use the bathroom?
60198,L343705,u1758,m116,SERA,You were going to get my door.
60199,L343704,u1755,m116,BEN,"Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them."
60200,L343703,u1758,m116,SERA,I sometimes fade out.
60201,L343702,u1755,m116,BEN,You what?
60202,L343701,u1758,m116,SERA,I guess I do too.
60203,L343700,u1755,m116,BEN,"Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately."
60204,L343699,u1758,m116,SERA,Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
60205,L343697,u1758,m116,SERA,"No, this is fine. I was just wondering."
60206,L343696,u1755,m116,BEN,We can go to one if you'd prefer.
60207,L343695,u1758,m116,SERA,"I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?"
60208,L343693,u1758,m116,SERA,No -- S.E.R.A.
60209,L343692,u1755,m116,BEN,Sarah -- with an H?
60210,L343686,u1755,m116,BEN,Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
60211,L343685,u1758,m116,SERA,You're pretty drunk.
60212,L343684,u1758,m116,SERA,Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
60213,L343683,u1755,m116,BEN,"That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars."
60214,L343682,u1755,m116,BEN,That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
60215,L343681,u1758,m116,SERA,Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
60216,L343680,u1758,m116,SERA,"Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking."
60217,L343679,u1755,m116,BEN,Are you working?
60218,L343678,u1758,m116,SERA,Hello.
60219,L343677,u1755,m116,BEN,Hello!
60220,L343584,u1755,m116,BEN,I don't know. I'll find out though.
60221,L343583,u1756,m116,BRAD,"How much, do you think?"
60222,L343582,u1755,m116,BEN,"The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one."
60223,L343581,u1756,m116,BRAD,I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
60224,L343580,u1755,m116,BEN,How'd this happen?
60225,L343579,u1756,m116,BRAD,Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
60226,L343578,u1755,m116,BEN,What did they look like?
60227,L343577,u1756,m116,BRAD,Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
60228,L343576,u1755,m116,BEN,"Hey, Brad... how's it going?"
60229,L343754,u1757,m116,CONVENTIONEER,Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
60230,L343753,u1758,m116,SERA,Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
60231,L343752,u1758,m116,SERA,"I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood."
60232,L343751,u1757,m116,CONVENTIONEER,"A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes."
60233,L343750,u1758,m116,SERA,Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
60234,L343749,u1757,m116,CONVENTIONEER,Right here at the hotel. Why?
60235,L343748,u1758,m116,SERA,Where are you staying?
60236,L343747,u1757,m116,CONVENTIONEER,Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
60237,L343746,u1758,m116,SERA,"So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?"
60238,L343744,u1757,m116,CONVENTIONEER,Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
60239,L343743,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?"
60240,L343742,u1757,m116,CONVENTIONEER,About ready for another drink?
60241,L343781,u1760,m116,YURI,Sera... please go.
60242,L343780,u1758,m116,SERA,Yuri... are you...
60243,L343779,u1760,m116,YURI,"Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow."
60244,L343776,u1758,m116,SERA,No.
60245,L343775,u1760,m116,YURI,Have you told anyone that I'm here?
60246,L343771,u1758,m116,SERA,"It's me, Yuri."
60247,L343770,u1760,m116,YURI,Yes? What?
60248,L343736,u1760,m116,YURI,What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
60249,L343735,u1758,m116,SERA,Don't hit me.
60250,L343734,u1758,m116,SERA,Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
60251,L343733,u1760,m116,YURI,A full night on the street and this is all?
60252,L343732,u1758,m116,SERA,It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
60253,L343731,u1760,m116,YURI,Where have you been?
60254,L343607,u1760,m116,YURI,All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
60255,L343606,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes, of course. How much do you need?"
60256,L343605,u1760,m116,YURI,"It is, after all, Sera, my money."
60257,L343602,u1760,m116,YURI,With an old friend.
60258,L343601,u1758,m116,SERA,Where have you been staying?
60259,L343600,u1760,m116,YURI,"I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me."
60260,L343591,u1758,m116,SERA,"I am lonely, Yuri."
60261,L343590,u1760,m116,YURI,You have been lonely?
60262,L343589,u1760,m116,YURI,I will keep you safe. We are both older.
60263,L343588,u1758,m116,SERA,I've been all right.
60264,L343587,u1760,m116,YURI,You have been lonely?
60265,L343546,u1758,m116,SERA,"Please, Yuri."
60266,L343545,u1760,m116,YURI,"I want this, Sera. I need this!"
60267,L343544,u1758,m116,SERA,"I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups."
60268,L344772,u1767,m117,ELLE,I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
60269,L344771,u1761,m117,ADVISOR,"Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs."
60270,L344770,u1767,m117,ELLE,I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
60271,L344769,u1761,m117,ADVISOR,"Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced ""History of Lycra"". What are your backups?"
60272,L344768,u1767,m117,ELLE,I have a 4.0.
60273,L344767,u1761,m117,ADVISOR,But it's a top three school --
60274,L344766,u1767,m117,ELLE,That's right.
60275,L344765,u1761,m117,ADVISOR,Harvard Law School?

60280,L345515,u1765,m117,DONOVAN,What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
60281,L345158,u1765,m117,DONOVAN,I believe we are.
60282,L345157,u1762,m117,BROOKE,Are we done for today?

60288,L345150,u1765,m117,DONOVAN,He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
60289,L345149,u1762,m117,BROOKE,I loved him!

60292,L345146,u1765,m117,DONOVAN,Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.

60304,L345434,u1762,m117,BROOKE,He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --

60331,L345197,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,"I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police."

60333,L345586,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
60334,L345585,u1767,m117,ELLE,"And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?"
60335,L345581,u1767,m117,ELLE,That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
60336,L345580,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,Because they got wet.

60338,L345574,u1767,m117,ELLE,"You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure."
60339,L345573,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
60340,L345572,u1767,m117,ELLE,"How many, would you say?"

60342,L345570,u1767,m117,ELLE,"Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?"

60344,L345567,u1767,m117,ELLE,Where you got in the shower.
60345,L345566,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,"I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home."
60346,L345565,u1767,m117,ELLE,"Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?"
60347,L345564,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,Yes. I was washing my hair.
60348,L345563,u1767,m117,ELLE,"But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower."
60349,L345559,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,I guess.
60350,L345558,u1767,m117,ELLE,"So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?"
60351,L345557,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,No. I was in the shower.
60352,L345556,u1767,m117,ELLE,Did you hear a shot fired?
60353,L345553,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,"No, she'd stashed it by then."
60354,L345552,u1767,m117,ELLE,But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
60355,L345551,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,"I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood."
60356,L345550,u1767,m117,ELLE,"And when you came downstairs, what happened?"
60357,L345549,u1763,m117,CHUTNEY,"Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower."
60358,L345548,u1767,m117,ELLE,"Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?"

60375,L345473,u1765,m117,DONOVAN,I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
60376,L345471,u1765,m117,DONOVAN,"I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it.

60387,L345257,u1767,m117,ELLE,I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!

60391,L345221,u1765,m117,DONOVAN,"That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi."

60667,L345063,u1775,m117,PROFESSOR DONOVAN,"You're applying for my internship, aren't you?"
60668,L345062,u1767,m117,ELLE,I did?
60669,L344963,u1767,m117,ELLE,I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
60670,L344962,u1775,m117,PROFESSOR DONOVAN,Yes? Ms. Woods?
60671,L344959,u1767,m117,ELLE,I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
60672,L344958,u1775,m117,PROFESSOR DONOVAN,Why not?
60673,L344957,u1767,m117,ELLE,Neither.
60674,L344840,u1767,m117,ELLE,I guess it'll have to...
60675,L344839,u1770,m117,FUZZY 2L,There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
60676,L344838,u1767,m117,ELLE,"You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips."
60677,L344837,u1770,m117,FUZZY 2L,Your what?
60678,L344836,u1767,m117,ELLE,Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
60679,L344835,u1770,m117,FUZZY 2L,"Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck."
60680,L344834,u1767,m117,ELLE,Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
60681,L344833,u1770,m117,FUZZY 2L,"Class schedule, map, book list."
60682,L345614,u1767,m117,ELLE,Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
60683,L345613,u1779,m117,WARNER,Are you serious?
60684,L345612,u1767,m117,ELLE,In court. On opposing sides.
60685,L345609,u1767,m117,ELLE,Really?
60686,L345608,u1779,m117,WARNER,It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
60687,L345437,u1779,m117,WARNER,How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
60688,L345436,u1767,m117,ELLE,Thanks for the backup.
60689,L345427,u1767,m117,ELLE,See?
60690,L345426,u1779,m117,WARNER,Pink ones.
60691,L345267,u1767,m117,ELLE,"I gave her my word, Warner."
60692,L345266,u1779,m117,WARNER,"If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself."
60693,L345116,u1767,m117,ELLE,Thank you.
60694,L345115,u1779,m117,WARNER,You look -- nice.
60695,L345024,u1779,m117,WARNER,I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
60696,L345023,u1767,m117,ELLE,"But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --"
60697,L345022,u1779,m117,WARNER,"Well, yeah, but --"
60698,L345021,u1767,m117,ELLE,"Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?"
60699,L345020,u1779,m117,WARNER,I didn't mean --
60700,L345019,u1779,m117,WARNER,"Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough."
60701,L345018,u1767,m117,ELLE,Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
60702,L345017,u1779,m117,WARNER,That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
60703,L345016,u1767,m117,ELLE,I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
60704,L345015,u1779,m117,WARNER,Now I am.
60705,L345014,u1767,m117,ELLE,Thank you. Having fun?
60706,L345013,u1779,m117,WARNER,Wow. You're a walking felony.
60707,L344922,u1779,m117,WARNER,Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
60708,L344921,u1767,m117,ELLE,"I'm sorry, I just hallucinated."

60710,L344914,u1779,m117,WARNER,Good. Good.
60711,L344913,u1767,m117,ELLE,Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
60712,L344912,u1779,m117,WARNER,So -- uh -- how was your first class?
60713,L344864,u1779,m117,WARNER,Uh -- sure.
60714,L344863,u1767,m117,ELLE,Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
60715,L344862,u1767,m117,ELLE,"What, like it's that hard?"
60716,L344861,u1779,m117,WARNER,You got into Harvard Law?
60717,L344860,u1767,m117,ELLE,Harvard. Law school.
60718,L344859,u1779,m117,WARNER,You go where?
60719,L344858,u1767,m117,ELLE,"No, silly. I go here."
60720,L344857,u1779,m117,WARNER,What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
60721,L344715,u1767,m117,ELLE,I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
60722,L344714,u1779,m117,WARNER,"I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious."
60723,L344713,u1767,m117,ELLE,"Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --"
60724,L344712,u1779,m117,WARNER,East coast people are different.
60725,L344711,u1767,m117,ELLE,So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
60726,L344710,u1779,m117,WARNER,I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
60727,L344709,u1767,m117,ELLE,How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
60728,L344708,u1779,m117,WARNER,"Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do."
60729,L344707,u1779,m117,WARNER,Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
60730,L344706,u1767,m117,ELLE,No.
60731,L344705,u1779,m117,WARNER,C'mon. Let me take you home.
60732,L344701,u1779,m117,WARNER,Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
60733,L344700,u1767,m117,ELLE,Then what? My boobs are too big?
60734,L344699,u1779,m117,WARNER,That's not entirely --
60735,L344698,u1767,m117,ELLE,You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
60736,L344697,u1779,m117,WARNER,"Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn."
60737,L344696,u1767,m117,ELLE,You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
60738,L344695,u1779,m117,WARNER,"I'm sorry, Elle, I just --"
60739,L344692,u1779,m117,WARNER,That's why I think it's time for us to --
60740,L344691,u1767,m117,ELLE,I completely agree.
60741,L344690,u1779,m117,WARNER,"But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around."
60742,L344689,u1767,m117,ELLE,And I fully support that.
60743,L344688,u1779,m117,WARNER,My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
60744,L344687,u1767,m117,ELLE,Of course.
60745,L344686,u1779,m117,WARNER,"I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious."
60746,L344685,u1767,m117,ELLE,I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
60747,L344680,u1767,m117,ELLE,So are you!
60748,L344679,u1779,m117,WARNER,You're beautiful.
60749,L345450,u1769,m117,ENRIQUE,Chuck.
60750,L345449,u1768,m117,EMMETT,And what is your boyfriend's name?
60751,L345448,u1769,m117,ENRIQUE,Three months.
60752,L345447,u1768,m117,EMMETT,And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
60753,L345446,u1769,m117,ENRIQUE,A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
60754,L345445,u1768,m117,EMMETT,Where?
60755,L345444,u1769,m117,ENRIQUE,Yes.
60756,L345443,u1768,m117,EMMETT,Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
60757,L345315,u1773,m117,MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK,"I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it."
60758,L345314,u1768,m117,EMMETT,Hovering?
60759,L345311,u1773,m117,MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK,Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
60760,L345310,u1768,m117,EMMETT,Why do you say that?
60761,L345309,u1773,m117,MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK,But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
60762,L345308,u1768,m117,EMMETT,"I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it."
60763,L345307,u1773,m117,MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK,Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
60764,L345304,u1773,m117,MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK,"I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --"
60765,L345303,u1768,m117,EMMETT,"Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?"
60766,L345302,u1773,m117,MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK,"So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth."
60767,L345300,u1773,m117,MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK,I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
60768,L345299,u1768,m117,EMMETT,She's naked.
60769,L344804,u1772,m117,MARGOT,Pull up next to him!
60770,L344803,u1778,m117,SERENA,There he is!
60771,L344791,u1772,m117,MARGOT,"Yeah, luckily."
60772,L344790,u1778,m117,SERENA,You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
60773,L344783,u1778,m117,SERENA,"I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?"
60774,L344782,u1772,m117,MARGOT,Why?!
60775,L344780,u1778,m117,SERENA,Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
60776,L344779,u1772,m117,MARGOT,Let's all go! Road trip!
60777,L344752,u1772,m117,MARGOT,Cunnilingus?
60778,L344751,u1778,m117,SERENA,"What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?"
60779,L344743,u1772,m117,MARGOT,You're right. Phew!
60780,L344742,u1778,m117,SERENA,Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
60781,L344741,u1772,m117,MARGOT,"Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?"
60782,L344725,u1772,m117,MARGOT,It's not a Theta --
60783,L344724,u1778,m117,SERENA,Is it a Kappa?
60784,L344720,u1778,m117,SERENA,Where's the Rock?
60785,L344719,u1772,m117,MARGOT,Elle?
60786,L346420,u1782,m118,BARON,Purely a precaution...
60787,L346419,u1780,m118,1ST DEMON,Fire moat... why do that?
60788,L346418,u1782,m118,BARON,"Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame."
60789,L346417,u1780,m118,1ST DEMON,We come watch... we come watch...
60790,L346412,u1782,m118,BARON,I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
60791,L346411,u1780,m118,1ST DEMON,You go?  Not watch fun?
60792,L346408,u1782,m118,BARON,Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
60793,L346407,u1780,m118,1ST DEMON,Then we smash 'em?
60794,L346406,u1782,m118,BARON,Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
60795,L346385,u1782,m118,BARON,Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
60796,L346384,u1780,m118,1ST DEMON,Fool's magic.
60797,L346381,u1782,m118,BARON,Faith.
60798,L346380,u1780,m118,1ST DEMON,Why so few?
60799,L346416,u1782,m118,BARON,To finish last evening's delightful work.
60800,L346415,u1781,m118,2ND DEMON,You go to lady now?
60801,L346414,u1782,m118,BARON,"This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress."
60802,L346413,u1781,m118,2ND DEMON,More fun win battle?
60803,L346410,u1782,m118,BARON,"Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves."
60804,L346409,u1781,m118,2ND DEMON,We watch... good fun...
60805,L346392,u1782,m118,BARON,"I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch."
60806,L346391,u1781,m118,2ND DEMON,Birdies... pretty...
60807,L346389,u1782,m118,BARON,No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
60808,L346388,u1781,m118,2ND DEMON,"We go out, smash 'em now?"
60809,L346387,u1782,m118,BARON,Always.
60810,L346386,u1781,m118,2ND DEMON,Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
60811,L346383,u1782,m118,BARON,Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
60812,L346382,u1781,m118,2ND DEMON,What?
60813,L346490,u1782,m118,BARON,"So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion."
60814,L346489,u1788,m118,LILI,To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
60815,L346488,u1782,m118,BARON,"Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire."
60816,L346487,u1788,m118,LILI,"Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly."
60817,L346486,u1782,m118,BARON,Or looked so beautiful...
60818,L346485,u1788,m118,LILI,Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
60819,L346484,u1782,m118,BARON,"And, now?"
60820,L346483,u1788,m118,LILI,It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
60821,L346482,u1782,m118,BARON,"Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?"
60822,L346481,u1788,m118,LILI,And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
60823,L346480,u1782,m118,BARON,"Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you..."
60824,L346479,u1788,m118,LILI,"Might we watch, too?"
60825,L346478,u1782,m118,BARON,From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
60826,L346477,u1788,m118,LILI,It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
60827,L346476,u1782,m118,BARON,"It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty."
60828,L346475,u1788,m118,LILI,What was that?  Did you hear that?
60829,L346350,u1782,m118,BARON,"Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!"
60830,L346349,u1788,m118,LILI,You're a beast!
60831,L346348,u1782,m118,BARON,"My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul."
60832,L346347,u1788,m118,LILI,I don't expect you'd understand.
60833,L346346,u1782,m118,BARON,Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
60834,L346345,u1788,m118,LILI,"Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!"
60835,L346344,u1782,m118,BARON,I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
60836,L346343,u1788,m118,LILI,I see...
60837,L346342,u1782,m118,BARON,"When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest."
60838,L346341,u1788,m118,LILI,What will become of me then?
60839,L346340,u1782,m118,BARON,Yes?
60840,L346339,u1788,m118,LILI,And then?
60841,L346338,u1782,m118,BARON,A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
60842,L346337,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh, yes..."
60843,L346336,u1782,m118,BARON,"We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?"
60844,L346335,u1782,m118,BARON,"At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table..."
60845,L346334,u1788,m118,LILI,What do you want from me?
60846,L346333,u1782,m118,BARON,"Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable."
60847,L346332,u1788,m118,LILI,Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
60848,L346331,u1782,m118,BARON,"I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant."
60849,L346330,u1788,m118,LILI,No more... please...
60850,L346329,u1782,m118,BARON,Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
60851,L346328,u1788,m118,LILI,Kill me... I want... so nice...
60852,L346327,u1782,m118,BARON,"Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?"
60853,L346216,u1782,m118,BARON,Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
60854,L346215,u1788,m118,LILI,"Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me..."
60855,L346213,u1782,m118,BARON,No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
60856,L346212,u1788,m118,LILI,Do it now!
60857,L346211,u1782,m118,BARON,"When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!"
60858,L346207,u1782,m118,BARON,"We're both of us damned, my beauty."
60859,L346206,u1788,m118,LILI,Damn you!
60860,L346204,u1788,m118,LILI,I'd soon die.
60861,L346203,u1782,m118,BARON,"To be my bride, of course."
60862,L346202,u1788,m118,LILI,Why have you brought me here?
60863,L346201,u1782,m118,BARON,"I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking."
60864,L346200,u1788,m118,LILI,Do you feed on mice and rats?
60865,L346199,u1782,m118,BARON,"I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl."
60866,L346198,u1788,m118,LILI,Like some vile toadstool.
60867,L346197,u1782,m118,BARON,I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
60868,L346196,u1788,m118,LILI,Protection?
60869,L346195,u1782,m118,BARON,I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
60870,L346194,u1788,m118,LILI,Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
60871,L346193,u1782,m118,BARON,I am afraid of nothing.
60872,L346192,u1788,m118,LILI,And you... are you not also afraid?
60873,L346191,u1782,m118,BARON,"We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it."
60874,L346190,u1788,m118,LILI,You... you're a beast!
60875,L346189,u1782,m118,BARON,"Not from me, surely..."
60876,L346188,u1788,m118,LILI,God protect me.
60877,L346187,u1782,m118,BARON,You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
60878,L346186,u1788,m118,LILI,"You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!"
60879,L346185,u1782,m118,BARON,"On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful."
60880,L346184,u1788,m118,LILI,Grotesque... monstrous...
60881,L346183,u1782,m118,BARON,You're magnificent.
60882,L346182,u1788,m118,LILI,But I'm hideous!
60883,L346181,u1782,m118,BARON,I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
60884,L346180,u1788,m118,LILI,You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
60885,L346179,u1782,m118,BARON,"I speak of love, and you think only of the lash."
60886,L346178,u1788,m118,LILI,Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
60887,L346177,u1782,m118,BARON,Your love.
60888,L346176,u1788,m118,LILI,What do you want with me?
60889,L346175,u1782,m118,BARON,My generosity is not so large as that.
60890,L345926,u1783,m118,DRAGON,"No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!"
60891,L345925,u1785,m118,JACK,"No, wait... please... listen..."
60892,L345923,u1785,m118,JACK,Oh no... Don't you understand?
60893,L345922,u1783,m118,DRAGON,You come stealee tleasoo?
60894,L345921,u1785,m118,JACK,"I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --"
60895,L345920,u1783,m118,DRAGON,An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
60896,L345919,u1785,m118,JACK,It's terrible.
60897,L345918,u1783,m118,DRAGON,Flozen foleva not good.
60898,L345917,u1785,m118,JACK,"Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever."
60899,L345916,u1783,m118,DRAGON,Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
60900,L345915,u1785,m118,JACK,"You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?"
60901,L345914,u1783,m118,DRAGON,You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
60902,L345913,u1785,m118,JACK,East of Mercia?
60903,L345912,u1783,m118,DRAGON,"Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun..."
60904,L345911,u1785,m118,JACK,Cathay?
60905,L345910,u1783,m118,DRAGON,Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
60906,L345909,u1785,m118,JACK,"Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of."
60907,L345908,u1783,m118,DRAGON,"No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?"
60908,L345907,u1785,m118,JACK,"Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind."
60909,L345906,u1783,m118,DRAGON,You come stealee tleasoo?
60910,L345905,u1785,m118,JACK,"I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb."
60911,L345904,u1783,m118,DRAGON,What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
60912,L345903,u1785,m118,JACK,I didn't know... I --
60913,L345902,u1783,m118,DRAGON,"What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep."
60914,L346236,u1789,m118,OGG,There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
60915,L346235,u1784,m118,GUMP,"We be honored, friend Ogg."
60916,L346234,u1789,m118,OGG,Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
60917,L346098,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green."
60918,L346097,u1789,m118,OGG,Who might these friends be?
60919,L346096,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night."
60920,L346095,u1789,m118,OGG,Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
60921,L346094,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Well, bygones're bygones, I always say."
60922,L346093,u1789,m118,OGG,"Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears."
60923,L346092,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you."
60924,L346625,u1784,m118,GUMP,You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
60925,L346624,u1785,m118,JACK,I'll try.
60926,L346623,u1784,m118,GUMP,You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
60927,L346622,u1784,m118,GUMP,That's it then... the ring!
60928,L346621,u1785,m118,JACK,Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
60929,L346620,u1784,m118,GUMP,And did you?
60930,L346619,u1785,m118,JACK,She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
60931,L346618,u1784,m118,GUMP,Go on... go on...
60932,L346617,u1785,m118,JACK,By the pond.  She was teasing me.
60933,L346616,u1784,m118,GUMP,Where?
60934,L346615,u1785,m118,JACK,I was with the Princess.
60935,L346614,u1784,m118,GUMP,Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
60936,L346613,u1785,m118,JACK,I'll do anything... face any challenge!
60937,L346612,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work."
60938,L346611,u1785,m118,JACK,The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
60939,L346607,u1785,m118,JACK,"She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps..."
60940,L346606,u1784,m118,GUMP,She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
60941,L346605,u1785,m118,JACK,Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
60942,L346604,u1784,m118,GUMP,Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
60943,L346603,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
60944,L346602,u1784,m118,GUMP,On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
60945,L346601,u1784,m118,GUMP,Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
60946,L346600,u1785,m118,JACK,"Not in the mood, I'm afraid."
60947,L346599,u1784,m118,GUMP,I've not heard a note out of you.
60948,L346598,u1785,m118,JACK,A good day for singing...
60949,L346583,u1784,m118,GUMP,You're on your own... like a true champion.
60950,L346582,u1785,m118,JACK,He'll not escape me.
60951,L346581,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Ride like wild fire, Jack."
60952,L346575,u1785,m118,JACK,Sapphire!
60953,L346574,u1784,m118,GUMP,Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
60954,L346571,u1785,m118,JACK,I could have struck off his head just now!
60955,L346570,u1784,m118,GUMP,Never show mercy!
60956,L346569,u1785,m118,JACK,He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
60957,L346562,u1785,m118,JACK,Hurry up!
60958,L346561,u1784,m118,GUMP,Don't get too far!
60959,L346560,u1785,m118,JACK,Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
60960,L346557,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!"
60961,L346556,u1785,m118,JACK,Can't we move any faster?
60962,L346552,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway."
60963,L346551,u1785,m118,JACK,Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
60964,L346550,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Patience, lad."
60965,L346549,u1785,m118,JACK,Will you explain what's going on?
60966,L346545,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates."
60967,L346544,u1785,m118,JACK,Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
60968,L346543,u1784,m118,GUMP,Sunlight.
60969,L346542,u1785,m118,JACK,What weapon?
60970,L346541,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron."
60971,L346540,u1785,m118,JACK,Did you bring me here to sup?
60972,L346539,u1784,m118,GUMP,"The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so."
60973,L346537,u1784,m118,GUMP,"I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen."
60974,L346536,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm not afraid of the dark.
60975,L346535,u1784,m118,GUMP,Mean you to seek him out below?
60976,L346534,u1785,m118,JACK,"Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!"
60977,L346533,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Sunlight, you say?"
60978,L346532,u1785,m118,JACK,"Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key."
60979,L346531,u1784,m118,GUMP,"In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?"
60980,L346530,u1785,m118,JACK,"The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock..."
60981,L346529,u1784,m118,GUMP,"The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed."
60982,L346528,u1785,m118,JACK,I don't... understand.
60983,L346527,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war."
60984,L346526,u1785,m118,JACK,Can you save her?
60985,L346525,u1784,m118,GUMP,Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
60986,L346524,u1785,m118,JACK,The wound is mortal.
60987,L346523,u1784,m118,GUMP,"She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet."
60988,L346522,u1785,m118,JACK,... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
60989,L346521,u1784,m118,GUMP,Nonsense!  Course it matters.
60990,L346520,u1785,m118,JACK,It doesn't matter.
60991,L346519,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad."
60992,L346465,u1784,m118,GUMP,It's what we'll find there worries me.
60993,L346464,u1785,m118,JACK,Aye.  We're good as inside.
60994,L346463,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Best get down close to the moat, lad."
60995,L346462,u1785,m118,JACK,He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
60996,L346454,u1784,m118,GUMP,Fire away!
60997,L346453,u1785,m118,JACK,"Then it's Godspeed, Screwball."
60998,L346452,u1784,m118,GUMP,Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
60999,L346451,u1785,m118,JACK,Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
61000,L346450,u1784,m118,GUMP,That's it!
61001,L346449,u1785,m118,JACK,One more turn...
61002,L346435,u1785,m118,JACK,There must be some way to get it up there.
61003,L346434,u1784,m118,GUMP,Will you chance a miss?
61004,L346433,u1785,m118,JACK,"That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge."
61005,L346432,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --"
61006,L346431,u1785,m118,JACK,What magic have we on our side?
61007,L346430,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Been telling you that all along, lad."
61008,L346429,u1785,m118,JACK,There isn't much time!
61009,L346428,u1784,m118,GUMP,"And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic."
61010,L346427,u1785,m118,JACK,Water doesn't burn...
61011,L346404,u1785,m118,JACK,Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
61012,L346403,u1784,m118,GUMP,There aren't enough arrows.
61013,L346402,u1785,m118,JACK,Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
61014,L346401,u1784,m118,GUMP,Easily spoken...
61015,L346400,u1785,m118,JACK,Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
61016,L346399,u1784,m118,GUMP,"A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?"
61017,L346375,u1785,m118,JACK,We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
61018,L346374,u1784,m118,GUMP,Why not mine the damned walls?
61019,L346373,u1785,m118,JACK,We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
61020,L346372,u1784,m118,GUMP,Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
61021,L346370,u1784,m118,GUMP,Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
61022,L346369,u1785,m118,JACK,On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
61023,L346368,u1784,m118,GUMP,"That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack."
61024,L346363,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait."
61025,L346362,u1785,m118,JACK,There's more than one way to spring a trap.
61026,L346361,u1784,m118,GUMP,"It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap."
61027,L346360,u1785,m118,JACK,Give in to despair and all is lost.
61028,L346357,u1785,m118,JACK,"It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it."
61029,L346356,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Don't like the feel of it, Jack."
61030,L346352,u1785,m118,JACK,The chill is worse this night.
61031,L346351,u1784,m118,GUMP,Never felt so cold in all me born days...
61032,L346324,u1784,m118,GUMP,No... but what choice have we?
61033,L346323,u1785,m118,JACK,Can we trust him?
61034,L346305,u1785,m118,JACK,But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
61035,L346304,u1784,m118,GUMP,Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
61036,L346296,u1784,m118,GUMP,"I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot."
61037,L346295,u1785,m118,JACK,Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
61038,L346294,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!"
61039,L346290,u1785,m118,JACK,Nay.  This time we strike first!
61040,L346289,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Wait, Jack."
61041,L346287,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero."
61042,L346286,u1785,m118,JACK,We'll never find the Baron's castle.
61043,L346285,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Long as we don't lose heart, Jack..."
61044,L346284,u1785,m118,JACK,"Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely."
61045,L346275,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Aye, lad... we've little else to go by."
61046,L346274,u1785,m118,JACK,"We'll trust in faith, Gump."
61047,L346273,u1784,m118,GUMP,Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
61048,L346272,u1785,m118,JACK,Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
61049,L346271,u1784,m118,GUMP,Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
61050,L346270,u1785,m118,JACK,We'll find it.
61051,L346269,u1784,m118,GUMP,We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
61052,L346268,u1785,m118,JACK,"No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite."
61053,L346267,u1784,m118,GUMP,Is she... dead?
61054,L346262,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely."
61055,L346261,u1785,m118,JACK,Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
61056,L346256,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Willful creature, that one..."
61057,L346255,u1785,m118,JACK,Wait!
61058,L346249,u1785,m118,JACK,It bodes evil.
61059,L346248,u1784,m118,GUMP,"What make ye of that, Jack?"
61060,L346247,u1785,m118,JACK,"There's the way, mates."
61061,L346246,u1784,m118,GUMP,God's blessing.
61062,L346244,u1784,m118,GUMP,Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
61063,L346243,u1785,m118,JACK,We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
61064,L346242,u1784,m118,GUMP,... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
61065,L346230,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems."
61066,L346229,u1785,m118,JACK,Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
61067,L346140,u1784,m118,GUMP,Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
61068,L346139,u1785,m118,JACK,"God protect you, Honeythorn Gump."
61069,L346138,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack."
61070,L346137,u1785,m118,JACK,"We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons..."
61071,L346136,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck."
61072,L346134,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling."
61073,L346133,u1785,m118,JACK,I pray always to be worthy of it.
61074,L346116,u1785,m118,JACK,"Gump, you're putting words in my mouth."
61075,L346115,u1784,m118,GUMP,I should hope not!
61076,L346112,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it."
61077,L346111,u1785,m118,JACK,Certainly understandable.
61078,L346110,u1784,m118,GUMP,Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
61079,L346109,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye."
61080,L346108,u1785,m118,JACK,Ogg's footprints!
61081,L346107,u1784,m118,GUMP,Something the matter?
61082,L346106,u1785,m118,JACK,My God!  Look!
61083,L346089,u1784,m118,GUMP,Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
61084,L346088,u1785,m118,JACK,Nice piece of work.
61085,L346083,u1785,m118,JACK,Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
61086,L346082,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited."
61087,L346081,u1785,m118,JACK,Better to kill than be disturbed.
61088,L346080,u1784,m118,GUMP,Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
61089,L346079,u1785,m118,JACK,And this?  Some of their handiwork?
61090,L346078,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do."
61091,L346077,u1785,m118,JACK,I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
61092,L346076,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking."
61093,L346075,u1785,m118,JACK,Twould appear other travelers precede us.
61094,L346074,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown."
61095,L346073,u1785,m118,JACK,Good.
61096,L346070,u1784,m118,GUMP,That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
61097,L346069,u1785,m118,JACK,Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
61098,L346065,u1785,m118,JACK,Stealing his arms?
61099,L346064,u1784,m118,GUMP,Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
61100,L346063,u1785,m118,JACK,There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
61101,L346062,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow..."
61102,L346061,u1785,m118,JACK,What know you of fields of war?
61103,L346060,u1784,m118,GUMP,Worse than the battlefield.
61104,L346056,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Jack, don't!"
61105,L346055,u1785,m118,JACK,The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
61106,L346054,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir."
61107,L346053,u1785,m118,JACK,Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
61108,L346052,u1784,m118,GUMP,Blackheart?
61109,L346051,u1785,m118,JACK,This is ogre's magic.
61110,L346036,u1784,m118,GUMP,Good plan that.
61111,L346035,u1785,m118,JACK,Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
61112,L346034,u1784,m118,GUMP,How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
61113,L346022,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!"
61114,L346021,u1785,m118,JACK,Beware.
61115,L346020,u1784,m118,GUMP,Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
61116,L346019,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
61117,L346018,u1784,m118,GUMP,Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
61118,L346017,u1785,m118,JACK,"Jenny Greenteeth said:  ""Follow the raven in her flight..."""
61119,L346016,u1784,m118,GUMP,Whatever for?
61120,L346015,u1785,m118,JACK,We must follow that bird.
61121,L346010,u1785,m118,JACK,Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
61122,L346009,u1784,m118,GUMP,Track the demon to his lair.
61123,L346008,u1785,m118,JACK,"A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail."
61124,L346007,u1784,m118,GUMP,"How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?"
61125,L346006,u1785,m118,JACK,We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
61126,L346005,u1784,m118,GUMP,Fine-looking army.
61127,L346004,u1785,m118,JACK,Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
61128,L346003,u1784,m118,GUMP,I'll drop a cow on the knave!
61129,L346002,u1785,m118,JACK,You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
61130,L346001,u1784,m118,GUMP,Aye!  That too.
61131,L346000,u1785,m118,JACK,Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
61132,L345999,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk."
61133,L345998,u1785,m118,JACK,"We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump."
61134,L345997,u1784,m118,GUMP,I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
61135,L345996,u1785,m118,JACK,The colt's still too small.
61136,L345995,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!"
61137,L345975,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Careful, lad."
61138,L345974,u1785,m118,JACK,Damn them!
61139,L345969,u1785,m118,JACK,It would appear so.
61140,L345968,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Pregnant, is she?"
61141,L345965,u1784,m118,GUMP,Something's coming.
61142,L345964,u1785,m118,JACK,What is it?
61143,L345955,u1784,m118,GUMP,Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
61144,L345954,u1785,m118,JACK,Shhhh!
61145,L345947,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed."
61146,L345946,u1785,m118,JACK,I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
61147,L345943,u1784,m118,GUMP,"No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit."
61148,L345942,u1785,m118,JACK,By the grace of God.
61149,L345938,u1785,m118,JACK,Better we eat him than the other way round.
61150,L345937,u1784,m118,GUMP,"There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad."
61151,L345898,u1784,m118,GUMP,"You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps."
61152,L345897,u1785,m118,JACK,What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
61153,L345896,u1784,m118,GUMP,"There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up."
61154,L345895,u1785,m118,JACK,You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
61155,L345894,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack."
61156,L345893,u1785,m118,JACK,Knaves and robbers...
61157,L345892,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep..."
61158,L345891,u1785,m118,JACK,"So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?"
61159,L345890,u1784,m118,GUMP,No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
61160,L345889,u1785,m118,JACK,And who might that be?
61161,L345888,u1784,m118,GUMP,"A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now."
61162,L345887,u1785,m118,JACK,"Have we turned grave-robber, then?"
61163,L345886,u1784,m118,GUMP,"There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep."
61164,L345885,u1784,m118,GUMP,I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
61165,L345884,u1785,m118,JACK,"Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?"
61166,L345883,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough."
61167,L345882,u1785,m118,JACK,"I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!"
61168,L345881,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?"
61169,L345880,u1785,m118,JACK,If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
61170,L345879,u1784,m118,GUMP,Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
61171,L345878,u1785,m118,JACK,Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
61172,L345877,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now."
61173,L345876,u1785,m118,JACK,The princess is dead.
61174,L345828,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona."
61175,L345827,u1785,m118,JACK,And if she thinks me a liar?
61176,L345826,u1784,m118,GUMP,Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
61177,L345825,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb."
61178,L345824,u1785,m118,JACK,What do I do?
61179,L345823,u1784,m118,GUMP,Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
61180,L345822,u1785,m118,JACK,Are we here?
61181,L345820,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry."
61182,L345819,u1785,m118,JACK,Will you lead me to her?
61183,L345818,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek."
61184,L345817,u1785,m118,JACK,How is it this hag knows the truth?
61185,L345816,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them."
61186,L345815,u1785,m118,JACK,Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
61187,L345814,u1784,m118,GUMP,"True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth."
61188,L345813,u1785,m118,JACK,There must be an answer somewhere.
61189,L345812,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?"
61190,L345811,u1785,m118,JACK,Don't you care about what's happened?
61191,L345810,u1784,m118,GUMP,"If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere."
61192,L345809,u1785,m118,JACK,"Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?"
61193,L345808,u1784,m118,GUMP,"That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers."
61194,L345806,u1784,m118,GUMP,"If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee..."
61195,L345805,u1785,m118,JACK,Don't you know?
61196,L345804,u1784,m118,GUMP,Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
61197,L345803,u1785,m118,JACK,"Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?"
61198,L345802,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Big question that, lad.  Why what?"
61199,L345801,u1785,m118,JACK,"But... but, why?"
61200,L345799,u1784,m118,GUMP,He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
61201,L345798,u1785,m118,JACK,Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
61202,L345797,u1784,m118,GUMP,Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
61203,L345796,u1785,m118,JACK,"Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --"
61204,L345795,u1784,m118,GUMP,Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
61205,L345794,u1785,m118,JACK,"It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic..."
61206,L345793,u1784,m118,GUMP,Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
61207,L345791,u1785,m118,JACK,What does she want from me?
61208,L345790,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time."
61209,L345783,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones."
61210,L345782,u1785,m118,JACK,I fear she's lost.
61211,L345781,u1784,m118,GUMP,"I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack."
61212,L345780,u1785,m118,JACK,"Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?"
61213,L345779,u1784,m118,GUMP,"You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much."
61214,L345778,u1785,m118,JACK,"I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks."
61215,L345777,u1784,m118,GUMP,"You be our guest, Jack."
61216,L345776,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have."
61217,L345775,u1785,m118,JACK,A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
61218,L345774,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack."
61219,L345773,u1785,m118,JACK,The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
61220,L345772,u1784,m118,GUMP,What!
61221,L345771,u1785,m118,JACK,It's bluebells!
61222,L345768,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming."
61223,L345767,u1785,m118,JACK,And if I cannot?
61224,L345766,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven."
61225,L345765,u1785,m118,JACK,I meant no disrespect.
61226,L345764,u1784,m118,GUMP,"You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad."
61227,L345763,u1785,m118,JACK,No... I... I need to rest.
61228,L345762,u1784,m118,GUMP,And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
61229,L345761,u1785,m118,JACK,Enough!
61230,L345758,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun."
61231,L345757,u1785,m118,JACK,No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
61232,L345754,u1784,m118,GUMP,To be sure.
61233,L345753,u1785,m118,JACK,Faerie ring?
61234,L345752,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?"
61235,L345751,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm in no mood for dancing.
61236,L345750,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance."
61237,L345749,u1785,m118,JACK,"Gump, is it?"
61238,L345748,u1784,m118,GUMP,"So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump."
61239,L346568,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Sorry.
61240,L346567,u1784,m118,GUMP,Dolt!
61241,L346547,u1784,m118,GUMP,They'll do nicely.
61242,L346546,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,How're these?
61243,L346448,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow..."
61244,L346447,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,"Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself..."
61245,L346446,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it."
61246,L346441,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you."
61247,L346440,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Aye... my Lord...
61248,L346439,u1784,m118,GUMP,You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
61249,L346438,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
61250,L346426,u1784,m118,GUMP,They've fired the moat!
61251,L346425,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Sweet slippers of Oisin!
61252,L346424,u1784,m118,GUMP,Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
61253,L346423,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
61254,L346266,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Three cheers for our champion.
61255,L346265,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Well done, lad."
61256,L346104,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Gonna make ogre-stew!
61257,L346103,u1784,m118,GUMP,We seek to undo the curse.
61258,L346072,u1784,m118,GUMP,Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
61259,L346071,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
61260,L346048,u1784,m118,GUMP,These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
61261,L346047,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,You see!  You see!
61262,L346040,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,"No, no, no... this is different!"
61263,L346039,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Barely living, from the looks of it."
61264,L345982,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,"Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!"
61265,L345981,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Well done, lad.  Stout heart."
61266,L345941,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,"Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack."
61267,L345940,u1784,m118,GUMP,"Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well."
61268,L345939,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,"Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm."
61269,L346655,u1785,m118,JACK,"Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts."
61270,L346654,u1788,m118,LILI,Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
61271,L346653,u1785,m118,JACK,Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
61272,L346652,u1788,m118,LILI,I can't see a thing.
61273,L346651,u1785,m118,JACK,Everywhere!  Ow!
61274,L346650,u1788,m118,LILI,Pinching?  Where?
61275,L346649,u1785,m118,JACK,Pinching me!
61276,L346648,u1788,m118,LILI,Biting you?
61277,L346647,u1785,m118,JACK,Ouch!  Something's biting me.
61278,L346646,u1788,m118,LILI,What's the matter?
61279,L346644,u1788,m118,LILI,"And I love you, my husband."
61280,L346643,u1785,m118,JACK,Lili... I love you!
61281,L346642,u1788,m118,LILI,"You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!"
61282,L346641,u1785,m118,JACK,"But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body."
61283,L346640,u1788,m118,LILI,"Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other."
61284,L346639,u1785,m118,JACK,You're teasing still.
61285,L346638,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word."
61286,L346637,u1785,m118,JACK,Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
61287,L346636,u1788,m118,LILI,Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
61288,L346635,u1785,m118,JACK,I can't have been under much more than a minute.
61289,L346634,u1788,m118,LILI,Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
61290,L346633,u1785,m118,JACK,"Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring."
61291,L346632,u1788,m118,LILI,Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
61292,L346518,u1788,m118,LILI,And I... love you...
61293,L346517,u1785,m118,JACK,No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
61294,L346516,u1788,m118,LILI,In the dark... where I join him...
61295,L346515,u1785,m118,JACK,"So, he's hiding in the dark..."
61296,L346514,u1788,m118,LILI,That's why he goes masked during the day...
61297,L346513,u1785,m118,JACK,Sunlight?
61298,L346512,u1788,m118,LILI,Sunlight... It destroys him.
61299,L346511,u1785,m118,JACK,What?
61300,L346510,u1788,m118,LILI,"No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light..."
61301,L346509,u1785,m118,JACK,It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
61302,L346508,u1788,m118,LILI,"You've freed me, Jack..."
61303,L346507,u1785,m118,JACK,No!  I won't let it happen...
61304,L346505,u1785,m118,JACK,They told me you were dead.
61305,L346504,u1788,m118,LILI,I was bewitched... it's better this way...
61306,L346503,u1785,m118,JACK,I thought you were dead... I --
61307,L346502,u1788,m118,LILI,Only what's right...
61308,L346501,u1785,m118,JACK,What have I done?
61309,L346500,u1788,m118,LILI,Jack... Forgive me...
61310,L346499,u1785,m118,JACK,Lili!  No!
61311,L345741,u1785,m118,JACK,What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
61312,L345740,u1788,m118,LILI,"Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?"
61313,L345739,u1785,m118,JACK,If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
61314,L345738,u1788,m118,LILI,"Then, perchance you'll me."
61315,L345737,u1785,m118,JACK,I have no wife.
61316,L345736,u1788,m118,LILI,"Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?"
61317,L345735,u1785,m118,JACK,Tis not fit for a princess.
61318,L345734,u1788,m118,LILI,Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
61319,L345733,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm afraid it may storm.
61320,L345731,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh, la..."
61321,L345730,u1785,m118,JACK,My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
61322,L345729,u1788,m118,LILI,"Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions."
61323,L345728,u1785,m118,JACK,My lady mocks me.
61324,L345727,u1788,m118,LILI,"If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?"
61325,L345726,u1785,m118,JACK,There's no happier thought under heaven.
61326,L345725,u1788,m118,LILI,A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
61327,L345724,u1785,m118,JACK,Tis the truth.
61328,L345723,u1788,m118,LILI,"Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so."
61329,L345722,u1785,m118,JACK,Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
61330,L345720,u1785,m118,JACK,Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
61331,L345719,u1788,m118,LILI,I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
61332,L345718,u1785,m118,JACK,Its powers are strong.
61333,L345717,u1788,m118,LILI,I don't want it on me.
61334,L345716,u1785,m118,JACK,There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
61335,L345715,u1785,m118,JACK,Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
61336,L345714,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh, yes, and the mare with him."
61337,L345713,u1785,m118,JACK,He did run?
61338,L345712,u1788,m118,LILI,It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
61339,L345711,u1785,m118,JACK,How bad was the unicorn's wound?
61340,L345710,u1788,m118,LILI,My own father...
61341,L345709,u1785,m118,JACK,They tricked you.
61342,L345708,u1788,m118,LILI,I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
61343,L345707,u1785,m118,JACK,"Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!"
61344,L345706,u1788,m118,LILI,My father and the Baron.
61345,L345705,u1785,m118,JACK,Who?
61346,L345704,u1788,m118,LILI,I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
61347,L345703,u1785,m118,JACK,What happened?
61348,L345700,u1785,m118,JACK,To fetch your napkin.
61349,L345699,u1788,m118,LILI,Where are you going?
61350,L345698,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
61351,L345697,u1788,m118,LILI,I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
61352,L345696,u1785,m118,JACK,Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
61353,L345695,u1788,m118,LILI,He'll not flee if I show myself?
61354,L345694,u1785,m118,JACK,Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
61355,L345693,u1788,m118,LILI,Jack!
61356,L345692,u1785,m118,JACK,Are you honest?
61357,L345691,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so."
61358,L345690,u1785,m118,JACK,They rival the angels of paradise.
61359,L345689,u1788,m118,LILI,Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
61360,L345686,u1785,m118,JACK,In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
61361,L345685,u1788,m118,LILI,I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
61362,L345684,u1785,m118,JACK,Shhh!
61363,L345683,u1788,m118,LILI,How much longer?
61364,L345679,u1785,m118,JACK,"Your command is my wish, Princess Lili."
61365,L345678,u1788,m118,LILI,The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
61366,L345677,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm not its master.
61367,L345676,u1788,m118,LILI,Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
61368,L345675,u1785,m118,JACK,I'll go search for it.
61369,L345674,u1788,m118,LILI,I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
61370,L345673,u1785,m118,JACK,What's the matter?
61371,L345672,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh, dear."
61372,L345671,u1785,m118,JACK,Be patient.
61373,L345670,u1788,m118,LILI,What shall we do?
61374,L345669,u1785,m118,JACK,That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
61375,L345668,u1788,m118,LILI,I detest serpents.
61376,L345667,u1785,m118,JACK,Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
61377,L345666,u1788,m118,LILI,A gentleman would offer water.
61378,L345665,u1785,m118,JACK,Stop complaining.
61379,L345664,u1788,m118,LILI,Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
61380,L345663,u1785,m118,JACK,All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
61381,L345662,u1788,m118,LILI,A promise is a sacred oath.
61382,L345661,u1785,m118,JACK,Unicorn?
61383,L345660,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?"
61384,L345659,u1785,m118,JACK,Blackheart.  Aptly named.
61385,L345658,u1788,m118,LILI,The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
61386,L345657,u1785,m118,JACK,"Sport, indeed."
61387,L345656,u1788,m118,LILI,"It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport."
61388,L345655,u1785,m118,JACK,Or perchance...
61389,L345654,u1788,m118,LILI,Liar!
61390,L345653,u1785,m118,JACK,I may have said perhaps...
61391,L345652,u1788,m118,LILI,But you did... you did!
61392,L345651,u1785,m118,JACK,Never.
61393,L345650,u1788,m118,LILI,You promised!
61394,L345648,u1788,m118,LILI,If you like.
61395,L345647,u1785,m118,JACK,These for me?
61396,L345646,u1788,m118,LILI,"Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so."
61397,L345645,u1785,m118,JACK,"Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored."
61398,L346128,u1789,m118,OGG,"Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work."
61399,L346127,u1785,m118,JACK,Sigurd's sword...
61400,L346114,u1785,m118,JACK,His feet shall never cross my lips.
61401,L346113,u1789,m118,OGG,Step lively now!
61402,L346102,u1789,m118,OGG,Thought the weather terrible of late.
61403,L346101,u1785,m118,JACK,"We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter."
61404,L346100,u1789,m118,OGG,"Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?"
61405,L346099,u1785,m118,JACK,Honored to make your acquaintance.
61406,L345875,u1786,m118,JENNY,"What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue."
61407,L345874,u1785,m118,JACK,As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
61408,L345873,u1786,m118,JENNY,You'll visit again?
61409,L345872,u1785,m118,JACK,Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
61410,L345871,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer."
61411,L345870,u1785,m118,JACK,"This is sad news, be it true."
61412,L345869,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not."
61413,L345868,u1785,m118,JACK,I don't believe you.
61414,L345867,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Dead, dead, dead."
61415,L345866,u1785,m118,JACK,No!
61416,L345865,u1786,m118,JENNY,She's dead!
61417,L345864,u1785,m118,JACK,Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
61418,L345863,u1786,m118,JENNY,As fair as me?
61419,L345862,u1785,m118,JACK,Exceeding fair.
61420,L345861,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Is she fair, this princess?"
61421,L345860,u1785,m118,JACK,"Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her."
61422,L345859,u1786,m118,JENNY,Princess?  I know of no princess.
61423,L345858,u1785,m118,JACK,What became of the princess?
61424,L345857,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Ask away, sweet man."
61425,L345856,u1785,m118,JACK,Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
61426,L345855,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map."
61427,L345854,u1785,m118,JACK,Not very precise directions.
61428,L345853,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night..."
61429,L345852,u1785,m118,JACK,Where do I find the Baron's castle?
61430,L345851,u1786,m118,JENNY,"You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury."
61431,L345850,u1785,m118,JACK,How do I get the horn back?
61432,L345849,u1786,m118,JENNY,That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
61433,L345848,u1785,m118,JACK,He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
61434,L345847,u1786,m118,JENNY,Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
61435,L345846,u1785,m118,JACK,Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
61436,L345845,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us."
61437,L345844,u1785,m118,JACK,A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
61438,L345843,u1785,m118,JACK,"Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world."
61439,L345842,u1785,m118,JACK,"Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely."
61440,L345841,u1786,m118,JENNY,"I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world."
61441,L345840,u1785,m118,JACK,The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
61442,L345839,u1786,m118,JENNY,"The moon is too round of face, methinks."
61443,L345838,u1785,m118,JACK,The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
61444,L345837,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Think me fair, do you, Jack?"
61445,L345836,u1785,m118,JACK,Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
61446,L345835,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks."
61447,L345834,u1785,m118,JACK,"They call me Green Jack, ma'am."
61448,L345833,u1786,m118,JENNY,"Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?"
61449,L345832,u1785,m118,JACK,I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
61450,L345831,u1786,m118,JENNY,What's this now?
61451,L346252,u1790,m118,OONA,"True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net."
61452,L346251,u1785,m118,JACK,Heading north still?
61453,L346250,u1790,m118,OONA,Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
61454,L346226,u1790,m118,OONA,"You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!"
61455,L346225,u1785,m118,JACK,"Be fair, Oona."
61456,L346224,u1790,m118,OONA,"I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter."
61457,L346223,u1785,m118,JACK,And as barren of love as stone.
61458,L346222,u1790,m118,OONA,"What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!"
61459,L346221,u1785,m118,JACK,Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
61460,L346220,u1790,m118,OONA,Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
61461,L346219,u1785,m118,JACK,Please...
61462,L346218,u1790,m118,OONA,You... you... you mortal you!
61463,L346217,u1785,m118,JACK,"Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't..."
61464,L346167,u1790,m118,OONA,What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
61465,L346166,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm promised to another!
61466,L346165,u1790,m118,OONA,A faerie's love makes anything possible.
61467,L346164,u1785,m118,JACK,"Nay, Oona, tis not possible."
61468,L346163,u1790,m118,OONA,"Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack."
61469,L346162,u1785,m118,JACK,Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
61470,L346161,u1790,m118,OONA,And sweet?
61471,L346160,u1785,m118,JACK,You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
61472,L346159,u1790,m118,OONA,"Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag."
61473,L346158,u1785,m118,JACK,How so?
61474,L346157,u1790,m118,OONA,Jest with me then.
61475,L346156,u1785,m118,JACK,That was in jest.
61476,L346155,u1790,m118,OONA,Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
61477,L346154,u1785,m118,JACK,Wondrously so.
61478,L346153,u1790,m118,OONA,And am I not fair?
61479,L346152,u1785,m118,JACK,In every way.
61480,L346151,u1790,m118,OONA,"Do I not please you, Jack?"
61481,L346150,u1785,m118,JACK,"I had no thought of offending you, Oona."
61482,L346149,u1790,m118,OONA,Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
61483,L346148,u1785,m118,JACK,"And charmed, of course."
61484,L346147,u1790,m118,OONA,Only that?
61485,L346146,u1785,m118,JACK,I'd be honored.
61486,L346145,u1790,m118,OONA,"I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?"
61487,L346144,u1785,m118,JACK,I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
61488,L346143,u1790,m118,OONA,"Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night."
61489,L346142,u1785,m118,JACK,Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
61490,L345992,u1785,m118,JACK,No fear of that now.
61491,L345991,u1790,m118,OONA,"Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it."
61492,L345985,u1790,m118,OONA,"No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye."
61493,L345984,u1785,m118,JACK,Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
61494,L345983,u1790,m118,OONA,"Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you."
61495,L345959,u1790,m118,OONA,Sorry.
61496,L345958,u1785,m118,JACK,This is not the time for squabbling.
61497,L345900,u1785,m118,JACK,I pray God grants it me.
61498,L345899,u1790,m118,OONA,"Courage, Jack."
61499,L346627,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
61500,L346626,u1785,m118,JACK,"Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends."
61501,L346573,u1785,m118,JACK,It's done... we'll never catch him.
61502,L346572,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,"Sorry, Jack."
61503,L346472,u1785,m118,JACK,Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
61504,L346471,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,"Hello, Jack."
61505,L346444,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
61506,L346443,u1785,m118,JACK,Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
61507,L346442,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
61508,L346085,u1785,m118,JACK,Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
61509,L346084,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,What care the bones when the soul is free?
61510,L346067,u1785,m118,JACK,"His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it."
61511,L346066,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
61512,L346045,u1785,m118,JACK,"Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft."
61513,L346044,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Up ahead!
61514,L346043,u1785,m118,JACK,Where?
61515,L346038,u1785,m118,JACK,Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
61516,L346037,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
61517,L345990,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Small miracles better than no miracles...
61518,L345989,u1785,m118,JACK,Praise be to God.
61519,L345980,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
61520,L345979,u1785,m118,JACK,"I'm in your debt, Screwball."
61521,L345967,u1785,m118,JACK,I think she's about to foal.
61522,L345966,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,What's she doing?
61523,L345961,u1785,m118,JACK,We wait.
61524,L345960,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,What do we do now?
61525,L345949,u1785,m118,JACK,"I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head."
61526,L345948,u1791,m118,SCREWBALL,The fastest in the world.
61527,L346238,u1792,m118,THURGIS,May God protect you.
61528,L346237,u1785,m118,JACK,You're with us in battle.
61529,L346131,u1792,m118,THURGIS,"You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms..."
61530,L346130,u1785,m118,JACK,Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
61531,L346129,u1792,m118,THURGIS,Uhm... fine work.
61532,L346126,u1792,m118,THURGIS,Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
61533,L346125,u1785,m118,JACK,The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
61534,L346122,u1785,m118,JACK,I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
61535,L346121,u1792,m118,THURGIS,How came you by this blade?
61536,L346120,u1785,m118,JACK,"Oh, but I have."
61537,L346119,u1792,m118,THURGIS,Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
61538,L346367,u1785,m118,JACK,Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
61539,L346366,u1787,m118,JIMMY,In a dream.
61540,L346365,u1785,m118,JACK,You've been inside?
61541,L346364,u1787,m118,JIMMY,Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
61542,L346355,u1787,m118,JIMMY,Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
61543,L346354,u1785,m118,JACK,A castle's but stone and mortar --
61544,L346353,u1787,m118,JIMMY,It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
61545,L346322,u1787,m118,JIMMY,You follow.
61546,L346321,u1785,m118,JACK,"Let that be our problem, just get us there."
61547,L346318,u1787,m118,JIMMY,That very nice.
61548,L346317,u1785,m118,JACK,"There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry."
61549,L346316,u1787,m118,JIMMY,To Castle Couer de Noir?
61550,L346315,u1785,m118,JACK,Can you show us the way?
61551,L346312,u1785,m118,JACK,You do know where it is?
61552,L346311,u1787,m118,JIMMY,Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
61553,L346310,u1785,m118,JACK,"Simple as that, eh?"
61554,L346308,u1787,m118,JIMMY,Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
61555,L346307,u1785,m118,JACK,"Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest..."
61556,L346306,u1787,m118,JIMMY,Lost?
61557,L346303,u1787,m118,JIMMY,"The Black Baron, you say?"
61558,L346302,u1785,m118,JACK,"Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir."
61559,L346300,u1787,m118,JIMMY,"Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all..."
61560,L346299,u1785,m118,JACK,"Is he a friend, then?"
61561,L346293,u1785,m118,JACK,I'm sending you back to Hell!
61562,L346292,u1787,m118,JIMMY,"No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir..."
61563,L349972,u1793,m119,ADAM,"With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!"
61564,L349971,u1805,m119,RYAN,We did a lot of the wiring too.
61565,L349970,u1793,m119,ADAM,And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
61566,L349774,u1805,m119,RYAN,He was there and then he wasn't!
61567,L349773,u1793,m119,ADAM,Dad's disappeared!
61568,L348950,u1793,m119,ADAM,I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
61569,L348949,u1805,m119,RYAN,What are you doing?
61570,L348948,u1793,m119,ADAM,Marco!
61571,L350031,u1804,m119,ROBIN,It's so beautiful.
61572,L350030,u1793,m119,ADAM,When does George get to come see his house?
61573,L349763,u1793,m119,ADAM,I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
61574,L349762,u1804,m119,ROBIN,He's here.  Check the bathroom.
61575,L349761,u1793,m119,ADAM,He's not there.
61576,L349753,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I guess it depends on what you give up on.
61577,L349752,u1793,m119,ADAM,"That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?"
61578,L349664,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Home after.  Will you come in and say ""hi""?"
61579,L349663,u1793,m119,ADAM,And video games after!
61580,L349538,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Since seventh grade.
61581,L349537,u1793,m119,ADAM,Did you know him before you knew Dad?
61582,L349511,u1793,m119,ADAM,Sam!
61583,L349510,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
61584,L349467,u1793,m119,ADAM,We can work.
61585,L349466,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work."
61586,L349465,u1793,m119,ADAM,I wanna be with you today.
61587,L349464,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
61588,L349461,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I thought I might stop by.
61589,L349460,u1793,m119,ADAM,Are you going to see Sam again?
61590,L350023,u1793,m119,ADAM,I love red!  That's my favorite color!
61591,L350022,u1806,m119,SAM,Red.
61592,L350021,u1793,m119,ADAM,What color?
61593,L350020,u1806,m119,SAM,Do you guys feel like painting?
61594,L349776,u1793,m119,ADAM,Who are you?
61595,L349775,u1806,m119,SAM,He hasn't called?
61596,L349600,u1793,m119,ADAM,I don't think Dad wants you home.
61597,L349599,u1806,m119,SAM,So put your plans of my room in the trash.
61598,L349516,u1793,m119,ADAM,I would have anyway.
61599,L349515,u1806,m119,SAM,Oh.
61600,L349514,u1793,m119,ADAM,Mom said I should.
61601,L349513,u1806,m119,SAM,What's that for?
61602,L349942,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Who are all these people?
61603,L349941,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,Atonement.
61604,L349927,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
61605,L349926,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
61606,L349925,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,Has he eaten anything at all?
61607,L349924,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I'm going to bed.
61608,L349768,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Uh...using Josh like that.
61609,L349767,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,Why?  What do you mean?
61610,L349766,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not."
61611,L349765,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,I couldn't sleep last night.
61612,L349764,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,What are you doing up so early?
61613,L349747,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,"Oh God, we don't want the police!"
61614,L349746,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,You'd better call and cancel.
61615,L349745,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
61616,L349744,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,And why was the alarm on?
61617,L349743,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,I couldn't get it to go down.
61618,L349742,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,What's wrong?
61619,L349741,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,I put him to work.
61620,L349739,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,"Here, honey!"
61621,L349738,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Mom?
61622,L349732,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
61623,L349731,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What did you think it would be?
61624,L349730,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,It's not what I was expecting.
61625,L349728,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Let's shut up and not kill her.
61626,L349727,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,My mother would die.
61627,L349725,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?"
61628,L349724,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Did you feel anything?
61629,L349723,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
61630,L349722,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"I want you to try something with me, okay?"
61631,L349721,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You have to ask like that?
61632,L349720,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson."
61633,L349719,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You're a good girl.
61634,L349718,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
61635,L349717,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
61636,L349716,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me."
61637,L349715,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Can you keep Sam straight?
61638,L349124,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided."
61639,L349123,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I had them in my pocket.
61640,L349121,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,What's that?
61641,L349120,u1799,m119,GEORGE,My keys.
61642,L349119,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Monday.
61643,L349118,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What's today?
61644,L349116,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Nope.
61645,L349115,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Don't you have school?
61646,L349114,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Is that legal?
61647,L349113,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'm living here while I build another house.
61648,L349112,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
61649,L349111,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Alyssa.
61650,L348907,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
61651,L348906,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Why?
61652,L348905,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,No.
61653,L348904,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Are you his friend?
61654,L348903,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,He seems lonely.
61655,L348902,u1799,m119,GEORGE,He must.
61656,L348900,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'll survive.
61657,L348899,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Sorry I got you into trouble.
61658,L349996,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,What?
61659,L349995,u1806,m119,SAM,Floating to Catalina.
61660,L349994,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Where are you?!
61661,L349952,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't wanna go.
61662,L349951,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
61663,L349950,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't wanna go.
61664,L349935,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Not if what he left me was real.
61665,L349934,u1806,m119,SAM,You'd hate him for the trick.
61666,L349933,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant."
61667,L349932,u1806,m119,SAM,You hate your father.
61668,L349813,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,What?
61669,L349812,u1806,m119,SAM,"Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours."
61670,L349807,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Are you afraid of heights?
61671,L349806,u1806,m119,SAM,On the handlebars or your shoulders?
61672,L349646,u1806,m119,SAM,Okay.  I guess.
61673,L349645,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?"
61674,L349644,u1806,m119,SAM,"What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you."
61675,L349643,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends."
61676,L349642,u1806,m119,SAM,It would help me if I could kiss you.
61677,L349641,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I thought I was helping you.
61678,L349640,u1806,m119,SAM,"You're off, you know?  You're way, way off."
61679,L349639,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Not really.
61680,L349638,u1806,m119,SAM,You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
61681,L349637,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I was wondering.
61682,L349635,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm not gay.
61683,L349634,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Josh said...
61684,L349633,u1806,m119,SAM,What are you talking about?
61685,L349632,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Are you sure you're totally into guys?
61686,L349631,u1806,m119,SAM,"It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look."
61687,L349630,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Does everything have to have a point?
61688,L349629,u1806,m119,SAM,What's the point of this?
61689,L349496,u1806,m119,SAM,Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
61690,L349495,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
61691,L349494,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
61692,L349493,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Why are you so uptight?
61693,L349492,u1806,m119,SAM,Why are you so stupid?
61694,L349491,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,We're not gonna do anything.
61695,L349490,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't want you to!
61696,L349489,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I'm coming in.
61697,L349488,u1806,m119,SAM,Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
61698,L349487,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
61699,L349485,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
61700,L349484,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
61701,L349483,u1806,m119,SAM,He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
61702,L349482,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
61703,L349481,u1806,m119,SAM,Really?
61704,L349480,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
61705,L349479,u1806,m119,SAM,Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
61706,L349477,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I'm okay.
61707,L349476,u1806,m119,SAM,I can use your mom's.
61708,L349475,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Huh?
61709,L349257,u1806,m119,SAM,No thanks.
61710,L349256,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
61711,L349255,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Turn over.
61712,L349254,u1806,m119,SAM,Why?
61713,L349253,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I wanted him to marry her.
61714,L349252,u1806,m119,SAM,Really?
61715,L349251,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
61716,L349250,u1806,m119,SAM,Yeah.
61717,L349249,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Do you remember me from when you lived here?
61718,L349246,u1806,m119,SAM,No.  That's okay.
61719,L349245,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I'll get your back.
61720,L349244,u1806,m119,SAM,"I might not stay, anyway."
61721,L349243,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
61722,L349242,u1806,m119,SAM,I can't even take a shower here.
61723,L349241,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,You look better without make-up.
61724,L349240,u1806,m119,SAM,He's a freak.
61725,L349221,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"Tell him I said ""hi""."
61726,L349220,u1806,m119,SAM,He jumped into the ocean.
61727,L349219,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Where's your dad?
61728,L349218,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't know.
61729,L349217,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,You should stay.
61730,L349216,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you."
61731,L349215,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't know.
61732,L349214,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Your dad's really gonna build his house?
61733,L349213,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
61734,L349212,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Where to?
61735,L349211,u1806,m119,SAM,They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
61736,L349210,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,What are you doing here?
61737,L349209,u1806,m119,SAM,Hey.
61738,L349208,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Hi.
61739,L349207,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
61740,L349898,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,No.
61741,L349897,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Will he talk to me?
61742,L349896,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,He won't leave my room.
61743,L349657,u1804,m119,ROBIN,He's not the type to worry.
61744,L349656,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry."
61745,L349655,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Well, he doesn't need to worry."
61746,L349654,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
61747,L349653,u1804,m119,ROBIN,He's at work while I'm here.
61748,L349652,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day."
61749,L349651,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Why is that?
61750,L349528,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,He's got a standing invitation.
61751,L349527,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
61752,L350001,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
61753,L350000,u1801,m119,KURT,Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
61754,L348926,u1801,m119,KURT,"He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen."
61755,L348925,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
61756,L348924,u1801,m119,KURT,"George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring."
61757,L348923,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,I wouldn't want you as a friend.
61758,L348919,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,"I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?"
61759,L348918,u1801,m119,KURT,We've known each other since grade school.
61760,L348917,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,Are you guys' friends?
61761,L348914,u1801,m119,KURT,You've been good this week.
61762,L348913,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,It could have been a squirt gun.
61763,L348912,u1801,m119,KURT,"And of course the Beck's, with the..."
61764,L348911,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
61765,L348910,u1801,m119,KURT,"From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure."
61766,L348909,u1794,m119,ALYSSA,This is such a street of whiners.
61767,L349919,u1795,m119,BOB,Months.
61768,L349918,u1799,m119,GEORGE,That would take weeks.
61769,L349912,u1799,m119,GEORGE,To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
61770,L349911,u1795,m119,BOB,"After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?"
61771,L349910,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I have the permit.
61772,L349909,u1795,m119,BOB,"Well, if it is, we have a problem."
61773,L349908,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It's thirty feet.
61774,L349907,u1795,m119,BOB,Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
61775,L349426,u1799,m119,GEORGE,If that's what it takes.
61776,L349425,u1795,m119,BOB,"I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?"
61777,L349422,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I flushed it down the toilet.
61778,L349421,u1795,m119,BOB,I hate to ask about a window.
61779,L349413,u1795,m119,BOB,Allowed outside the enclosed area.
61780,L349412,u1799,m119,GEORGE,A sink?
61781,L349411,u1795,m119,BOB,An exhaust system or a window is code.
61782,L349410,u1799,m119,GEORGE,And if I enclosed it?
61783,L349409,u1795,m119,BOB,"Oh, yes."
61784,L349408,u1799,m119,GEORGE,A violation?
61785,L349407,u1795,m119,BOB,Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
61786,L349406,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I've been dreading you.
61787,L349405,u1795,m119,BOB,Mr. Stevens?
61788,L349017,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Yes, it is."
61789,L349016,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"Well, it's the least I can do."
61790,L349015,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Thank you.
61791,L349014,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay."
61792,L349013,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me."
61793,L349012,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"What can I do for you, George?"
61794,L349011,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I've got one favor to ask.
61795,L349010,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Good.  I was hoping for that.
61796,L349009,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"Well, I feel better about this now."
61797,L349008,u1799,m119,GEORGE,For everything.
61798,L349007,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"I didn't know there would be a quiz, George."
61799,L349006,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?"
61800,L349005,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
61801,L349004,u1799,m119,GEORGE,From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
61802,L349003,u1796,m119,BRYAN,What are you talking about?  You love your job.
61803,L349002,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I hate this job.
61804,L349001,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
61805,L348999,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
61806,L348998,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
61807,L348997,u1799,m119,GEORGE,We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
61808,L348996,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Forty.
61809,L348995,u1799,m119,GEORGE,How old are you?
61810,L348994,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Oh.
61811,L348991,u1796,m119,BRYAN,That's too long.
61812,L348990,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Maybe...?
61813,L348989,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Maybe that's too long.
61814,L348988,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I've been here twenty years.
61815,L348987,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
61816,L348986,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'm not.
61817,L348985,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not."
61818,L348984,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
61819,L348983,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change."
61820,L348982,u1796,m119,BRYAN,"Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?"
61821,L348981,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?"
61822,L348980,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
61823,L348979,u1799,m119,GEORGE,He buys and sells the world.
61824,L348978,u1796,m119,BRYAN,Right...she married...what was he?
61825,L348977,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile."
61826,L348976,u1796,m119,BRYAN,How's your wife?
61827,L348975,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
61828,L348974,u1796,m119,BRYAN,how much weight have you lost?
61829,L348973,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Pardon me?
61830,L348972,u1796,m119,BRYAN,What are you on?
61831,L348971,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I'm good, thanks."
61832,L349886,u1806,m119,SAM,Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
61833,L349885,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,"It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?"
61834,L349884,u1806,m119,SAM,Is Alyssa here?
61835,L349474,u1806,m119,SAM,We're getting out of the ground today.
61836,L349473,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,You're here early today.
61837,L349472,u1806,m119,SAM,Thank you.
61838,L349471,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,"If she's not up, you can use my shower."
61839,L349350,u1806,m119,SAM,"Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you."
61840,L349349,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,"Come over anytime you need to, Sam."
61841,L349345,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,I want you both to stay.
61842,L349344,u1806,m119,SAM,Thanks for the shower.
61843,L349324,u1806,m119,SAM,Not a shower.
61844,L349323,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
61845,L349322,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm sorry.
61846,L349321,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,I didn't recognize you!
61847,L349320,u1806,m119,SAM,Uh huh.
61848,L349319,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,Sam?
61849,L349318,u1806,m119,SAM,Oh...okay.
61850,L349317,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,She didn't really say.
61851,L349316,u1806,m119,SAM,Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
61852,L349315,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,She's out with a friend.
61853,L349314,u1806,m119,SAM,Is Alyssa home?
61854,L349836,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,"Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!"
61855,L349835,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Hello?
61856,L349129,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,And you thought they might be under her dress?
61857,L349128,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I forgot where I put my keys.
61858,L348864,u1799,m119,GEORGE,My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
61859,L348863,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,I did warn you.
61860,L348862,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
61861,L348861,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,You'll have to explain that to the police.
61862,L348860,u1799,m119,GEORGE,The plumber's due out on Friday.
61863,L348859,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,"George, this is the third time."
61864,L348858,u1799,m119,GEORGE,There are no windows facing my...exposure.
61865,L348857,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
61866,L348856,u1799,m119,GEORGE,He escaped.  He's going back in.
61867,L348855,u1797,m119,COLLEEN,This has got to stop!
61868,L349109,u1806,m119,SAM,You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
61869,L349108,u1798,m119,COREY,I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
61870,L349107,u1806,m119,SAM,I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
61871,L349106,u1798,m119,COREY,"Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer."
61872,L349105,u1806,m119,SAM,I'll ask.
61873,L349104,u1798,m119,COREY,"It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump."
61874,L349103,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't know.
61875,L349102,u1798,m119,COREY,"The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe."
61876,L349980,u1806,m119,SAM,Here.
61877,L349979,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I don't wanna go, Sam."
61878,L349883,u1806,m119,SAM,"Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!"
61879,L349882,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
61880,L349881,u1806,m119,SAM,"This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you."
61881,L349880,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
61882,L349879,u1806,m119,SAM,You lied to me!
61883,L349878,u1799,m119,GEORGE,We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
61884,L349876,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Yes.
61885,L349875,u1806,m119,SAM,And you told Mom today?
61886,L349873,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
61887,L349872,u1806,m119,SAM,I still don't know what that means.
61888,L349871,u1799,m119,GEORGE,The kind where there isn't really an answer.
61889,L349870,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
61890,L349867,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
61891,L349866,u1806,m119,SAM,I still don't know what that means.
61892,L349865,u1799,m119,GEORGE,The kind where there isn't really an answer.
61893,L349864,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
61894,L349862,u1806,m119,SAM,"No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?"
61895,L349861,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Are you taking them still?
61896,L349860,u1806,m119,SAM,"I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick."
61897,L349859,u1806,m119,SAM,What's wrong with your back?
61898,L349858,u1799,m119,GEORGE,She seemed upset.
61899,L349857,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
61900,L349856,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You look better than ever.
61901,L349798,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses."
61902,L349797,u1806,m119,SAM,Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
61903,L349591,u1806,m119,SAM,That's so weird...
61904,L349590,u1799,m119,GEORGE,After everything.
61905,L349589,u1806,m119,SAM,After everything he did to you and your mom?
61906,L349588,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I loved him too much.
61907,L349587,u1806,m119,SAM,Do you ever wish you had done it?
61908,L349586,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
61909,L349585,u1806,m119,SAM,I would have killed him.
61910,L349584,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
61911,L349583,u1806,m119,SAM,Why wouldn't she leave?
61912,L349582,u1799,m119,GEORGE,To hide a black eye.
61913,L349581,u1806,m119,SAM,Sun glasses?
61914,L349580,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
61915,L349579,u1806,m119,SAM,Are you talking?
61916,L349576,u1806,m119,SAM,Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
61917,L349575,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I'm proud of you, Sam."
61918,L349574,u1806,m119,SAM,I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
61919,L349573,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"If I asked you to stop, would you?"
61920,L349572,u1806,m119,SAM,"Getting high, I guess."
61921,L349571,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What would you be doing now?
61922,L349570,u1806,m119,SAM,I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
61923,L349569,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I gave up on you.
61924,L349568,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm telling you now.
61925,L349567,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I wish you had told me then.
61926,L349566,u1806,m119,SAM,"He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today."
61927,L349565,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that."
61928,L349564,u1806,m119,SAM,He's got nothing to do with me.
61929,L349563,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting."
61930,L349562,u1806,m119,SAM,What do you know about me?
61931,L349561,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I know parts of who you are.
61932,L349560,u1806,m119,SAM,"See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am."
61933,L349559,u1799,m119,GEORGE,That's not true.
61934,L349558,u1806,m119,SAM,Nothing.
61935,L349557,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What are you now?
61936,L349556,u1806,m119,SAM,What I'm not.
61937,L349555,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What would you like to be?
61938,L349554,u1806,m119,SAM,How do you become something you're not?
61939,L349553,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I know the feeling.
61940,L349552,u1806,m119,SAM,I like how it feels not to feel.
61941,L349551,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I know.  Why?
61942,L349550,u1806,m119,SAM,I took some of your Vicodin.
61943,L349524,u1806,m119,SAM,"Hi, Mom."
61944,L349523,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Hi, Alyssa."
61945,L349456,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Try it.  It feels good.
61946,L349455,u1806,m119,SAM,We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
61947,L349454,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
61948,L349453,u1806,m119,SAM,Don't.  I don't want it.
61949,L349452,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you."
61950,L349447,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me."
61951,L349446,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm not even listening.
61952,L349445,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive."
61953,L349444,u1806,m119,SAM,I'll have to pay him back.
61954,L349443,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words..."
61955,L349442,u1806,m119,SAM,I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
61956,L349441,u1799,m119,GEORGE,My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
61957,L349440,u1806,m119,SAM,"Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me."
61958,L349438,u1806,m119,SAM,No.
61959,L349437,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Sit down for a second.
61960,L349436,u1806,m119,SAM,You can't make me do a thing.
61961,L349435,u1799,m119,GEORGE,The gloves on the table are for you.
61962,L349434,u1806,m119,SAM,You're too fucking late.
61963,L349433,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
61964,L349432,u1806,m119,SAM,I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
61965,L349417,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I might have a solution.
61966,L349416,u1806,m119,SAM,Did you got through my pants?
61967,L349415,u1799,m119,GEORGE,A friend of yours is here.
61968,L349414,u1806,m119,SAM,Where is it?
61969,L349360,u1806,m119,SAM,"Oh, okay."
61970,L349359,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Well, until you know, you can't go."
61971,L349358,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't know.
61972,L349357,u1799,m119,GEORGE,When are you going to be back?
61973,L349356,u1806,m119,SAM,I don't know.
61974,L349355,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Where are you going?
61975,L349354,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Hey...hey!
61976,L349353,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm leaving.
61977,L349313,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You'll have money when you work for it.
61978,L349312,u1806,m119,SAM,"If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money."
61979,L349310,u1806,m119,SAM,You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
61980,L349309,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I can promise you complete privacy.
61981,L349308,u1806,m119,SAM,And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
61982,L349307,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I don't beg.
61983,L349306,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
61984,L349305,u1806,m119,SAM,Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
61985,L349304,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It'll be fine.
61986,L349303,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm not doing it!
61987,L349302,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'd blame you.  I want you here.
61988,L349301,u1806,m119,SAM,No one would blame me if I left!
61989,L349299,u1806,m119,SAM,You're so predictable.
61990,L349298,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You'll have money when you work.
61991,L349297,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
61992,L349296,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I don't know.
61993,L349269,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
61994,L349268,u1806,m119,SAM,You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
61995,L349267,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It bugs me.
61996,L349266,u1806,m119,SAM,Why?
61997,L349265,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
61998,L349264,u1799,m119,GEORGE,No you don't.
61999,L349263,u1806,m119,SAM,I hate turkey.
62000,L349262,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude."
62001,L349261,u1806,m119,SAM,No.
62002,L349260,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
62003,L349237,u1806,m119,SAM,Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
62004,L349236,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I warned you yesterday.
62005,L349235,u1806,m119,SAM,What are you doing?!
62006,L349228,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Goodnight.
62007,L349227,u1806,m119,SAM,Probably in the bible.
62008,L349203,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I almost saw Catalina.
62009,L349202,u1806,m119,SAM,Are you totally insane?!
62010,L349184,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
62011,L349183,u1806,m119,SAM,I'll hate you forever.
62012,L349182,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now."
62013,L349181,u1806,m119,SAM,"If you hit me, I'll call the police."
62014,L349180,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass."
62015,L349173,u1806,m119,SAM,Mom...please.
62016,L349172,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You don't have a choice.
62017,L349171,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm not going!
62018,L349168,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You have everything?
62019,L349167,u1806,m119,SAM,"Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!"
62020,L349166,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'll get your bag.
62021,L349165,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm not going!
62022,L349164,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You'll know me by the time we're through.
62023,L349163,u1806,m119,SAM,"Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you."
62024,L349154,u1806,m119,SAM,No I'm not!
62025,L349153,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
62026,L349150,u1806,m119,SAM,You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
62027,L349149,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Because I live there.
62028,L349148,u1806,m119,SAM,Why would you be there?
62029,L349147,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'll be around to check up on you.
62030,L349146,u1806,m119,SAM,To check up on me?
62031,L349145,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
62032,L349051,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me."
62033,L349050,u1802,m119,NURSE,No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
62034,L349049,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to."
62035,L349048,u1802,m119,NURSE,"I'm sorry, I don't know what that was."
62036,L349047,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I haven't been touched in years.
62037,L349046,u1802,m119,NURSE,Good for you.
62038,L349045,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I can die trying.
62039,L349044,u1802,m119,NURSE,Can you build a house in four months?
62040,L349043,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?"
62041,L349042,u1802,m119,NURSE,"No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?"
62042,L349040,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You know what mortise and tenon is?
62043,L349039,u1802,m119,NURSE,What kind of house?
62044,L349038,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'd build a house.
62045,L349037,u1802,m119,NURSE,What would you do?
62046,L349036,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Good for you.
62047,L349035,u1802,m119,NURSE,I'd eat a lot of red meat.
62048,L349915,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I don't let him.  He just loves to.
62049,L349914,u1801,m119,KURT,"Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?"
62050,L349892,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I want you to find someone for me.
62051,L349891,u1801,m119,KURT,"God, you look like crap, George."
62052,L349890,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I need you to do me a favor.
62053,L349889,u1801,m119,KURT,It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
62054,L349352,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
62055,L349351,u1801,m119,KURT,I'm surprised he hasn't left.
62056,L349342,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
62057,L349341,u1801,m119,KURT,Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
62058,L349339,u1801,m119,KURT,I know there's an explanation.
62059,L349338,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Ah!  Oh....
62060,L348933,u1801,m119,KURT,"At least your father tried, George."
62061,L348932,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Thanks for telling me.
62062,L348931,u1801,m119,KURT,"Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you..."
62063,L348930,u1801,m119,KURT,"Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean."
62064,L348929,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
62065,L348928,u1801,m119,KURT,Left you this place.
62066,L348927,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
62067,L348922,u1801,m119,KURT,"We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you."
62068,L348921,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I aimed high.
62069,L349826,u1805,m119,RYAN,I don't even care if he ever comes back.
62070,L349825,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"She's a little sad, is all."
62071,L349824,u1805,m119,RYAN,Because Dad left?
62072,L349823,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"She needs to be alone, I think."
62073,L349822,u1805,m119,RYAN,It's okay.
62074,L349821,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Oh.  Sorry.
62075,L349820,u1805,m119,RYAN,I just wanted to know where Mom was?
62076,L349596,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Three.
62077,L349595,u1805,m119,RYAN,How many bedrooms will your house have?
62078,L349854,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Not a perfect day.
62079,L349853,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I better get the kids home.
62080,L349846,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'm an idiot to have you up there.
62081,L349845,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Don't move!
62082,L349802,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It's not my back that's killing me.
62083,L349801,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Are you going to kiss me?
62084,L349800,u1799,m119,GEORGE,So could I.
62085,L349799,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I could die.
62086,L349792,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What?
62087,L349791,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Back.  Neck.  Back.
62088,L349787,u1804,m119,ROBIN,'I'll be in the bedroom.'
62089,L349786,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What did he say?
62090,L349785,u1804,m119,ROBIN,No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
62091,L349784,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Left you?
62092,L349783,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Peter left me yesterday.
62093,L349782,u1799,m119,GEORGE,No.  Mostly me.
62094,L349781,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me."
62095,L349780,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I didn't think you'd come today.
62096,L349779,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Is your back still killing you?
62097,L349695,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
62098,L349694,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I need to know.
62099,L349693,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Let's not do this, okay?"
62100,L349692,u1804,m119,ROBIN,If I weren't married?
62101,L349691,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You bit my finger.
62102,L349690,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I'm married.
62103,L349689,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I can't pick you up.
62104,L349688,u1804,m119,ROBIN,It sounded like a pick-up line.
62105,L349687,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
62106,L349686,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You've never said that before.
62107,L349685,u1799,m119,GEORGE,That was the truth.
62108,L349684,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?"
62109,L349683,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What did I say?
62110,L349682,u1804,m119,ROBIN,When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
62111,L349681,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Going on?
62112,L349680,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Nothing is going on with us, is it?"
62113,L349677,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I can hire workers to help me.
62114,L349676,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I thought we were helping.
62115,L349675,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'd rather you not be here.
62116,L349674,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it."
62117,L349673,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
62118,L349672,u1799,m119,GEORGE,How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
62119,L349671,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George."
62120,L349670,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
62121,L349669,u1804,m119,ROBIN,No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
62122,L349668,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
62123,L349546,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse."
62124,L349545,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Let's see if you've gotten any better.
62125,L349541,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Watch out for the smile, boys."
62126,L349540,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I smiled at him.
62127,L349539,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
62128,L349536,u1804,m119,ROBIN,This was my very first slow dance.
62129,L349535,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It's been a while.
62130,L349509,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I think so.
62131,L349508,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Do you need help?
62132,L349507,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You're a good mother.
62133,L349506,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
62134,L349505,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'll find something that won't kill them.
62135,L349504,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
62136,L349503,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You brought your kids?
62137,L349502,u1799,m119,GEORGE,He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
62138,L349501,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Where's Sam?
62139,L349500,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"No, I'm...thanks.  I took something."
62140,L349499,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
62141,L349498,u1799,m119,GEORGE,My stupid back.
62142,L349497,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I thought you'd be up with the sun.
62143,L349401,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You're not well.
62144,L349400,u1799,m119,GEORGE,With your hands or your tongue?
62145,L349398,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
62146,L349397,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I've been wrong a lot in my life.
62147,L349395,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George."
62148,L349394,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Go in there and lick his attitude.
62149,L349393,u1804,m119,ROBIN,My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
62150,L349392,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Oh...with his ear infection!
62151,L349391,u1804,m119,ROBIN,That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
62152,L349390,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?"
62153,L349389,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real."
62154,L349388,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Finished or unfinished?
62155,L349387,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I dreamed about your house last night.
62156,L349386,u1799,m119,GEORGE,It's not breakfast yet.
62157,L349295,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
62158,L349294,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What is it?
62159,L349292,u1804,m119,ROBIN,We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
62160,L349291,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
62161,L349290,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves."
62162,L349289,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Do you remember?
62163,L349288,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time."
62164,L349287,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What have you been before today?
62165,L349286,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today."
62166,L349281,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Sam's favorite.
62167,L349280,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
62168,L349279,u1804,m119,ROBIN,The first and the last.
62169,L349278,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Which?
62170,L349277,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
62171,L349276,u1799,m119,GEORGE,But you hated four out of the five you did.
62172,L349275,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I used to live here.
62173,L349274,u1799,m119,GEORGE,What?
62174,L349273,u1804,m119,ROBIN,It makes me sad.
62175,L349272,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Well, for later then."
62176,L349271,u1799,m119,GEORGE,We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
62177,L349175,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it."
62178,L349174,u1804,m119,ROBIN,George --
62179,L349170,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Let's go.
62180,L349169,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I did say he could go.
62181,L349162,u1799,m119,GEORGE,He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
62182,L349161,u1804,m119,ROBIN,No.  I was going to let you do that.
62183,L349160,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
62184,L349159,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Last time you were gone for a week!
62185,L349158,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I can't leave the house?
62186,L349157,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I drove over and you were gone.
62187,L349156,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I don't have a phone.
62188,L349155,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working."
62189,L349101,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I'm married.
62190,L349100,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"Hey, hey!"
62191,L349097,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"No, you don't.  Trust me."
62192,L349096,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I want him with me.
62193,L349095,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Forget it, really.  I'll survive."
62194,L349094,u1799,m119,GEORGE,At least we'll have a house to show for it.
62195,L349093,u1804,m119,ROBIN,One of you would end up dead.
62196,L349092,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
62197,L349091,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
62198,L349090,u1799,m119,GEORGE,The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
62199,L349089,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
62200,L349088,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
62201,L349087,u1804,m119,ROBIN,He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
62202,L349086,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
62203,L349085,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day."
62204,L349084,u1799,m119,GEORGE,When's school over?
62205,L349083,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it."
62206,L349082,u1799,m119,GEORGE,The garage.
62207,L349081,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Where will you live?
62208,L349080,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I love those doors.
62209,L349079,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire..."
62210,L349078,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
62211,L349077,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Money?
62212,L349076,u1799,m119,GEORGE,There's nothing anymore to stop me.
62213,L349075,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it."
62214,L349074,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
62215,L349073,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Why call me?
62216,L349072,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I was parked in day parking.
62217,L349071,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Why would they tow your truck?
62218,L349070,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I need to talk to you.
62219,L349069,u1799,m119,GEORGE,"I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think."
62220,L349068,u1804,m119,ROBIN,But you can't call me while you think?
62221,L349067,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Kurt's been feeding him.
62222,L349066,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What did you do with your dog?
62223,L349065,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Four days.  I left to think.
62224,L349064,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Where have you been for a week?!
62225,L349063,u1799,m119,GEORGE,A blueprint spool.
62226,L349062,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
62227,L349061,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
62228,L349060,u1799,m119,GEORGE,I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
62229,L349059,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What?
62230,L349058,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
62231,L349057,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
62232,L349056,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
62233,L349055,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!"
62234,L348955,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!"
62235,L348954,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Why does he have a lock on his door?
62236,L348953,u1804,m119,ROBIN,He never answers.
62237,L348952,u1799,m119,GEORGE,He doesn't answer.
62238,L348951,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What are you doing?
62239,L348942,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Where he always is.
62240,L348941,u1799,m119,GEORGE,Where is he?
62241,L348940,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Lock the door behind you.
62242,L348939,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You let him pierce his nose?
62243,L348938,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
62244,L348937,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Ring the bell before you try the door.
62245,L348936,u1799,m119,GEORGE,You should lock your doors.
62246,L349815,u1800,m119,JOSH,I could use the money.
62247,L349814,u1806,m119,SAM,It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
62248,L349377,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm thinking it's too weird now.
62249,L349376,u1800,m119,JOSH,"He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want."
62250,L349374,u1800,m119,JOSH,"She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it."
62251,L349373,u1806,m119,SAM,I wasn't sure.
62252,L349372,u1800,m119,JOSH,Don't even...I'm there.
62253,L349371,u1806,m119,SAM,What's your deal with Alyssa?
62254,L349336,u1800,m119,JOSH,You got the money?
62255,L349335,u1806,m119,SAM,You got any weed?
62256,L349334,u1800,m119,JOSH,Nothing.
62257,L349333,u1806,m119,SAM,Does Alyssa know?
62258,L349332,u1800,m119,JOSH,"It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes."
62259,L348885,u1806,m119,SAM,No.
62260,L348884,u1800,m119,JOSH,Been thinking?
62261,L350016,u1806,m119,SAM,The payoff.
62262,L350015,u1801,m119,KURT,"Then you tell me, what just happened?"
62263,L350014,u1806,m119,SAM,Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
62264,L350013,u1801,m119,KURT,What the fuck?
62265,L350010,u1806,m119,SAM,I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
62266,L350009,u1801,m119,KURT,What are you talking about?
62267,L349998,u1806,m119,SAM,Who?
62268,L349997,u1801,m119,KURT,He said he heard hammering.
62269,L349992,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I feel in love with George again.
62270,L349991,u1803,m119,PETER,That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
62271,L349990,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I hardly recognize you with a beard.
62272,L349711,u1803,m119,PETER,I'll be in the bedroom.
62273,L349710,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Sam took them to a movie.
62274,L349709,u1803,m119,PETER,Where are the kids?
62275,L349708,u1803,m119,PETER,Please don't leave me.
62276,L349707,u1804,m119,ROBIN,That's the problem.
62277,L349706,u1803,m119,PETER,I never asked for more.
62278,L349705,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Despite you.
62279,L349704,u1803,m119,PETER,"You live a fabulous life, Robin."
62280,L349703,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You never really trusted me.
62281,L349702,u1803,m119,PETER,I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
62282,L349701,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What are you doing home?
62283,L349700,u1803,m119,PETER,"That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?"
62284,L349628,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I know.
62285,L349627,u1803,m119,PETER,I was talking about our marriage.
62286,L349625,u1803,m119,PETER,"So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?"
62287,L349624,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
62288,L349623,u1803,m119,PETER,You can't go with me because of Sam?
62289,L349622,u1804,m119,ROBIN,We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
62290,L349621,u1803,m119,PETER,You can't go because of Sam?
62291,L349620,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I can't go right now.
62292,L349619,u1803,m119,PETER,Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
62293,L349618,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is."
62294,L349617,u1803,m119,PETER,What?
62295,L349616,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I'm helping George build his house.
62296,L349615,u1803,m119,PETER,Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
62297,L349614,u1804,m119,ROBIN,After the kids are back in school.
62298,L349613,u1803,m119,PETER,Sooner than the Fall.
62299,L349612,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
62300,L349610,u1803,m119,PETER,Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
62301,L349609,u1804,m119,ROBIN,The biggest waste of time since television.
62302,L349608,u1803,m119,PETER,We should take a vacation.
62303,L349607,u1804,m119,ROBIN,To shave your chest?
62304,L349368,u1803,m119,PETER,I'd be you.
62305,L349367,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
62306,L349366,u1803,m119,PETER,"If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry."
62307,L349365,u1804,m119,ROBIN,It would worry me.
62308,L349364,u1803,m119,PETER,Should I?
62309,L349363,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
62310,L349328,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I'll make you something.
62311,L349327,u1803,m119,PETER,Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
62312,L349326,u1804,m119,ROBIN,We've eaten.
62313,L348869,u1804,m119,ROBIN,A man he respects.
62314,L348868,u1803,m119,PETER,His father is a man.
62315,L348867,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
62316,L350027,u1806,m119,SAM,Do you like red?
62317,L350026,u1803,m119,PETER,"I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle."
62318,L350025,u1806,m119,SAM,Either do you.
62319,L350024,u1803,m119,PETER,You don't look like you.
62320,L348875,u1806,m119,SAM,"If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?"
62321,L348874,u1803,m119,PETER,Do it now!
62322,L348873,u1803,m119,PETER,Take it off.
62323,L348872,u1806,m119,SAM,No.
62324,L348871,u1803,m119,PETER,Are you wearing eye shadow?
62325,L348870,u1806,m119,SAM,Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
62326,L349989,u1803,m119,PETER,Okay.
62327,L349988,u1805,m119,RYAN,I guess I could teach you some things.
62328,L349987,u1803,m119,PETER,No.
62329,L349986,u1805,m119,RYAN,Do you know anything about building a house?
62330,L349966,u1805,m119,RYAN,Why?
62331,L349965,u1803,m119,PETER,I've missed you guys.
62332,L349964,u1805,m119,RYAN,It's not ours.  It's George's.
62333,L349963,u1803,m119,PETER,You got a dog?
62334,L349962,u1805,m119,RYAN,Hey.
62335,L349961,u1803,m119,PETER,Hey.
62336,L350039,u1806,m119,SAM,"Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want."
62337,L350038,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
62338,L350037,u1806,m119,SAM,This is what he wants.
62339,L350036,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You could keep it and rent it out?
62340,L350035,u1806,m119,SAM,Yeah.
62341,L350034,u1804,m119,ROBIN,You're sure about this?
62342,L349795,u1806,m119,SAM,I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
62343,L349794,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I don't know what I'm doing.
62344,L349793,u1806,m119,SAM,The door was open.
62345,L349756,u1806,m119,SAM,Depends on what I'd give up on.
62346,L349755,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Can you stay for dinner?
62347,L349754,u1806,m119,SAM,There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
62348,L348962,u1806,m119,SAM,I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
62349,L348961,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I didn't go in your room.
62350,L348960,u1806,m119,SAM,What are you doing in my room?
62351,L349760,u1804,m119,ROBIN,In the bedroom.
62352,L349759,u1805,m119,RYAN,"Dad's home, already?"
62353,L349758,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Go tell your father we're eating.
62354,L349662,u1805,m119,RYAN,"Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!"
62355,L349661,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Nothing R, okay?"
62356,L349603,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
62357,L349602,u1805,m119,RYAN,"Yes, it is."
62358,L349601,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Adam, that's not true!"
62359,L349534,u1805,m119,RYAN,Someone stop her!
62360,L349533,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I brought a few of my own.
62361,L349469,u1805,m119,RYAN,Can we really help build a house?
62362,L349468,u1804,m119,ROBIN,"Ryan, would you rather swim or work?"
62363,L349463,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
62364,L349462,u1805,m119,RYAN,All day again?
62365,L349459,u1804,m119,ROBIN,I just thought it would be nice.
62366,L349458,u1805,m119,RYAN,Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
62367,L348879,u1805,m119,RYAN,Dad said it first.
62368,L348878,u1804,m119,ROBIN,What did you say?
62369,L348877,u1805,m119,RYAN,Queer.
62370,L348850,u1804,m119,ROBIN,He'll be gone for his birthday.
62371,L348849,u1805,m119,RYAN,Why?
62372,L348848,u1804,m119,ROBIN,Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
62373,L348409,u1807,m120,ABERNATHY,Better make it a week.
62374,L348408,u1821,m120,MAE ROSE,A night in the hole?
62375,L348405,u1807,m120,ABERNATHY,That's my girl.
62376,L348404,u1821,m120,MAE ROSE,Nigger.
62377,L348403,u1807,m120,ABERNATHY,"No, nigger."
62378,L348402,u1821,m120,MAE ROSE,Nagger?
62379,L348401,u1807,m120,ABERNATHY,"They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?"
62380,L348527,u1807,m120,ABERNATHY,"It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him."
62381,L348526,u1815,m120,DOCTOR,He's a big one.
62382,L348525,u1807,m120,ABERNATHY,And the baby?
62383,L348524,u1815,m120,DOCTOR,She's doing just fine.
62384,L348523,u1807,m120,ABERNATHY,Is Mae Rose okay?
62385,L348522,u1815,m120,DOCTOR,She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
62386,L348563,u1827,m120,RAY,"Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would."
62387,L348562,u1808,m120,BISCUIT,"Not for me, it ain't."
62388,L348561,u1827,m120,RAY,It's 1945. It's a different world now.
62389,L348559,u1827,m120,RAY,"Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep."
62390,L348558,u1808,m120,BISCUIT,"What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure."
62391,L348557,u1827,m120,RAY,These are free papers.
62392,L348556,u1808,m120,BISCUIT,Hell with him. It ain't that.
62393,L348555,u1827,m120,RAY,"Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him."
62394,L348245,u1808,m120,BISCUIT,Cost you a pair of nylons.
62395,L348244,u1827,m120,RAY,I'm talking about a haircut.
62396,L348243,u1808,m120,BISCUIT,Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
62397,L348242,u1827,m120,RAY,"Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?"
62398,L348581,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
62399,L348580,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,But you can't.
62400,L348579,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,"Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you..."
62401,L348576,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,"I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?"
62402,L348575,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us."
62403,L348574,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
62404,L348573,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?"
62405,L348507,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
62406,L348506,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison."
62407,L348505,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
62408,L348504,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?"
62409,L348503,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
62410,L348502,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
62411,L348501,u1809,m120,BLOCKER,We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
62412,L348500,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,We get the games on the radio sometimes.
62413,L347859,u1827,m120,RAY,"I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too."
62414,L347858,u1810,m120,BOUNCER,Sharp.
62415,L347857,u1827,m120,RAY,"Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?"
62416,L347856,u1810,m120,BOUNCER,Yeah...
62417,L347855,u1827,m120,RAY,"But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?"
62418,L347854,u1810,m120,BOUNCER,Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
62419,L347853,u1827,m120,RAY,Then what's the problem?
62420,L347852,u1810,m120,BOUNCER,"No, but..."
62421,L347851,u1827,m120,RAY,Is Spanky here?
62422,L347850,u1810,m120,BOUNCER,"Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you."
62423,L348624,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations."
62424,L348623,u1833,m120,YVETTE,Want me to come back some other time?
62425,L348622,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood."
62426,L348621,u1833,m120,YVETTE,"You know, go to the tonk or whatever."
62427,L348620,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Take care of me?
62428,L348619,u1833,m120,YVETTE,"I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you."
62429,L348618,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
62430,L348617,u1833,m120,YVETTE,She always said that if you were on the outside...
62431,L348616,u1833,m120,YVETTE,"Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans."
62432,L348615,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Married?
62433,L348614,u1833,m120,YVETTE,She got married last month.
62434,L348613,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Why not?
62435,L348612,u1833,m120,YVETTE,"Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today."
62436,L348611,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"She's alright, isn't she?"
62437,L348610,u1833,m120,YVETTE,My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
62438,L348609,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Yeah.
62439,L348760,u1831,m120,WILKINS,I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
62440,L348759,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Sure, boss."
62441,L348758,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?"
62442,L348730,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out."
62443,L348729,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble."
62444,L348710,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Goodnight, Claude."
62445,L348709,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike."
62446,L348677,u1831,m120,WILKINS,I'll be right back.
62447,L348676,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Yes, sir."
62448,L348675,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"You know I trust you, Claude."
62449,L348663,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
62450,L348662,u1831,m120,WILKINS,Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
62451,L348661,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
62452,L348660,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder."
62453,L348659,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
62454,L348658,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?"
62455,L348657,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings."
62456,L348656,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me."
62457,L348654,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf."
62458,L348653,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Yes, boss."
62459,L348652,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on."
62460,L348629,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job."
62461,L348628,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss."
62462,L348627,u1814,m120,DILLARD,Comfortable?
62463,L348351,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Here!
62464,L348350,u1814,m120,DILLARD,Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
62465,L348240,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee."
62466,L348239,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York."
62467,L348238,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only."
62468,L348137,u1814,m120,DILLARD,He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
62469,L348136,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I got it... boss.
62470,L348291,u1813,m120,DAISY,"Sure, Claude, whatever you say."
62471,L348290,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?"
62472,L348289,u1813,m120,DAISY,"Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too."
62473,L348288,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise."
62474,L348287,u1813,m120,DAISY,"He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job."
62475,L348286,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up."
62476,L348285,u1813,m120,DAISY,Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
62477,L348284,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
62478,L347899,u1813,m120,DAISY,But I'm having a good time...
62479,L347898,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Come on, honey, let's get out of here."
62480,L347874,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back."
62481,L347873,u1813,m120,DAISY,"That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?"
62482,L347872,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Engagement ring!
62483,L347871,u1813,m120,DAISY,"I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude."
62484,L347870,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?"
62485,L347869,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
62486,L347868,u1813,m120,DAISY,Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
62487,L347867,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes."
62488,L348038,u1830,m120,SYLVIA,Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
62489,L348037,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
62490,L348036,u1830,m120,SYLVIA,"You're cute. You have any money, Claude?"
62491,L348035,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
62492,L348034,u1830,m120,SYLVIA,He looks like he can take care of himself.
62493,L348033,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
62494,L348032,u1830,m120,SYLVIA,"Well, Mr. ""C"", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons."
62495,L348031,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I know it begins with a ""C""..."
62496,L348030,u1830,m120,SYLVIA,Can't you remember your own name?
62497,L348029,u1830,m120,SYLVIA,I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
62498,L348028,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,That's because I've never been here before.
62499,L348027,u1830,m120,SYLVIA,I've never seen you in here before.
62500,L348846,u1827,m120,RAY,"I'm sorry, he's on medication..."
62501,L348845,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I know you're not talking to me...
62502,L348844,u1827,m120,RAY,"Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance."
62503,L348843,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Well, if you must know, they could be closer."
62504,L348842,u1827,m120,RAY,"Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats."
62505,L348841,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Yeah? You and what army?
62506,L348840,u1827,m120,RAY,"If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead."
62507,L348839,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,They're touching.
62508,L348838,u1827,m120,RAY,So?
62509,L348837,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla."
62510,L348836,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire."
62511,L348835,u1827,m120,RAY,"Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?"
62512,L348831,u1827,m120,RAY,Gimme that damn thing.
62513,L348830,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You didn't get ketchup?
62514,L348829,u1827,m120,RAY,Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
62515,L348828,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
62516,L348827,u1827,m120,RAY,Why the hell not?
62517,L348826,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I can't eat this.
62518,L348801,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
62519,L348800,u1827,m120,RAY,It's too late for plans.
62520,L348799,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that."
62521,L348798,u1827,m120,RAY,"Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway."
62522,L348797,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
62523,L348796,u1827,m120,RAY,Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
62524,L348781,u1827,m120,RAY,"You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging..."
62525,L348780,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,'Course I was right. About what?
62526,L348779,u1827,m120,RAY,"Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right."
62527,L348777,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
62528,L348776,u1827,m120,RAY,They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
62529,L348775,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
62530,L348774,u1827,m120,RAY,"Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody."
62531,L348773,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
62532,L348772,u1827,m120,RAY,"Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment."
62533,L348771,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while."
62534,L348770,u1827,m120,RAY,Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
62535,L348755,u1827,m120,RAY,He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
62536,L348754,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
62537,L348749,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that."
62538,L348748,u1827,m120,RAY,I said you're soft.
62539,L348747,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What'd you say?
62540,L348746,u1827,m120,RAY,That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
62541,L348745,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I can't do it.
62542,L348744,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!"
62543,L348743,u1827,m120,RAY,"No, I'm gonna kill him --"
62544,L348734,u1827,m120,RAY,"He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike."
62545,L348733,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around."
62546,L348701,u1827,m120,RAY,"I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one."
62547,L348700,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe."
62548,L348699,u1827,m120,RAY,"I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now."
62549,L348698,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
62550,L348697,u1827,m120,RAY,You sure it was him?
62551,L348693,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Hey, there's Wilkins!"
62552,L348692,u1827,m120,RAY,Don't make me take them away from you.
62553,L348691,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
62554,L348690,u1827,m120,RAY,"Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys."
62555,L348689,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car."
62556,L348688,u1827,m120,RAY,"This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys."
62557,L348687,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man."
62558,L348686,u1827,m120,RAY,Back to New York for starters.
62559,L348685,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Go where, Ray?"
62560,L348684,u1827,m120,RAY,"Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!"
62561,L348683,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You ain't getting out of that trunk.
62562,L348682,u1827,m120,RAY,Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
62563,L348681,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
62564,L348680,u1827,m120,RAY,"You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?"
62565,L348679,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
62566,L348678,u1827,m120,RAY,"Damn, it was getting hot in there."
62567,L348674,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
62568,L348673,u1827,m120,RAY,"You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?"
62569,L348672,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him."
62570,L348671,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Don't touch that car.
62571,L348670,u1827,m120,RAY,What the hell are you doing?
62572,L348669,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Goodnight, Ray."
62573,L348668,u1827,m120,RAY,"You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing."
62574,L348667,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I'm not working on a plan.
62575,L348666,u1827,m120,RAY,"Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?"
62576,L348665,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
62577,L348664,u1827,m120,RAY,"You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?"
62578,L348645,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
62579,L348644,u1827,m120,RAY,"You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you."
62580,L348643,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What?!
62581,L348642,u1827,m120,RAY,"We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me."
62582,L348641,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it."
62583,L348640,u1827,m120,RAY,That was five years ago.
62584,L348639,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
62585,L348638,u1827,m120,RAY,"I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all."
62586,L348637,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
62587,L348636,u1827,m120,RAY,"After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be."
62588,L348635,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now."
62589,L348634,u1827,m120,RAY,Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
62590,L348633,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
62591,L348603,u1827,m120,RAY,Then I have nothing left to say to you.
62592,L348602,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,That's the way it is.
62593,L348601,u1827,m120,RAY,"Well, if that's the way it is..."
62594,L348600,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
62595,L348599,u1827,m120,RAY,"Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret."
62596,L348598,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson."
62597,L348597,u1827,m120,RAY,"Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks."
62598,L348596,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block."
62599,L348595,u1827,m120,RAY,My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
62600,L348594,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging."
62601,L348593,u1827,m120,RAY,Crop duster.
62602,L348592,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?"
62603,L348591,u1827,m120,RAY,I don't see you coming up with any plans.
62604,L348590,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now."
62605,L348589,u1827,m120,RAY,He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
62606,L348588,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I'm not in the mood right now, Ray."
62607,L348587,u1827,m120,RAY,One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
62608,L348584,u1827,m120,RAY,Make 'em throw strikes.
62609,L348583,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
62610,L348578,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
62611,L348577,u1827,m120,RAY,"Let it go, Claude."
62612,L348571,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Let me see that.
62613,L348570,u1827,m120,RAY,It's a pardon from the governor.
62614,L348534,u1827,m120,RAY,Whatever.
62615,L348533,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Crawfords.
62616,L348532,u1827,m120,RAY,Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
62617,L348531,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it."
62618,L348519,u1827,m120,RAY,We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
62619,L348518,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
62620,L348516,u1827,m120,RAY,"So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?"
62621,L348515,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
62622,L348485,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
62623,L348484,u1827,m120,RAY,Judge must have money riding on the championship.
62624,L348478,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do."
62625,L348477,u1827,m120,RAY,Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
62626,L348476,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Him?
62627,L348475,u1827,m120,RAY,"You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot."
62628,L348473,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
62629,L348472,u1827,m120,RAY,What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
62630,L348457,u1827,m120,RAY,"Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!"
62631,L348456,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?"
62632,L348455,u1827,m120,RAY,"You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start."
62633,L348454,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What am I gonna eat?
62634,L348453,u1827,m120,RAY,Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
62635,L348452,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I can't eat it with mustard.
62636,L348451,u1827,m120,RAY,Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
62637,L348450,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You get ketchup?
62638,L348449,u1827,m120,RAY,"They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?"
62639,L348448,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I know people.
62640,L348447,u1827,m120,RAY,"Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?"
62641,L348446,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
62642,L348445,u1827,m120,RAY,I don't know. Who do you want?
62643,L348444,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
62644,L348443,u1827,m120,RAY,"Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox."
62645,L348442,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
62646,L348441,u1827,m120,RAY,"We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street."
62647,L348440,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,The hell you talking about? What train?
62648,L348439,u1827,m120,RAY,"That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now."
62649,L348438,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Say what?
62650,L348437,u1827,m120,RAY,We'll just get off at the next stop.
62651,L348436,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!"
62652,L348435,u1827,m120,RAY,"All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon."
62653,L348434,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
62654,L348433,u1827,m120,RAY,"Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure."
62655,L348414,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever."
62656,L348413,u1827,m120,RAY,"Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now..."
62657,L348412,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Don't mention it.
62658,L348399,u1827,m120,RAY,I'm stuck!
62659,L348398,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Come on, Ray, time to go!"
62660,L348396,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!"
62661,L348395,u1827,m120,RAY,I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
62662,L348394,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You drew this?!
62663,L348393,u1827,m120,RAY,Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
62664,L348392,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
62665,L348391,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Let me take a look at that map.
62666,L348390,u1827,m120,RAY,Absolutely. The map is very clear.
62667,L348389,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?"
62668,L348388,u1827,m120,RAY,"New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?"
62669,L348387,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!"
62670,L348379,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
62671,L348378,u1827,m120,RAY,I said you're soft.
62672,L348377,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What'd you say?
62673,L348376,u1827,m120,RAY,"I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft."
62674,L348375,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Does that mean I'm in?
62675,L348374,u1827,m120,RAY,"At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship."
62676,L348373,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,No.
62677,L348372,u1827,m120,RAY,"You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?"
62678,L348371,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places."
62679,L348370,u1827,m120,RAY,"Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard."
62680,L348369,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?"
62681,L348368,u1827,m120,RAY,On your behalf. What happened to we?
62682,L348367,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --"
62683,L348366,u1827,m120,RAY,"We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?"
62684,L348365,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it."
62685,L348364,u1827,m120,RAY,Yeah.
62686,L348363,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You still got that map?
62687,L348362,u1827,m120,RAY,"Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?"
62688,L348361,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --"
62689,L348360,u1827,m120,RAY,My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
62690,L348359,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
62691,L348358,u1827,m120,RAY,"What do you want, Claude?"
62692,L348357,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
62693,L348356,u1827,m120,RAY,Claude.
62694,L348355,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"What's up, Ray?"
62695,L348354,u1827,m120,RAY,I'm sure it don't.
62696,L348353,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
62697,L348352,u1827,m120,RAY,"Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law."
62698,L348312,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me."
62699,L348311,u1827,m120,RAY,"I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan."
62700,L348310,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Forget it.
62701,L348309,u1827,m120,RAY,What does that mean?
62702,L348308,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here."
62703,L348307,u1827,m120,RAY,"You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here."
62704,L348306,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us."
62705,L348305,u1827,m120,RAY,"What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this."
62706,L348304,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
62707,L348303,u1827,m120,RAY,That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
62708,L348302,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station."
62709,L348301,u1827,m120,RAY,You know what I'm saying.
62710,L348300,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,So?
62711,L348299,u1827,m120,RAY,Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
62712,L348220,u1827,m120,RAY,"Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails."
62713,L348219,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"No, man. I want you to have it."
62714,L348205,u1827,m120,RAY,He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
62715,L348204,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
62716,L348203,u1827,m120,RAY,I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
62717,L348192,u1827,m120,RAY,"What about you, Radio?"
62718,L348191,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?"
62719,L348184,u1827,m120,RAY,"The fork is the least of your worries, Claude."
62720,L348183,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,This fork is filthy.
62721,L348173,u1827,m120,RAY,He does it all by himself.
62722,L348172,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,So?
62723,L348171,u1827,m120,RAY,Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
62724,L348170,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
62725,L348126,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?"
62726,L348125,u1827,m120,RAY,I wouldn't do that if I was you.
62727,L348114,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
62728,L348113,u1827,m120,RAY,Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
62729,L348094,u1827,m120,RAY,"If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  ""I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."""
62730,L348093,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now."
62731,L348092,u1827,m120,RAY,"Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed."
62732,L348089,u1827,m120,RAY,"Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck."
62733,L348088,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us."
62734,L348086,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck."
62735,L348085,u1827,m120,RAY,Winston. His name's Winston.
62736,L348084,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name."
62737,L348080,u1827,m120,RAY,My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
62738,L348079,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What ain't there?
62739,L348078,u1827,m120,RAY,It ain't here.
62740,L348077,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
62741,L348076,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!"
62742,L348075,u1827,m120,RAY,He's dead.
62743,L348074,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I think he's hurt pretty bad.
62744,L348071,u1827,m120,RAY,We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
62745,L348070,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?"
62746,L348069,u1827,m120,RAY,He even got my daddy's watch.
62747,L348068,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You lost all our money in a card game?
62748,L348067,u1827,m120,RAY,"While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes."
62749,L348066,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What are you talking about?
62750,L348065,u1827,m120,RAY,"That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight."
62751,L348064,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
62752,L348063,u1827,m120,RAY,So you made a generous contribution.
62753,L348062,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short..."
62754,L348061,u1827,m120,RAY,That jelly you were talking to right here?
62755,L348060,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia."
62756,L348059,u1827,m120,RAY,Still got that ten dollars?
62757,L348058,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Guess we better get going, huh?"
62758,L348057,u1827,m120,RAY,Here I am.
62759,L348056,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you."
62760,L348023,u1827,m120,RAY,"There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash."
62761,L348022,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Reward?
62762,L348021,u1827,m120,RAY,"What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward."
62763,L348020,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
62764,L348019,u1827,m120,RAY,"Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking..."
62765,L348018,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!"
62766,L348017,u1827,m120,RAY,What gave you that idea?
62767,L348016,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?"
62768,L348003,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie."
62769,L348002,u1827,m120,RAY,"Yeah, I want some pie."
62770,L348001,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Alright. You want some pie?
62771,L348000,u1827,m120,RAY,"I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft."
62772,L347999,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Hey, man, don't ever call me that."
62773,L347998,u1827,m120,RAY,I said you're soft.
62774,L347997,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What'd you say?
62775,L347996,u1827,m120,RAY,You're soft.
62776,L347995,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
62777,L347994,u1827,m120,RAY,"Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude."
62778,L347990,u1827,m120,RAY,"Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way."
62779,L347989,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"You mean this sign? The one that says ""No Coloreds Allowed."" That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?"
62780,L347983,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now."
62781,L347982,u1827,m120,RAY,Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
62782,L347981,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Maybe we oughta find another place.
62783,L347979,u1827,m120,RAY,I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
62784,L347978,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Oooh...
62785,L347977,u1827,m120,RAY,"When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?"
62786,L347976,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,There is no Boom-Boom Room.
62787,L347975,u1827,m120,RAY,"Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room."
62788,L347974,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
62789,L347973,u1827,m120,RAY,"My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time."
62790,L347972,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
62791,L347971,u1827,m120,RAY,My daddy gave me this watch.
62792,L347970,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
62793,L347969,u1827,m120,RAY,Like this?
62794,L347968,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You need collateral.
62795,L347967,u1827,m120,RAY,"How would I get a loan, anyway?"
62796,L347966,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Uh-huh.
62797,L347965,u1827,m120,RAY,"So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?"
62798,L347964,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"That's right, a loan officer."
62799,L347963,u1827,m120,RAY,A loan officer?
62800,L347962,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
62801,L347961,u1827,m120,RAY,You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
62802,L347960,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
62803,L347959,u1827,m120,RAY,You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
62804,L347958,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
62805,L347957,u1827,m120,RAY,Why didn't you take it?
62806,L347956,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
62807,L347955,u1827,m120,RAY,"Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time."
62808,L347954,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you."
62809,L347953,u1827,m120,RAY,I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
62810,L347952,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"No, tell me what's so funny."
62811,L347951,u1827,m120,RAY,Nothing.
62812,L347950,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What?
62813,L347949,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay."
62814,L347948,u1827,m120,RAY,That's some long green.
62815,L347947,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars."
62816,L347946,u1827,m120,RAY,Start your job? What kind of job?
62817,L347945,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job."
62818,L347944,u1827,m120,RAY,"Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation."
62819,L347914,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?"
62820,L347913,u1827,m120,RAY,"You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb."
62821,L347912,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,What are they gonna do to us?
62822,L347911,u1827,m120,RAY,"I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man."
62823,L347910,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess."
62824,L347909,u1827,m120,RAY,Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
62825,L347908,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,"Where they taking us, anyway?"
62826,L347907,u1827,m120,RAY,"Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt."
62827,L347906,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I don't see where that's any of your business.
62828,L347905,u1827,m120,RAY,What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
62829,L347904,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Good old Monroe.
62830,L347903,u1827,m120,RAY,"Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it."
62831,L347892,u1827,m120,RAY,That's right! Good old Monroe...
62832,L347891,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You went to Monroe?
62833,L347890,u1827,m120,RAY,Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
62834,L347889,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,Claude Banks.
62835,L347888,u1827,m120,RAY,Sure I do. What's your name again?
62836,L347887,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I don't think so.
62837,L347886,u1827,m120,RAY,Don't I know you?
62838,L348166,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I try to moisturize regularly.
62839,L348165,u1819,m120,JANGLE LEG,Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
62840,L348164,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,'Preciate it. Claude.
62841,L348163,u1819,m120,JANGLE LEG,"Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg."
62842,L348162,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
62843,L348161,u1819,m120,JANGLE LEG,You ever done time before?
62844,L348160,u1811,m120,CLAUDE,I'm all right.
62845,L348159,u1819,m120,JANGLE LEG,How you doin'?
62846,L348339,u1827,m120,RAY,"No problem. Oh, boy!"
62847,L348338,u1812,m120,COOKIE,How about some steak sauce?
62848,L348337,u1827,m120,RAY,"Made just for you, Cookie."
62849,L348336,u1812,m120,COOKIE,"Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!"
62850,L348253,u1827,m120,RAY,"Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages."
62851,L348252,u1812,m120,COOKIE,You got your own nightclub?
62852,L348214,u1812,m120,COOKIE,Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
62853,L348213,u1827,m120,RAY,"Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?"
62854,L348199,u1827,m120,RAY,You killed Santa Claus?
62855,L348198,u1812,m120,COOKIE,At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
62856,L348177,u1812,m120,COOKIE,"Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs."
62857,L348176,u1827,m120,RAY,Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
62858,L348175,u1812,m120,COOKIE,"Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise."
62859,L348174,u1827,m120,RAY,What is that?
62860,L348537,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,You heard what the man said! Move it!
62861,L348536,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!"
62862,L348469,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line..."
62863,L348468,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,"We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss."
62864,L348386,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,"Movin' it out, boss."
62865,L348385,u1814,m120,DILLARD,Move it out.
62866,L348384,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,"All in, boss!"
62867,L348293,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,You heard the boss! Let's move!
62868,L348292,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it."
62869,L348143,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast."
62870,L348142,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,Judge gave 'em the long ride.
62871,L348141,u1814,m120,DILLARD,Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
62872,L348139,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here."
62873,L348138,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,"He's from New York City. That one, too."
62874,L348135,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
62875,L348134,u1814,m120,DILLARD,Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
62876,L348133,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,"Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!"
62877,L348132,u1814,m120,DILLARD,"Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments."
62878,L348129,u1817,m120,HOPPIN' BOB,Why ain't that pick swinging?
62879,L348128,u1814,m120,DILLARD,Why ain't his pick swinging?
62880,L348334,u1827,m120,RAY,"C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door."
62881,L348333,u1816,m120,GOLDMOUTH,"Where am I at, man?"
62882,L348332,u1816,m120,GOLDMOUTH,"Hey, Ray..."
62883,L348331,u1827,m120,RAY,"That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room."
62884,L348327,u1827,m120,RAY,He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
62885,L348326,u1816,m120,GOLDMOUTH,You mean Louis Armstrong?
62886,L348255,u1827,m120,RAY,"Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream."
62887,L348254,u1816,m120,GOLDMOUTH,So it don't exist.
62888,L348222,u1827,m120,RAY,"My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread."
62889,L348221,u1816,m120,GOLDMOUTH,Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
62890,L348824,u1820,m120,LEON,"I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with."
62891,L348823,u1818,m120,JAKE,What do you think about that?
62892,L348816,u1818,m120,JAKE,"Hell, no! I just got something in my eye."
62893,L348815,u1820,m120,LEON,"Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?"
62894,L348768,u1820,m120,LEON,"What happened to 'em after that, Willie?"
62895,L348767,u1818,m120,JAKE,That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
62896,L348763,u1818,m120,JAKE,"Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?"
62897,L348762,u1820,m120,LEON,"No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?"
62898,L348761,u1818,m120,JAKE,"So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?"
62899,L347846,u1818,m120,JAKE,"I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty."
62900,L347845,u1820,m120,LEON,Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
62901,L347844,u1820,m120,LEON,"Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up."
62902,L347843,u1818,m120,JAKE,"Hey, the dude's holdin'."
62903,L348819,u1832,m120,WILLIE,"Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning."
62904,L348818,u1820,m120,LEON,"Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?"
62905,L348817,u1832,m120,WILLIE,It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
62906,L348766,u1832,m120,WILLIE,Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
62907,L348765,u1820,m120,LEON,Just like Elvis.
62908,L348764,u1832,m120,WILLIE,Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
62909,L347848,u1820,m120,LEON,"What were they, bootleggers?"
62910,L347847,u1832,m120,WILLIE,Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
62911,L347842,u1832,m120,WILLIE,"Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys."
62912,L347841,u1820,m120,LEON,"1932? That's like, that's like..."
62913,L347840,u1832,m120,WILLIE,I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
62914,L347839,u1820,m120,LEON,"Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time."
62915,L348281,u1822,m120,MAMA GIBSON,"I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too."
62916,L348280,u1827,m120,RAY,"They gave me life, mama."
62917,L348279,u1822,m120,MAMA GIBSON,"Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different."
62918,L348278,u1827,m120,RAY,"I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy."
62919,L348277,u1822,m120,MAMA GIBSON,Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
62920,L348276,u1827,m120,RAY,"I can't take that, mama."
62921,L348275,u1822,m120,MAMA GIBSON,"Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more."
62922,L348274,u1827,m120,RAY,"Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall."
62923,L348273,u1822,m120,MAMA GIBSON,"Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this."
62924,L348261,u1827,m120,RAY,"Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg."
62925,L348260,u1822,m120,MAMA GIBSON,I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
62926,L348259,u1827,m120,RAY,"What are you doing here, mama?"
62927,L348258,u1822,m120,MAMA GIBSON,Rayford!
62928,L348257,u1827,m120,RAY,Mama?
62929,L348810,u1827,m120,RAY,I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
62930,L348809,u1823,m120,NURSE HUMPHRIES,"You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!"
62931,L348808,u1827,m120,RAY,It'll be too late.
62932,L348807,u1823,m120,NURSE HUMPHRIES,Wait for the firemen!
62933,L348806,u1827,m120,RAY,He must still be in there.
62934,L348805,u1823,m120,NURSE HUMPHRIES,"Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?"
62935,L348804,u1827,m120,RAY,"Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!"
62936,L348803,u1823,m120,NURSE HUMPHRIES,Is everyone here?
62937,L348741,u1824,m120,PIKE,What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
62938,L348740,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?"
62939,L348736,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?"
62940,L348735,u1824,m120,PIKE,"He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins."
62941,L348727,u1824,m120,PIKE,I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
62942,L348726,u1831,m120,WILKINS,What's going on here?
62943,L348714,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict."
62944,L348713,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Respect? Well, isn't that progressive."
62945,L348712,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean."
62946,L348711,u1824,m120,PIKE,"If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy."
62947,L348708,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight."
62948,L348707,u1824,m120,PIKE,"You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick."
62949,L348706,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots."
62950,L348705,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Well, fortunately, I carry my own."
62951,L348704,u1831,m120,WILKINS,"I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house."
62952,L348703,u1824,m120,PIKE,I prefer bourbon.
62953,L348702,u1831,m120,WILKINS,Lemonade?
62954,L348739,u1827,m120,RAY,"He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it."
62955,L348738,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!"
62956,L348737,u1827,m120,RAY,That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
62957,L348732,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Shoot him, Wilkins!"
62958,L348731,u1827,m120,RAY,I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
62959,L348725,u1827,m120,RAY,Like you shot Winston Hancock?
62960,L348724,u1824,m120,PIKE,"I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy."
62961,L348723,u1827,m120,RAY,"She give you that scar, too?"
62962,L348722,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Something like that, yes."
62963,L348721,u1827,m120,RAY,Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
62964,L348720,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back."
62965,L348719,u1827,m120,RAY,Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
62966,L348718,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore."
62967,L348717,u1827,m120,RAY,"That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune."
62968,L348716,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath."
62969,L348107,u1824,m120,PIKE,"You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously."
62970,L348106,u1827,m120,RAY,I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
62971,L348105,u1824,m120,PIKE,Are you offering me a bribe?
62972,L348104,u1827,m120,RAY,"Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean."
62973,L348101,u1827,m120,RAY,"Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York."
62974,L348100,u1824,m120,PIKE,"Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?"
62975,L348325,u1827,m120,RAY,Satchmo.
62976,L348324,u1825,m120,POKER FACE,Who?
62977,L348247,u1827,m120,RAY,"They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too."
62978,L348246,u1825,m120,POKER FACE,"Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?"
62979,L348158,u1827,m120,RAY,Anybody else need anything read?
62980,L348157,u1825,m120,POKER FACE,Appreciate it.
62981,L348154,u1827,m120,RAY,"No, it says Marleen here."
62982,L348153,u1825,m120,POKER FACE,Jenny?
62983,L348152,u1827,m120,RAY,"Apparently, your sister died."
62984,L348321,u1827,m120,RAY,"You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun."
62985,L348320,u1826,m120,RADIO,That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
62986,L348319,u1827,m120,RAY,You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
62987,L348318,u1826,m120,RADIO,"Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?"
62988,L348249,u1827,m120,RAY,Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
62989,L348248,u1826,m120,RADIO,"Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?"
62990,L348210,u1827,m120,RAY,"Greenville, that the nearest town?"
62991,L348209,u1826,m120,RADIO,"Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville."
62992,L348607,u1827,m120,RAY,I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
62993,L348606,u1832,m120,WILLIE,"They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither."
62994,L348605,u1827,m120,RAY,"Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular."
62995,L348323,u1827,m120,RAY,I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
62996,L348322,u1832,m120,WILLIE,"Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?"
62997,L348251,u1827,m120,RAY,That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
62998,L348250,u1832,m120,WILLIE,What's the Boom Boom Room?
62999,L348208,u1832,m120,WILLIE,They run but they never get too far.
63000,L348207,u1827,m120,RAY,You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
63001,L348206,u1832,m120,WILLIE,Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
63002,L348188,u1832,m120,WILLIE,That's a long story...
63003,L348187,u1827,m120,RAY,"What are you in for, Willie?"
63004,L348186,u1832,m120,WILLIE,Me? Willie Long.
63005,L348185,u1827,m120,RAY,What's your name?
63006,L348015,u1827,m120,RAY,Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
63007,L348014,u1828,m120,SLIM,"Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out."
63008,L348013,u1827,m120,RAY,Blacks welcome there?
63009,L348012,u1828,m120,SLIM,That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
63010,L348011,u1827,m120,RAY,"Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?"
63011,L348009,u1828,m120,SLIM,You found him.
63012,L348008,u1827,m120,RAY,How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
63013,L347940,u1827,m120,RAY,I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
63014,L347939,u1829,m120,SPANKY,"If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot."
63015,L347938,u1827,m120,RAY,"I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind."
63016,L347937,u1829,m120,SPANKY,"Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going."
63017,L347936,u1827,m120,RAY,Understood.
63018,L347935,u1829,m120,SPANKY,"If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense."
63019,L347934,u1827,m120,RAY,"All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving."
63020,L347933,u1829,m120,SPANKY,I'm interested. Keep talking.
63021,L347932,u1827,m120,RAY,"Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner."
63022,L347931,u1829,m120,SPANKY,Where'd you get this?
63023,L347930,u1827,m120,RAY,Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
63024,L347929,u1829,m120,SPANKY,"What's that, some of your bathtub brew?"
63025,L347927,u1827,m120,RAY,"Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out."
63026,L347926,u1829,m120,SPANKY,"But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself."
63027,L347925,u1827,m120,RAY,"You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with."
63028,L350818,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Absolutely not.
63029,L350817,u1846,m121,NICKY,Now will you get in the flask?
63030,L350806,u1846,m121,NICKY,No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
63031,L350805,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Is this a joke?
63032,L350804,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask."
63033,L350803,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Little Nicky.
63034,L350740,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?"
63035,L350739,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
63036,L350657,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,I hear a train coming. Drink.
63037,L350656,u1846,m121,NICKY,Let her go.
63038,L350655,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going."
63039,L350383,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
63040,L350382,u1846,m121,NICKY,Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
63041,L350381,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
63042,L350380,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies."
63043,L350379,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,He's sick?
63044,L350378,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick."
63045,L350375,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Please, get out of my mind!"
63046,L350374,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,You shouldn't have come here.
63047,L350373,u1846,m121,NICKY,ADRIAN!
63048,L350864,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,Don't do it!
63049,L350863,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,No!
63050,L350825,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear."
63051,L350824,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,"Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open."
63052,L350650,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,You mother...
63053,L350649,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan."
63054,L350648,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,All right. Let me out.
63055,L350647,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"Hello, Cassius."
63056,L350249,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
63057,L350248,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
63058,L350247,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,I lowered the drinking age to ten.
63059,L350246,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?"
63060,L350245,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,"""Let the sin begins"" -- that was a good one."
63061,L350127,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"It's our time, brother."
63062,L350126,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,...their damned souls will be ours.
63063,L350125,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them..."
63064,L350124,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
63065,L350123,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,We could create our own hell there.
63066,L350122,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,What do you think about... Earth?
63067,L350121,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
63068,L350120,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Could you concentrate for five seconds?
63069,L350119,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,That's what I thought!
63070,L350116,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,"Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!"
63071,L350115,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here."
63072,L350114,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,It's just such a slap in the face.
63073,L350113,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,And he's dead serious.
63074,L350112,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,"You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that."
63075,L350067,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
63076,L350066,u1837,m121,CASSIUS,I knew it. He's finally retiring.
63077,L350802,u1843,m121,JOHN,You want a queen? Got one right here.
63078,L350801,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
63079,L350645,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"I'm calling you out, brother..."
63080,L350644,u1843,m121,JOHN,Urr... uggg... errr...
63081,L350643,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello..."
63082,L350642,u1843,m121,JOHN,Uh. No it won't?
63083,L350641,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
63084,L350640,u1843,m121,JOHN,And give you a good buzz.
63085,L350637,u1843,m121,JOHN,"Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine."
63086,L350636,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
63087,L350624,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,"Sure, why not?"
63088,L350623,u1843,m121,JOHN,But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
63089,L350619,u1843,m121,JOHN,Noon...
63090,L350618,u1834,m121,ADRIAN,Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
63091,L350763,u1835,m121,ANGEL,I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
63092,L350762,u1838,m121,CHRISTA,"She goes to Parson's, right?"
63093,L350737,u1838,m121,CHRISTA,Show him Central Park.
63094,L350736,u1835,m121,ANGEL,All these good people have totally been led astray.
63095,L350731,u1838,m121,CHRISTA,"You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life."
63096,L350730,u1835,m121,ANGEL,I'll call her later.
63097,L350723,u1835,m121,ANGEL,Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
63098,L350722,u1838,m121,CHRISTA,"I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris."
63099,L350665,u1838,m121,CHRISTA,So excited.
63100,L350664,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now."
63101,L350785,u1835,m121,ANGEL,You're already there...
63102,L350784,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane."
63103,L350783,u1835,m121,ANGEL,It would be so okay.
63104,L350782,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?"
63105,L350776,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do."
63106,L350775,u1846,m121,NICKY,What is it?
63107,L350773,u1846,m121,NICKY,A speech impediment?
63108,L350772,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have."
63109,L350771,u1846,m121,NICKY,But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
63110,L350765,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"Yeah, you do..."
63111,L350764,u1846,m121,NICKY,I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
63112,L350761,u1835,m121,ANGEL,She's so nice.
63113,L350760,u1846,m121,NICKY,Valerie's crying!
63114,L350735,u1835,m121,ANGEL,We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
63115,L350734,u1846,m121,NICKY,How did you see me?
63116,L350729,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Well tell her I said ""hi"" back."
63117,L350728,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says ""hi."""
63118,L350721,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer."
63119,L350720,u1846,m121,NICKY,Where did you meet my father?
63120,L350685,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"Angels don't get any older, son."
63121,L350684,u1846,m121,NICKY,How come you're not older?
63122,L350680,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair."
63123,L350679,u1846,m121,NICKY,Wow. What... what did she look like?
63124,L350678,u1835,m121,ANGEL,Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
63125,L350677,u1846,m121,NICKY,An angel?
63126,L350676,u1835,m121,ANGEL,Try an angel.
63127,L350675,u1846,m121,NICKY,My mom wasn't a goat?
63128,L350674,u1835,m121,ANGEL,A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
63129,L350673,u1846,m121,NICKY,My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
63130,L350672,u1835,m121,ANGEL,"Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?"
63131,L350671,u1835,m121,ANGEL,Maybe try the opposite of that.
63132,L350670,u1846,m121,NICKY,"The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks..."
63133,L350800,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"That turn you on there, RuPaul?"
63134,L350799,u1851,m121,TODD,"Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit."
63135,L350759,u1836,m121,BEEFY,I can't screw.  I can't screw.
63136,L350758,u1851,m121,TODD,"They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke."
63137,L350612,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid."
63138,L350611,u1851,m121,TODD,Where is he? He's late.
63139,L350432,u1836,m121,BEEFY,No.
63140,L350431,u1851,m121,TODD,Did you just talk?
63141,L350430,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
63142,L350429,u1851,m121,TODD,What's Nicky doing down there?
63143,L350567,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
63144,L350566,u1846,m121,NICKY,This is baloney!
63145,L350562,u1836,m121,BEEFY,I think you're looking at him.
63146,L350561,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him."
63147,L350560,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Look. You were really high. Things happen.
63148,L350559,u1846,m121,NICKY,I didn't murder anybody
63149,L350556,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look."
63150,L350555,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I seem to be in trouble, Beefy."
63151,L350486,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
63152,L350485,u1846,m121,NICKY,We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
63153,L350407,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores."
63154,L350406,u1846,m121,NICKY,Release the evil?
63155,L350405,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you."
63156,L350404,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"""But those are my roommate's sodas..."" Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?"
63157,L350403,u1846,m121,NICKY,But those are my roommate's sodas...
63158,L350402,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Go get a soda out of the fridge.
63159,L350401,u1846,m121,NICKY,Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
63160,L350400,u1836,m121,BEEFY,You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
63161,L350399,u1846,m121,NICKY,What can I do about it?
63162,L350398,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
63163,L350264,u1836,m121,BEEFY,I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
63164,L350263,u1846,m121,NICKY,All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
63165,L350254,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Well, let's rock and roll."
63166,L350253,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking."
63167,L350252,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Okay, just point me in the right direction next time."
63168,L350251,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet."
63169,L350250,u1846,m121,NICKY,This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
63170,L350233,u1846,m121,NICKY,Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
63171,L350232,u1836,m121,BEEFY,You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
63172,L350217,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
63173,L350216,u1846,m121,NICKY,From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
63174,L350209,u1846,m121,NICKY,I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
63175,L350208,u1836,m121,BEEFY,It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
63176,L350207,u1846,m121,NICKY,Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
63177,L350204,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Put it in your mouth.
63178,L350203,u1846,m121,NICKY,"So far, so good. Now what?"
63179,L350202,u1836,m121,BEEFY,That pain is hunger.
63180,L350201,u1846,m121,NICKY,I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
63181,L350200,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes."
63182,L350199,u1846,m121,NICKY,"It's freezing up here, Beefy."
63183,L350198,u1836,m121,BEEFY,Makin' friends already.
63184,L350194,u1846,m121,NICKY,Oh. Sorry.
63185,L350193,u1836,m121,BEEFY,"It's not me, moron."
63186,L350192,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Okay, ""bro,"" this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there."
63187,L350191,u1836,m121,BEEFY,It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
63188,L350190,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy."
63189,L350189,u1836,m121,BEEFY,My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
63190,L350161,u1839,m121,DAD,"Sure, pop. Whatever you want."
63191,L350160,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
63192,L350159,u1839,m121,DAD,"Please, pop, just go back to your room."
63193,L350158,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
63194,L350157,u1839,m121,DAD,"Everything's fine, pop."
63195,L350156,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
63196,L350144,u1839,m121,DAD,Now you're talking.
63197,L350143,u1840,m121,DAN,"This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!"
63198,L350142,u1839,m121,DAD,"Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that."
63199,L350141,u1840,m121,DAN,You did it for Namath.
63200,L350140,u1839,m121,DAD,"In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino."
63201,L350139,u1840,m121,DAN,"C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring."
63202,L350138,u1839,m121,DAD,"I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline."
63203,L350596,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,"He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!"
63204,L350595,u1839,m121,DAD,Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
63205,L350594,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,Check one-two. Check one-two.
63206,L350591,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,"Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!"
63207,L350590,u1839,m121,DAD,I got no ears! I can't hear!
63208,L350099,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,"Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock."
63209,L350098,u1839,m121,DAD,"No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go."
63210,L350097,u1839,m121,DAD,"Yes, Jimmy."
63211,L350096,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,"Knock, knock."
63212,L350859,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home..."
63213,L350858,u1839,m121,DAD,"Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle."
63214,L350854,u1839,m121,DAD,"Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you."
63215,L350853,u1846,m121,NICKY,What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
63216,L350852,u1839,m121,DAD,"You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth."
63217,L350851,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad."
63218,L350850,u1839,m121,DAD,"You came through, Nicky."
63219,L350593,u1839,m121,DAD,"I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!"
63220,L350592,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?"
63221,L350589,u1839,m121,DAD,"What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear..."
63222,L350588,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?"
63223,L350186,u1839,m121,DAD,"Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry."
63224,L350185,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one."
63225,L350184,u1839,m121,DAD,"That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them."
63226,L350180,u1839,m121,DAD,"Son, just do your best."
63227,L350179,u1846,m121,NICKY,No. This can't be happening.
63228,L350175,u1846,m121,NICKY,Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
63229,L350174,u1839,m121,DAD,"Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here."
63230,L350168,u1839,m121,DAD,I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
63231,L350167,u1846,m121,NICKY,"So go get 'em, Dad!"
63232,L350166,u1839,m121,DAD,To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
63233,L350155,u1839,m121,DAD,"I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing."
63234,L350154,u1846,m121,NICKY,How bad?
63235,L350153,u1839,m121,DAD,"This is bad, Nicky."
63236,L350146,u1839,m121,DAD,And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
63237,L350145,u1846,m121,NICKY,"You're a good devil, Dad."
63238,L350137,u1839,m121,DAD,I was just playing with you.
63239,L350136,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Metallica, Dad. Come on."
63240,L350135,u1839,m121,DAD,"Who is this, Metal-lick-a?"
63241,L350134,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester."
63242,L350133,u1839,m121,DAD,"I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?"
63243,L350132,u1846,m121,NICKY,Definitely.
63244,L350131,u1839,m121,DAD,"Now that was an experience. ""You are only coming through in waves."" That line blows my mind every time."
63245,L350106,u1839,m121,DAD,The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
63246,L350105,u1846,m121,NICKY,I mean... tough break.
63247,L350102,u1839,m121,DAD,"Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me."
63248,L350101,u1846,m121,NICKY,Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
63249,L350100,u1839,m121,DAD,"This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so..."
63250,L350093,u1839,m121,DAD,"Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later."
63251,L350092,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece."
63252,L350091,u1839,m121,DAD,Now everybody sit down.
63253,L350088,u1839,m121,DAD,"Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?"
63254,L350087,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture."
63255,L350260,u1846,m121,NICKY,Beast.
63256,L350259,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,Bus?
63257,L350215,u1846,m121,NICKY,You got it.
63258,L350214,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
63259,L350213,u1846,m121,NICKY,Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
63260,L350212,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,Thanks.
63261,L350211,u1846,m121,NICKY,That's a pretty brassiere.
63262,L350210,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,Hey.
63263,L350152,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,That's what I'm thinkin'...
63264,L350151,u1846,m121,NICKY,Coulda been much worse.
63265,L350150,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,"I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?"
63266,L350355,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,"I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything..."
63267,L350354,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,"That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?"
63268,L350353,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,Boogerland!
63269,L350352,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,"What was it called, sir."
63270,L350351,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
63271,L350350,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,"It's Stanley, sir."
63272,L350349,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,"You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?"
63273,L350347,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,"I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup."
63274,L350346,u1841,m121,GATEKEEPER,"I know, your wickedness."
63275,L350345,u1845,m121,LUCIFER,"You know, I was the one who created Hell."
63276,L350183,u1846,m121,NICKY,I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
63277,L350182,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
63278,L350173,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
63279,L350172,u1846,m121,NICKY,I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
63280,L350171,u1846,m121,NICKY,You're not saying it's up to me?
63281,L350170,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,"I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers."
63282,L350169,u1846,m121,NICKY,"So go get 'em, Jimmy!"
63283,L350165,u1846,m121,NICKY,We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
63284,L350164,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
63285,L350065,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!"
63286,L350064,u1842,m121,JIMMY THE DEMON,Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
63287,L350063,u1846,m121,NICKY,Hey...
63288,L350795,u1843,m121,JOHN,"Of course you do, Tommy Tune."
63289,L350794,u1851,m121,TODD,His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
63290,L350484,u1851,m121,TODD,"Oh, would you grow up."
63291,L350483,u1843,m121,JOHN,"Easy, Liberace."
63292,L350478,u1851,m121,TODD,No.
63293,L350477,u1843,m121,JOHN,"By she, do you mean he?"
63294,L350476,u1851,m121,TODD,I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
63295,L350464,u1851,m121,TODD,I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
63296,L350463,u1843,m121,JOHN,No wonder your uncle's so weird...
63297,L350757,u1843,m121,JOHN,Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
63298,L350756,u1847,m121,PETER,This don't look good.
63299,L350631,u1847,m121,PETER,Peppermint... alright.
63300,L350630,u1843,m121,JOHN,Schnapps...
63301,L350600,u1847,m121,PETER,We know where to find Nicky.
63302,L350599,u1843,m121,JOHN,Looking for the chief.
63303,L350598,u1843,m121,JOHN,Little nervous. Wanna puke.
63304,L350597,u1847,m121,PETER,You sure you're down with this?
63305,L350490,u1847,m121,PETER,"We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?"
63306,L350489,u1843,m121,JOHN,"That's a big pass, Elton John."
63307,L350428,u1843,m121,JOHN,"Six, six, six, pick up sticks."
63308,L350427,u1847,m121,PETER,Look who's back from the dead.
63309,L350281,u1843,m121,JOHN,The Dark Prince is here.
63310,L350280,u1847,m121,PETER,Did you check out the dragon mouth?
63311,L350274,u1843,m121,JOHN,Yeah. You do it.
63312,L350273,u1847,m121,PETER,Should we wake him up?
63313,L350272,u1843,m121,JOHN,"Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off."
63314,L350271,u1847,m121,PETER,Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
63315,L350270,u1843,m121,JOHN,What's with that guy?
63316,L350269,u1847,m121,PETER,Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
63317,L350268,u1843,m121,JOHN,There's our man.
63318,L350267,u1843,m121,JOHN,'Bout time...
63319,L350266,u1847,m121,PETER,Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
63320,L350493,u1846,m121,NICKY,"See ya, fellas."
63321,L350492,u1843,m121,JOHN,"Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on."
63322,L350491,u1846,m121,NICKY,No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
63323,L350468,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts."
63324,L350467,u1843,m121,JOHN,Come on. One more time.
63325,L350461,u1846,m121,NICKY,Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
63326,L350460,u1843,m121,JOHN,What's Ozzy trying to say there?
63327,L350278,u1843,m121,JOHN,That way.
63328,L350277,u1846,m121,NICKY,Which way did he go?
63329,L350397,u1848,m121,REGIS,I was DeNiro!
63330,L350396,u1844,m121,KATHY LEE,"Yes, great movie..."
63331,L350395,u1848,m121,REGIS,"Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?"
63332,L350394,u1844,m121,KATHY LEE,You keep a bat under your seat?
63333,L350393,u1848,m121,REGIS,"I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat."
63334,L350392,u1844,m121,KATHY LEE,You followed him?
63335,L350391,u1848,m121,REGIS,So I followed him...
63336,L350390,u1844,m121,KATHY LEE,"Oh, that's terrible, Reege..."
63337,L350389,u1848,m121,REGIS,"So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off..."
63338,L350842,u1846,m121,NICKY,I'll just go to Heaven.
63339,L350841,u1847,m121,PETER,You gotta kill yourself.
63340,L350580,u1846,m121,NICKY,Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
63341,L350579,u1847,m121,PETER,Dude. Seriously?
63342,L350578,u1846,m121,NICKY,Good idea... kill me.
63343,L350570,u1847,m121,PETER,"Dude, it's us. Let us in."
63344,L350569,u1846,m121,NICKY,I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
63345,L350470,u1846,m121,NICKY,All right...
63346,L350469,u1847,m121,PETER,Please. You got to.
63347,L350524,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?"
63348,L350523,u1850,m121,STUDENT,"You got the wrong window again, man."
63349,L350506,u1850,m121,STUDENT,Andrew.
63350,L350505,u1846,m121,NICKY,Adrian?
63351,L350504,u1850,m121,STUDENT,I don't need luck. I'm good.
63352,L350503,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking."
63353,L350502,u1850,m121,STUDENT,"Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over."
63354,L350501,u1846,m121,NICKY,No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
63355,L350500,u1850,m121,STUDENT,"It's ""Comptoir Sud Pacific."" Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?"
63356,L350499,u1846,m121,NICKY,You smell like coconuts.
63357,L350498,u1850,m121,STUDENT,Hello.
63358,L350848,u1846,m121,NICKY,I love you.
63359,L350847,u1852,m121,VALERIE,I love you.
63360,L350846,u1846,m121,NICKY,Do me.
63361,L350831,u1846,m121,NICKY,From my dad's side of the family.
63362,L350830,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
63363,L350828,u1846,m121,NICKY,That was Cassius!
63364,L350827,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Nicky!
63365,L350659,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I have to, Valerie."
63366,L350658,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Don't do it.
63367,L350548,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"""Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."""
63368,L350547,u1846,m121,NICKY,I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
63369,L350546,u1846,m121,NICKY,East Rutherford.
63370,L350545,u1852,m121,VALERIE,We're going to Jersey?
63371,L350544,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine."
63372,L350543,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Can we go fly over Central Park?
63373,L350537,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"Okay, I do. Get back up here."
63374,L350536,u1846,m121,NICKY,You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
63375,L350533,u1846,m121,NICKY,"...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you."
63376,L350532,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"...""The Devil?""..."
63377,L350531,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad..."
63378,L350530,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Yes...
63379,L350529,u1846,m121,NICKY,Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
63380,L350528,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"What do you mean, ""possessed?"""
63381,L350527,u1846,m121,NICKY,"That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig."
63382,L350526,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger."
63383,L350521,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
63384,L350520,u1846,m121,NICKY,I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
63385,L350519,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Why would you be floating?
63386,L350518,u1846,m121,NICKY,I think I'm floating.
63387,L350517,u1852,m121,VALERIE,What are you doing?
63388,L350516,u1846,m121,NICKY,No.
63389,L350515,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Are you dead?
63390,L350514,u1846,m121,NICKY,Valerie?
63391,L350511,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison."
63392,L350510,u1852,m121,VALERIE,What were you thinking coming here?
63393,L350508,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
63394,L350507,u1846,m121,NICKY,Hey.
63395,L350370,u1846,m121,NICKY,I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
63396,L350369,u1852,m121,VALERIE,What was that?
63397,L350368,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Your juicy, heart-shaped ass."
63398,L350367,u1852,m121,VALERIE,What?
63399,L350366,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?"
63400,L350365,u1852,m121,VALERIE,You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
63401,L350364,u1846,m121,NICKY,Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
63402,L350363,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"Basically, yeah."
63403,L350362,u1846,m121,NICKY,"So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?"
63404,L350343,u1846,m121,NICKY,Good. I was concerned.
63405,L350342,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"Sometimes, sure."
63406,L350341,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?"
63407,L350339,u1852,m121,VALERIE,My perfume?
63408,L350338,u1846,m121,NICKY,"What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?"
63409,L350337,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty."
63410,L350336,u1846,m121,NICKY,School?
63411,L350335,u1852,m121,VALERIE,I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
63412,L350332,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts."
63413,L350331,u1852,m121,VALERIE,You have a dog? What kind?
63414,L350330,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though."
63415,L350329,u1852,m121,VALERIE,This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
63416,L350327,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it."
63417,L350326,u1846,m121,NICKY,It's freezing my hands.
63418,L350325,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Uh, it's a deep south expression."
63419,L350324,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"""Octopus people?"""
63420,L350323,u1846,m121,NICKY,Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
63421,L350322,u1852,m121,VALERIE,If you want to.
63422,L350321,u1846,m121,NICKY,Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
63423,L350320,u1852,m121,VALERIE,That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
63424,L350319,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'."
63425,L350318,u1852,m121,VALERIE,"Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out."
63426,L350317,u1846,m121,NICKY,"If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do."
63427,L350316,u1852,m121,VALERIE,I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
63428,L350315,u1846,m121,NICKY,"My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart."
63429,L350314,u1852,m121,VALERIE,My dad's an optometrist.
63430,L350313,u1846,m121,NICKY,"I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them."
63431,L350312,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Why are you laughing?
63432,L350311,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why."
63433,L350310,u1852,m121,VALERIE,Really?
63434,L350309,u1846,m121,NICKY,The South.
63435,L350308,u1852,m121,VALERIE,I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
63436,L350307,u1846,m121,NICKY,You think I'm a tourist?
63437,L350306,u1852,m121,VALERIE,That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
63438,L350305,u1846,m121,NICKY,That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
63439,L350583,u1851,m121,TODD,I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
63440,L350582,u1846,m121,NICKY,That just hurt a lot.
63441,L350482,u1851,m121,TODD,Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
63442,L350481,u1846,m121,NICKY,"A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie."
63443,L350419,u1846,m121,NICKY,"If it's Cassius, yes."
63444,L350418,u1851,m121,TODD,A black guy?
63445,L350417,u1846,m121,NICKY,It looks like the work of a brother...
63446,L350231,u1851,m121,TODD,"And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed."
63447,L350230,u1846,m121,NICKY,I don't know.
63448,L350229,u1851,m121,TODD,Why is that funny?
63449,L350228,u1846,m121,NICKY,Yeah. The deep South.
63450,L350227,u1851,m121,TODD,It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
63451,L350226,u1846,m121,NICKY,No.
63452,L350225,u1851,m121,TODD,"Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?"
63453,L350224,u1846,m121,NICKY,Off limits.
63454,L350223,u1851,m121,TODD,"Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits."
63455,L350222,u1846,m121,NICKY,Yes. What is rent?
63456,L350221,u1851,m121,TODD,"Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?"
63457,L350220,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?"
63458,L350295,u1846,m121,NICKY,"Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten."
63459,L350294,u1849,m121,STREET VENDOR,"Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!"
63460,L350288,u1846,m121,NICKY,I don't know?
63461,L350287,u1849,m121,STREET VENDOR,"And if that is your so-called ""flask,"" how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?"
63462,L350286,u1846,m121,NICKY,"No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask."
63463,L350285,u1849,m121,STREET VENDOR,"You callin' me a thief, my man?"
63464,L350284,u1846,m121,NICKY,Yes. I would like my flask back.
63465,L350283,u1849,m121,STREET VENDOR,"See something you like, my man?"
63466,L350282,u1846,m121,NICKY,Hey...
63467,L352677,u1853,m122,BILLY,Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
63468,L352676,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!"
63469,L352675,u1853,m122,BILLY,Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
63470,L352674,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
63471,L352673,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"No, for you! How old are you, Billy?"
63472,L352672,u1853,m122,BILLY,"For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!"
63473,L352671,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"I feel sorry for you, boy!"
63474,L352670,u1853,m122,BILLY,"I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did."
63475,L352669,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'm a Sandman!
63476,L352890,u1854,m122,BOX,"Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea."
63477,L352889,u1859,m122,LOGAN,What other food?
63478,L352888,u1854,m122,BOX,Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
63479,L352887,u1859,m122,LOGAN,How did they get in here?

63484,L352876,u1859,m122,LOGAN,How do you want us?

63486,L352872,u1854,m122,BOX,"Nude. Imagine, a pair."
63487,L352871,u1859,m122,LOGAN,That's better.  How do you want us?
63488,L352870,u1854,m122,BOX,Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
63489,L352869,u1859,m122,LOGAN,There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
63490,L352868,u1854,m122,BOX,Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.

63492,L352864,u1854,m122,BOX,You're a beautiful pair.

63508,L352843,u1854,m122,BOX,Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
63509,L352751,u1855,m122,DOC,Hurry... hurry... hurry.
63510,L352750,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I don't care... Just get it over with.
63511,L352749,u1855,m122,DOC,Do you have anything special in mind?
63512,L352735,u1855,m122,DOC,"Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me."
63513,L352734,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Just the face.
63514,L352733,u1855,m122,DOC,I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
63515,L352732,u1855,m122,DOC,And I did it myself right on there.
63516,L352731,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Your own work?
63517,L352730,u1855,m122,DOC,I am.
63518,L352729,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
63519,L352728,u1855,m122,DOC,"It's a real privilege, Sandman."
63520,L353025,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Why did you do that???!!!
63521,L353024,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that..."
63522,L353023,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Why did you do that??!!
63523,L352767,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!"
63524,L352766,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It has nothing to do with you.
63525,L352765,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"What's going on, Logan?!"
63526,L352559,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,At Carousel tonight?
63527,L352558,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'm fine...  See you...
63528,L352557,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
63529,L352556,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Anybody we know?
63530,L352555,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Of course.
63531,L352554,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Did you?
63532,L352553,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
63533,L352552,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Did you ever see anybody renew?
63534,L352551,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,What the hell took you so long?
63535,L352523,u1859,m122,LOGAN,No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
63536,L352522,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,You? Why? You're already beautiful.
63537,L352521,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
63538,L352460,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?"
63539,L352459,u1859,m122,LOGAN,That was a great shot you made.
63540,L352457,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,I'm in my party mood.
63541,L352456,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Who invited you?
63542,L352449,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Only a few? You're just not trying.
63543,L352448,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
63544,L352444,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think..."
63545,L352443,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --"
63546,L352442,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman."
63547,L352441,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
63548,L352439,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Well... you can't have them all.
63549,L352438,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,You missed something special.
63550,L352425,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Of course not! I'm curious, not sick."
63551,L352424,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
63552,L352423,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?"
63553,L352422,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Did you ever see Francis-8?
63554,L352416,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman."
63555,L352415,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that ""one for one"" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape."
63556,L352414,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?"
63557,L352413,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. ""One for one. One for one."""
63558,L352412,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?"
63559,L352411,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Just wondered... what happens?
63560,L352410,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Why?
63561,L352409,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Not in my time...
63562,L352408,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
63563,L352407,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
63564,L352404,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Even the alarm didn't wake him.
63565,L352403,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,Had enough?
63566,L352396,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,"Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out."
63567,L352395,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!"
63568,L352394,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
63569,L352393,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!"
63570,L352392,u1856,m122,FRANCIS,You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
63571,L352802,u1857,m122,HOLLY,Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
63572,L352801,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him..."
63573,L352800,u1857,m122,HOLLY,"That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!"
63574,L352799,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
63575,L352798,u1857,m122,HOLLY,"He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran."
63576,L352797,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!"
63577,L352796,u1857,m122,HOLLY,It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
63578,L352664,u1861,m122,MARY,I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
63579,L352663,u1858,m122,JESSICA,When do you go up?
63580,L352662,u1861,m122,MARY,I'm very smart.
63581,L352661,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Why aren't you in Nursery?
63582,L352660,u1861,m122,MARY,Here.
63583,L352659,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Where do you live, Mary?"
63584,L352658,u1861,m122,MARY,I'm Mary 2.
63585,L352657,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What's your name?
63586,L353082,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
63587,L353081,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Is it inside the city?
63588,L353080,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
63589,L353079,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What does that water do?
63590,L353078,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Beloved wife...
63591,L353077,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Beloved husband...
63592,L353076,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either..."
63593,L353075,u1858,m122,JESSICA,And Sanctuary?
63594,L353074,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Yes. You and I, Jessica."
63595,L353073,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"""Beloved son""...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?"
63596,L353051,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want."
63597,L353050,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
63598,L353049,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!"
63599,L353048,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Things change!
63600,L353047,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!"
63601,L353046,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
63602,L353045,u1858,m122,JESSICA,You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
63603,L353044,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
63604,L353043,u1858,m122,JESSICA,To what?
63605,L353042,u1859,m122,LOGAN,We can't. We're going back.
63606,L353041,u1858,m122,JESSICA,He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
63607,L353040,u1859,m122,LOGAN,What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
63608,L353012,u1858,m122,JESSICA,You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
63609,L353011,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes ""real"". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope."
63610,L353010,u1858,m122,JESSICA,There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
63611,L353009,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You want there to be one... that doesn't...
63612,L353008,u1858,m122,JESSICA,There's a Sanctuary... there is!
63613,L353004,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"One in a million, I suppose"
63614,L353003,u1858,m122,JESSICA,He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
63615,L353002,u1859,m122,LOGAN,That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
63616,L352939,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It could be...
63617,L352938,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
63618,L352934,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"""Beloved Husband"". ""Beloved Wife"". What can all that mean?"
63619,L352933,u1859,m122,LOGAN,They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
63620,L352930,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?"
63621,L352929,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
63622,L352928,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Then the answer's yes...
63623,L352927,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Of course.
63624,L352926,u1858,m122,JESSICA,...But I still have the choice...?
63625,L352925,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"You know, Jessica."
63626,L352924,u1858,m122,JESSICA,You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
63627,L352923,u1859,m122,LOGAN,The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
63628,L352922,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What does it mean?
63629,L352920,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?"
63630,L352919,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
63631,L352918,u1859,m122,LOGAN,How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
63632,L352917,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside."
63633,L352916,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Do you think he was telling the Truth?
63634,L352915,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It all seemed to make sense until Box.
63635,L352914,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I won't.
63636,L352913,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Don't ever let go.
63637,L352912,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I doubt it.
63638,L352911,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
63639,L352909,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
63640,L352908,u1858,m122,JESSICA,It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
63641,L352906,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Sooner or later, we'll have to try something."
63642,L352905,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Don't!
63643,L352904,u1859,m122,LOGAN,We'll be all right...  We will...
63644,L352903,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I hate outside! I hate it!
63645,L352901,u1858,m122,JESSICA,And yours.
63646,L352900,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
63647,L352899,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What's that?
63648,L352841,u1858,m122,JESSICA,For us.
63649,L352840,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
63650,L352839,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you."
63651,L352838,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
63652,L352837,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
63653,L352836,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?"
63654,L352835,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"You're really one of us now, aren't you?"
63655,L352834,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It doesn't make any difference anymore.
63656,L352833,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
63657,L352831,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back."
63658,L352830,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I'm afraid.
63659,L352826,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
63660,L352825,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course."
63661,L352824,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What do you suppose this was...?
63662,L352823,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It's the only way.
63663,L352822,u1858,m122,JESSICA,How do we know this is the right way?
63664,L352815,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Why, Jessica? You're still a green."
63665,L352814,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Will you take me with you?
63666,L352783,u1858,m122,JESSICA,They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
63667,L352782,u1859,m122,LOGAN,How will they know we're coming?
63668,L352781,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me."
63669,L352779,u1858,m122,JESSICA,We'll convince them.
63670,L352778,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,"
63671,L352777,u1858,m122,JESSICA,They won't listen.
63672,L352776,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
63673,L352775,u1858,m122,JESSICA,They won't believe us.
63674,L352774,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
63675,L352773,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"He's good, isn't he?"
63676,L352772,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
63677,L352771,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
63678,L352770,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Are you taking me to them?
63679,L352706,u1858,m122,JESSICA,No. Not that either.
63680,L352705,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
63681,L352704,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I -- I can't.
63682,L352703,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them."
63683,L352702,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now..."
63684,L352701,u1859,m122,LOGAN,All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
63685,L352700,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you."
63686,L352699,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
63687,L352698,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
63688,L352654,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Muscle? I don't know that one.
63689,L352653,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast"
63690,L352652,u1858,m122,JESSICA,But what is this -- why?
63691,L352651,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
63692,L352646,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Let's see -- how long has it been?
63693,L352645,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?"
63694,L352644,u1859,m122,LOGAN,When did you begin to question Lastday?
63695,L352643,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I have.
63696,L352642,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Uh-uh.
63697,L352641,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
63698,L352640,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
63699,L352639,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Some people say children need human mothering.
63700,L352638,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
63701,L352637,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
63702,L352636,u1859,m122,LOGAN,They're like beasts. Wild.
63703,L352634,u1859,m122,LOGAN,That's nice.
63704,L352633,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I'd rather be with you.
63705,L352632,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
63706,L352631,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"You're not going, are you?"
63707,L352630,u1859,m122,LOGAN,A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
63708,L352627,u1858,m122,JESSICA,We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
63709,L352626,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"If you trusted me, you'd know."
63710,L352625,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Of course --
63711,L352624,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"If you did know, you'd tell me."
63712,L352623,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I wish I knew what you think I know.
63713,L352622,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Maybe you'll think of something...
63714,L352621,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I wish I could help you.
63715,L352620,u1859,m122,LOGAN,That's tomorrow.
63716,L352619,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What're you going to do?
63717,L352618,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What do you need?
63718,L352617,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Are you here to help me?
63719,L352594,u1859,m122,LOGAN,And I never heard of Sanctuary.
63720,L352593,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
63721,L352592,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I don't have much time.
63722,L352591,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Please? What friends?
63723,L352590,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please..."
63724,L352589,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I don't..
63725,L352588,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I let him go... believe me.
63726,L352587,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"And then you killed him, right?"
63727,L352586,u1859,m122,LOGAN,A Runner gave it to me.
63728,L352585,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Where did you get that?
63729,L352584,u1858,m122,JESSICA,How can I?
63730,L352583,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It's different now. Help me.
63731,L352582,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
63732,L352581,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Both... running's what I'm interested in.
63733,L352580,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"About running, dying what?"
63734,L352579,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You know something.
63735,L352578,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Why tell me?
63736,L352577,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'm going to run.
63737,L352576,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Why show me?
63738,L352575,u1859,m122,LOGAN,All right.
63739,L352574,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I don't believe you. There has to be more.
63740,L352573,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You know.
63741,L352572,u1858,m122,JESSICA,You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
63742,L352571,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Then it's still no.
63743,L352570,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Of course.
63744,L352569,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Thanks... but I have the choice.
63745,L352568,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Maybe... sure...
63746,L352567,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?"
63747,L352566,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I couldn't get you out of my mind.
63748,L352565,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Here I am.  Shall I come in?
63749,L352564,u1859,m122,LOGAN,But I wasn't sure you'd come.
63750,L352563,u1858,m122,JESSICA,You could have called me yourself.
63751,L352510,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You're sure you don't want to try?
63752,L352509,u1858,m122,JESSICA,K.
63753,L352508,u1859,m122,LOGAN,What Quad do you live in?
63754,L352507,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?"
63755,L352506,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Six. I go red next year.
63756,L352505,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Are you a 5 or a 6?
63757,L352504,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I didn't say that I would run... I just...
63758,L352503,u1859,m122,LOGAN,But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
63759,L352501,u1859,m122,LOGAN,So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
63760,L352500,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I suppose. But what if you want to live?
63761,L352499,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
63762,L352498,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Why is it wrong to run?
63763,L352497,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'm not armed.  Well?
63764,L352496,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I'm afraid to tell you.
63765,L352495,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'm listening.
63766,L352494,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Not about that.
63767,L352493,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
63768,L352492,u1858,m122,JESSICA,How a Sandman lives.
63769,L352491,u1859,m122,LOGAN,About what?
63770,L352490,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Curious.
63771,L352489,u1859,m122,LOGAN,And now?
63772,L352488,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I changed my mind.
63773,L352487,u1859,m122,LOGAN,And?
63774,L352486,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I thought I had to do something.
63775,L352485,u1859,m122,LOGAN,But you put yourself on the circuit!
63776,L352484,u1858,m122,JESSICA,No.

63780,L352480,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Jessica.
63781,L352479,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You felt sad. What's your name?
63782,L352478,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
63783,L352477,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
63784,L352476,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
63785,L352475,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Killed? Why do you use that word?
63786,L352474,u1858,m122,JESSICA,He was killed.
63787,L352473,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Yes... probably he was renewed?
63788,L352472,u1858,m122,JESSICA,A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
63789,L352471,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Sad? What made you sad?
63790,L352470,u1858,m122,JESSICA,"Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake."
63791,L352469,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Well then...?
63792,L352468,u1858,m122,JESSICA,No.
63793,L352467,u1859,m122,LOGAN,You prefer women?
63794,L352466,u1858,m122,JESSICA,No.  Just no.
63795,L352465,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Please... no?  You mean ""not here"" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you."
63796,L352464,u1858,m122,JESSICA,Please... No.
63797,L352463,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"What's wrong, Available?"
63798,L353090,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"Oh, my..."

63802,L353039,u1858,m122,JESSICA,We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
63803,L353038,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
63804,L353033,u1858,m122,JESSICA,At least it's over...
63805,L353032,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,I'll make the arrangements.
63806,L353031,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
63807,L353030,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What's that?
63808,L353029,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,We'll have to bury him.
63809,L352999,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,I don't know... but it does.
63810,L352998,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What people?
63811,L352997,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,All this. All of it.
63812,L352996,u1858,m122,JESSICA,What belongs to the people?
63813,L352989,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"""Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."""
63814,L352988,u1858,m122,JESSICA,No.
63815,L352987,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
63816,L352986,u1858,m122,JESSICA,I don't know.
63817,L352985,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,What kind of jewel is this?
63818,L352973,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Mother and Father said so... you know?

63820,L352971,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Yes...
63821,L352970,u1858,m122,JESSICA,And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
63822,L352954,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  ""The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.""  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?"
63823,L352953,u1858,m122,JESSICA,But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
63824,L352952,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too."
63825,L352720,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"No -- Look, I'm in a hurry."
63826,L352719,u1863,m122,RECEPTIONIST,My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
63827,L352718,u1859,m122,LOGAN,It's all right with me. Is he here?
63828,L352717,u1863,m122,RECEPTIONIST,I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
63829,L352716,u1859,m122,LOGAN,A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
63830,L352715,u1863,m122,RECEPTIONIST,We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
63831,L352714,u1863,m122,RECEPTIONIST,Do you want to see Doc?
63832,L352713,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Hello.

63839,L353083,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
63840,L353072,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"Oh, yes... I think..."
63841,L353071,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Stay? They lived together all their years?
63842,L353070,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. ""Beloved"" is a word they used -- to stay together."
63843,L353069,u1859,m122,LOGAN,"Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? ""Beloved husband""... ""Beloved son""... ""Beloved wife""..."
63844,L353068,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,That's better than gold when it's cold.
63845,L353066,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
63846,L353065,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
63847,L353061,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,And all alive you say?
63848,L353060,u1859,m122,LOGAN,More... many more.
63849,L353059,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
63850,L353058,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Alive?
63851,L353057,u1859,m122,LOGAN,To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
63852,L353054,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
63853,L353053,u1859,m122,LOGAN,We're leaving.
63854,L353036,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,All right.

63856,L353034,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Are you ready to put him in?
63857,L352995,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
63858,L352994,u1859,m122,LOGAN,May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
63859,L352993,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"Never, never, ever. Nothing."
63860,L352992,u1859,m122,LOGAN,Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
63861,L352991,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"No, no, no"
63862,L352990,u1859,m122,LOGAN,What's beyond this place -- do you know?
63863,L352982,u1859,m122,LOGAN,I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
63864,L352981,u1862,m122,OLD MAN,"It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  ""Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."""

64142,L355989,u1873,m123,CLAIRE,I wouldn't know how.
64143,L356350,u1873,m123,CLAIRE,He won't give his name.
64144,L356349,u1883,m123,PETE,Who is it?
64145,L356250,u1883,m123,PETE,Who was the man?
64146,L356249,u1873,m123,CLAIRE,We know that.
64147,L356216,u1883,m123,PETE,Nothin'.
64148,L356215,u1873,m123,CLAIRE,What's the matter?
64149,L356041,u1883,m123,PETE,No... I don't. Why?
64150,L356040,u1873,m123,CLAIRE,Do you remember?
64151,L356022,u1873,m123,CLAIRE,Coming up.
64152,L356021,u1883,m123,PETE,No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
64153,L355952,u1874,m123,DR. ROGOFF,"I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system."
64154,L355951,u1888,m123,WARDEN,A headache?
64155,L355950,u1874,m123,DR. ROGOFF,"I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache."
64156,L355949,u1874,m123,DR. ROGOFF,Not even close.
64157,L355948,u1888,m123,WARDEN,He's not Madison?
64158,L355947,u1874,m123,DR. ROGOFF,"He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough."
64159,L355946,u1888,m123,WARDEN,Who is this man?
64160,L355945,u1874,m123,DR. ROGOFF,I don't know yet.
64161,L355944,u1888,m123,WARDEN,"What is this, Rogoff?"
64162,L356143,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"FUCKIN' ""A""."
64163,L356142,u1875,m123,DRIVER,I'll get a manual.  and study it.
64164,L356141,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL."
64165,L356140,u1875,m123,DRIVER,No.
64166,L356139,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
64167,L356138,u1875,m123,DRIVER,I won't ever tailgate.
64168,L356135,u1875,m123,DRIVER,I... I didn't say anything...
64169,L356134,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,WHAT DID YOU SAY?
64170,L355810,u1877,m123,FRED,The first night... Not the last two.
64171,L355809,u1876,m123,ED,Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
64172,L355767,u1876,m123,ED,Tone deaf.
64173,L355766,u1877,m123,FRED,Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
64174,L355765,u1876,m123,ED,What's your axe?
64175,L355762,u1877,m123,FRED,"No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed."
64176,L355761,u1876,m123,ED,There's no other bedroom?
64177,L355750,u1876,m123,ED,Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
64178,L355749,u1877,m123,FRED,That's it.
64179,L355919,u1877,m123,FRED,But my head...
64180,L355918,u1878,m123,GUARD,The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
64181,L355917,u1877,m123,FRED,Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
64182,L355916,u1878,m123,GUARD,What is it?
64183,L355912,u1878,m123,GUARD,I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
64184,L355911,u1877,m123,FRED,The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
64185,L355910,u1878,m123,GUARD,"What's bothering you, Madison?"
64186,L355909,u1877,m123,FRED,"No, no. I want to go in."
64187,L355908,u1878,m123,GUARD,"Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it."
64188,L355907,u1877,m123,FRED,My... My head.
64189,L355906,u1878,m123,GUARD,Something wrong?
64190,L356409,u1882,m123,MYSTERY MAN,Alice who?
64191,L356408,u1877,m123,FRED,Where's Alice?
64192,L355824,u1877,m123,FRED,That's absurd.
64193,L355823,u1882,m123,MYSTERY MAN,At your house.
64194,L355822,u1877,m123,FRED,What do you mean? You're where right now?
64195,L355821,u1882,m123,MYSTERY MAN,"Of course. In fact, I'm there right now."
64196,L355820,u1877,m123,FRED,"No, no I don't. Are you sure?"
64197,L355819,u1882,m123,MYSTERY MAN,At your house. Don't you remember?
64198,L355818,u1877,m123,FRED,I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
64199,L355817,u1882,m123,MYSTERY MAN,"We've met before, haven't we?"
64200,L355860,u1877,m123,FRED,No... of course not.
64201,L355859,u1885,m123,RENEE,Was there?
64202,L355858,u1877,m123,FRED,I thought there might be somebody inside.
64203,L355857,u1885,m123,RENEE,Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
64204,L355856,u1877,m123,FRED,I told you to stay in the car!
64205,L355854,u1877,m123,FRED,He's got some fucked up friends.
64206,L355853,u1885,m123,RENEE,"I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay..."
64207,L355852,u1877,m123,FRED,What job?
64208,L355851,u1885,m123,RENEE,It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
64209,L355849,u1877,m123,FRED,Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
64210,L355848,u1885,m123,RENEE,But...
64211,L355847,u1877,m123,FRED,Let's go home.
64212,L355837,u1877,m123,FRED,Just a minute.
64213,L355836,u1885,m123,RENEE,I thought you were getting me a drink?
64214,L355815,u1885,m123,RENEE,But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
64215,L355814,u1877,m123,FRED,I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
64216,L355808,u1885,m123,RENEE,I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
64217,L355807,u1877,m123,FRED,Where would you feel safe?
64218,L355799,u1885,m123,RENEE,Why would anyone do something like this?
64219,L355798,u1877,m123,FRED,"No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember."
64220,L355794,u1885,m123,RENEE,On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
64221,L355793,u1877,m123,FRED,What?
64222,L355792,u1885,m123,RENEE,What was that?!!!
64223,L355791,u1877,m123,FRED,I wish I knew.
64224,L355790,u1885,m123,RENEE,What the hell is going on?!
64225,L355787,u1877,m123,FRED,"Thanks, guys."
64226,L355786,u1885,m123,RENEE,We will.
64227,L355748,u1885,m123,RENEE,Two detectives are coming out.
64228,L355747,u1877,m123,FRED,So?
64229,L355744,u1877,m123,FRED,All right.
64230,L355743,u1885,m123,RENEE,We've got to call the police.
64231,L355740,u1885,m123,RENEE,I guess so.
64232,L355739,u1877,m123,FRED,Don't you want to watch it?
64233,L355738,u1885,m123,RENEE,"Yes, I just found it on the step."
64234,L355737,u1877,m123,FRED,What's that? Another tape?
64235,L355736,u1877,m123,FRED,Who the hell owns that dog?
64236,L355735,u1885,m123,RENEE,"That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up."
64237,L355734,u1877,m123,FRED,You're up early.
64238,L355730,u1877,m123,FRED,You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
64239,L355729,u1885,m123,RENEE,Yeah?
64240,L355728,u1877,m123,FRED,I had a dream about you last night...
64241,L355726,u1877,m123,FRED,"You were asleep when I got home, yes."
64242,L355725,u1885,m123,RENEE,"I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?"
64243,L355724,u1877,m123,FRED,From the club. You didn't answer.
64244,L355723,u1885,m123,RENEE,Called? When?
64245,L355722,u1877,m123,FRED,"I called, you know."
64246,L355721,u1885,m123,RENEE,"Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one."
64247,L355720,u1877,m123,FRED,When you didn't come to the club.
64248,L355719,u1885,m123,RENEE,What night?
64249,L355718,u1877,m123,FRED,Same one you were reading the other night?
64250,L355717,u1885,m123,RENEE,"Huh?... oh, yeah, it is."
64251,L355716,u1877,m123,FRED,"Good book, huh?"
64252,L355715,u1877,m123,FRED,Maybe.
64253,L355714,u1885,m123,RENEE,It must be from a real estate agent.
64254,L355711,u1885,m123,RENEE,"No, nothing."
64255,L355710,u1877,m123,FRED,Does it say anything on the tape?
64256,L355709,u1885,m123,RENEE,"I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it."
64257,L355708,u1877,m123,FRED,Who's it from?
64258,L355707,u1885,m123,RENEE,A videotape.
64259,L355706,u1877,m123,FRED,What's that?
64260,L355705,u1885,m123,RENEE,Wake me up when you get home.
64261,L355704,u1877,m123,FRED,That's why I married you.
64262,L355703,u1885,m123,RENEE,"I like to laugh, Fred."
64263,L355702,u1877,m123,FRED,It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
64264,L355700,u1885,m123,RENEE,I thought I'd stay home and read.
64265,L355699,u1877,m123,FRED,What are you going to do?
64266,L355698,u1885,m123,RENEE,You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
64267,L355891,u1884,m123,RAQUEL,"I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian."
64268,L355890,u1880,m123,MARIAN,"The heart, I guess."
64269,L355889,u1884,m123,RAQUEL,Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
64270,L355888,u1880,m123,MARIAN,"Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely."
64271,L355887,u1884,m123,RAQUEL,Which would you choose?
64272,L355886,u1880,m123,MARIAN,Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
64273,L355885,u1884,m123,RAQUEL,They're gonna cook him.
64274,L355884,u1880,m123,MARIAN,How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
64275,L355883,u1884,m123,RAQUEL,Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
64276,L356363,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine."
64277,L356362,u1883,m123,PETE,Yeah.
64278,L356361,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
64279,L356360,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete."
64280,L356359,u1883,m123,PETE,"Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ..."
64281,L356358,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete."
64282,L356357,u1883,m123,PETE,Okay.
64283,L356356,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?"
64284,L356355,u1883,m123,PETE,Mr. Eddy?
64285,L356354,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,You know who it is.
64286,L356353,u1883,m123,PETE,Who is this?
64287,L356352,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?"
64288,L356351,u1883,m123,PETE,Hello.
64289,L356263,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
64290,L356262,u1883,m123,PETE,What?
64291,L356261,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?..."
64292,L356260,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
64293,L356259,u1883,m123,PETE,Okay.
64294,L356258,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"How ya doin', Pete?"
64295,L356169,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"You're my man, Pete."
64296,L356168,u1883,m123,PETE,It'll be ready.
64297,L356167,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today."
64298,L356166,u1883,m123,PETE,"Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?"
64299,L356165,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?"
64300,L356160,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,You will.
64301,L356159,u1883,m123,PETE,"Okay... Well, I'll see ya then."
64302,L356158,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"Suit yourself, champ."
64303,L356157,u1883,m123,PETE,"No thanks, Mr. Eddy."
64304,L356156,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,Yeah. Give ya a boner.
64305,L356155,u1883,m123,PETE,Pornos?
64306,L356154,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,You like pornos?
64307,L356153,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the ""Caddy"" by tomorrow."
64308,L356152,u1883,m123,PETE,"Thanks, Mr. Eddy."
64309,L356150,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,What'd I tell ya.
64310,L356149,u1883,m123,PETE,Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
64311,L356148,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,At sixty?
64312,L356147,u1883,m123,PETE,"Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet."
64313,L356146,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
64314,L356145,u1883,m123,PETE,I can see that.
64315,L356144,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate."
64316,L356130,u1883,m123,PETE,"Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy."
64317,L356129,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
64318,L356128,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,All right!
64319,L356127,u1883,m123,PETE,Give that a try.
64320,L356123,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go."
64321,L356122,u1883,m123,PETE,Okay... Lemme clear it with...
64322,L356121,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
64323,L356120,u1883,m123,PETE,"Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?"
64324,L356119,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!"
64325,L356118,u1883,m123,PETE,"No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy."
64326,L356117,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,"Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that."
64327,L356116,u1883,m123,PETE,"No, it's nothin'... I'm all right."
64328,L356115,u1881,m123,MR. EDDY,What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
64329,L356372,u1887,m123,VOICE,"Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you."
64330,L356371,u1883,m123,PETE,What's goin' on?
64331,L356369,u1883,m123,PETE,What?
64332,L356368,u1887,m123,VOICE,We just killed a couple of people...
64333,L356367,u1883,m123,PETE,"No. No, I don't."
64334,L356366,u1887,m123,VOICE,At your house. Don't you remember?
64335,L356365,u1883,m123,PETE,I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
64336,L356341,u1886,m123,SHEILA,FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
64337,L356340,u1883,m123,PETE,Sheila... Stop...
64338,L356337,u1883,m123,PETE,"Go home, Sheila."
64339,L356336,u1886,m123,SHEILA,YOU'RE SORRY!!
64340,L356335,u1883,m123,PETE,Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
64341,L356334,u1886,m123,SHEILA,What's the BITCH'S name?!
64342,L356333,u1883,m123,PETE,Hey... Sheila.
64343,L356332,u1886,m123,SHEILA,You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
64344,L356331,u1883,m123,PETE,Sheila...
64345,L356330,u1886,m123,SHEILA,You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
64346,L356329,u1883,m123,PETE,"Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?"
64347,L356229,u1883,m123,PETE,Come on.
64348,L356228,u1886,m123,SHEILA,I didn't know you cared.
64349,L356227,u1883,m123,PETE,Yeah.
64350,L356226,u1886,m123,SHEILA,I was?
64351,L356225,u1883,m123,PETE,"I've been here. You were lookin, right at me."
64352,L356224,u1886,m123,SHEILA,Where'd you come from?
64353,L356176,u1883,m123,PETE,"I do like you, Sheila."
64354,L356175,u1886,m123,SHEILA,Why don't you like me?
64355,L356173,u1883,m123,PETE,Come on... get in.
64356,L356172,u1886,m123,SHEILA,I don't know.
64357,L356171,u1883,m123,PETE,Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
64358,L356170,u1886,m123,SHEILA,What do you want?
64359,L356106,u1886,m123,SHEILA,No... I really don't want to talk about it.
64360,L356105,u1883,m123,PETE,Sheila?!
64361,L356104,u1886,m123,SHEILA,I don't want to talk about it...
64362,L356103,u1883,m123,PETE,"Whatiya mean, Sheila?"
64363,L356102,u1886,m123,SHEILA,It was weird...
64364,L356101,u1883,m123,PETE,No... I told you.
64365,L356100,u1886,m123,SHEILA,You really don't remember?
64366,L356099,u1883,m123,PETE,What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
64367,L356098,u1883,m123,PETE,Sure. Sure I do.
64368,L356097,u1886,m123,SHEILA,You still care about me?
64369,L356094,u1886,m123,SHEILA,You were acting like a different person.
64370,L356093,u1883,m123,PETE,Whatiya mean?
64371,L356092,u1886,m123,SHEILA,You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
64372,L356091,u1883,m123,PETE,I don't remember... What happened that night?
64373,L356090,u1886,m123,SHEILA,Last time I saw you.
64374,L356089,u1883,m123,PETE,What night?
64375,L356088,u1886,m123,SHEILA,What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
64376,L356087,u1883,m123,PETE,I don't know.
64377,L356086,u1886,m123,SHEILA,What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
64378,L356085,u1883,m123,PETE,Sorry... I...
64379,L356084,u1886,m123,SHEILA,Why haven't you called me?
64380,L356080,u1883,m123,PETE,Sure.
64381,L356079,u1886,m123,SHEILA,You want some company?
64382,L356078,u1883,m123,PETE,"Guess we're goin' over to the ""Ten Pin""."
64383,L356077,u1886,m123,SHEILA,What are you guys doin'?
64384,L356074,u1886,m123,SHEILA,Yeah.
64385,L356073,u1883,m123,PETE,Yeah?...
64386,L356072,u1886,m123,SHEILA,I missed you.
64387,L357776,u1889,m124,ASSISTANT SECRETARY,"Let me have it.  ""Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."""
64388,L357775,u1892,m124,CLERK,Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
64389,L357774,u1889,m124,ASSISTANT SECRETARY,I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
64390,L357773,u1892,m124,CLERK,"Yes, sir."
64391,L357772,u1889,m124,ASSISTANT SECRETARY,Yes. Might as well - all of it.
64392,L357771,u1892,m124,CLERK,All of it?
64393,L357768,u1892,m124,CLERK,"""Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."""
64394,L357767,u1889,m124,ASSISTANT SECRETARY,"Oh, read it!"
64395,L357766,u1892,m124,CLERK,Cable from Gainsford.
64396,L357226,u1891,m124,CHANG,Yes.
64397,L357225,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Two years!?
64398,L357218,u1891,m124,CHANG,Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
64399,L357217,u1890,m124,BARNARD,What about those men we met this morning?
64400,L357208,u1891,m124,CHANG,"It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible."
64401,L357207,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Not even a radio?
64402,L357201,u1891,m124,CHANG,Thank you.
64403,L357200,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!"
64404,L357199,u1891,m124,CHANG,She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
64405,L357198,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
64406,L357661,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
64407,L357660,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?"
64408,L357527,u1890,m124,BARNARD,In a quandary.
64409,L357526,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?"
64410,L357525,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Come on, Lovey."
64411,L357524,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"They were in a quandary, and"
64412,L357523,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!"
64413,L357522,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, ""Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed."" And then the mama bear said, ""Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" And then the big papa bear, he roared, ""And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!"
64414,L357520,u1898,m124,LOVETT,This doesn't obligate me in any way.
64415,L357519,u1890,m124,BARNARD,There you are!
64416,L357516,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Certainly not!
64417,L357515,u1898,m124,LOVETT,And be poisoned out here in the open?
64418,L357514,u1890,m124,BARNARD,You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
64419,L357513,u1898,m124,LOVETT,So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
64420,L357512,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down."
64421,L357506,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Horns? What kind of horns?
64422,L357505,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Yeah. You know.
64423,L357504,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Horns?
64424,L357503,u1890,m124,BARNARD,They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
64425,L357502,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!"
64426,L357501,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Okay, Lovey."
64427,L357500,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!"
64428,L357499,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Just call me Barney.
64429,L357498,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be."
64430,L357408,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Sounds like a stall to me.
64431,L357407,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Yes.
64432,L357377,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back."
64433,L357376,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had."
64434,L357375,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people"
64435,L357374,u1890,m124,BARNARD,That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
64436,L357368,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
64437,L357367,u1898,m124,LOVETT,The police?
64438,L357366,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year."
64439,L357365,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Certainly not.
64440,L357362,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!"
64441,L357361,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Have I?
64442,L357360,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you."
64443,L357359,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask."
64444,L357241,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots."
64445,L357240,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Yes.
64446,L357239,u1890,m124,BARNARD,No kidding?
64447,L357238,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire."
64448,L357237,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
64449,L357236,u1898,m124,LOVETT,I'm thinking.
64450,L357235,u1890,m124,BARNARD,How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
64451,L357179,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious."
64452,L357178,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
64453,L357177,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me."
64454,L357176,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
64455,L357174,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Please don't call me Lovey.
64456,L357173,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey."
64457,L357172,u1898,m124,LOVETT,That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
64458,L357171,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it."
64459,L357170,u1898,m124,LOVETT,I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
64460,L357169,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Something tells me this means food. Come on!
64461,L357168,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey."
64462,L357167,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
64463,L357166,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Will you stop squawking!
64464,L357165,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place."
64465,L357143,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Do you think they're cannibals?
64466,L357142,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Yes!
64467,L357141,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Where are they? Do you see them?
64468,L357124,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"All right, all right. Keep quiet."
64469,L357123,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
64470,L357042,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
64471,L357041,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
64472,L357028,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
64473,L357027,u1890,m124,BARNARD,He might have lost his way.
64474,L357021,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Now you're irritating and absurd!
64475,L357020,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it."
64476,L357019,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!"
64477,L357018,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Yes.
64478,L357017,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Oh, really?"
64479,L357016,u1890,m124,BARNARD,I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
64480,L357015,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south"
64481,L357014,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Look here
64482,L357013,u1898,m124,LOVETT,It certainly is.
64483,L357012,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Is it?
64484,L357011,u1898,m124,LOVETT,That's ridiculous.
64485,L357010,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west."
64486,L357009,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Why, of course. Yes."
64487,L357008,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?"
64488,L357007,u1898,m124,LOVETT,I'm never conversational before I coffee.
64489,L357006,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Well, it's a good morning, anyway."
64490,L357005,u1898,m124,LOVETT,I see.
64491,L357004,u1890,m124,BARNARD,I see.
64492,L357003,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P."
64493,L357000,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Good morning
64494,L356999,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"I say, good morning, Lovey."
64495,L356998,u1898,m124,LOVETT,I beg your pardon.
64496,L356997,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Good morning, Lovey."
64497,L356970,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!"
64498,L356969,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Don't call me brother.
64499,L356968,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Okay, brother."
64500,L356967,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?"
64501,L356965,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era."
64502,L356964,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Yeah, I remember. You said that before."
64503,L356963,u1898,m124,LOVETT,It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
64504,L356962,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?"
64505,L356961,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton."
64506,L356960,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Uh-huh.
64507,L356959,u1898,m124,LOVETT,This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
64508,L356958,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Sorry.
64509,L356957,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Not at all.
64510,L356956,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
64511,L356955,u1898,m124,LOVETT,When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
64512,L356954,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Uh-huh.
64513,L356953,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Found in Asia!
64514,L356952,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Well, what do you know about that!"
64515,L356951,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia."
64516,L356950,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Oh, I see."
64517,L356949,u1898,m124,LOVETT,A paleontologist.
64518,L356948,u1890,m124,BARNARD,A what?
64519,L356947,u1898,m124,LOVETT,I'm a paleontologist.
64520,L356946,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Fossils, huh?"
64521,L356945,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Fossils.
64522,L356944,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?"
64523,L357590,u1893,m124,CONWAY,All right.
64524,L357589,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels."
64525,L357588,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Gold. You were going to
64526,L357587,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Huh?
64527,L357586,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Say, what about that gold deal?"
64528,L357585,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Think of it! In times like these.
64529,L357584,u1893,m124,CONWAY,It's unbelievable.
64530,L357583,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?"
64531,L357404,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?"
64532,L357403,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
64533,L357370,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
64534,L357369,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Chalmers Bryant!
64535,L357364,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?"
64536,L357363,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]"
64537,L357351,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
64538,L357350,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!"
64539,L357234,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary."
64540,L357233,u1890,m124,BARNARD,That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
64541,L357181,u1890,m124,BARNARD,I'll say.
64542,L357180,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?"
64543,L357115,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning."
64544,L357114,u1890,m124,BARNARD,What are we going to do?
64545,L357040,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
64546,L357039,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, that's that, I guess."
64547,L357038,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
64548,L357037,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Charming chap.
64549,L357645,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
64550,L357644,u1895,m124,GLORIA,If you want me to!
64551,L357631,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay."
64552,L357630,u1895,m124,GLORIA,Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
64553,L357629,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here."
64554,L357356,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Why, you look beautiful."
64555,L357355,u1895,m124,GLORIA,Nothing. Why?
64556,L357354,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Hey, what's happened to you?"
64557,L356975,u1895,m124,GLORIA,"Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!"
64558,L356974,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Say, you're an American, aren't you?"
64559,L356973,u1895,m124,GLORIA,No.
64560,L356972,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"I say, will you have a cigarette?"
64561,L357643,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?"
64562,L357642,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?"
64563,L357641,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business"
64564,L357640,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?"
64565,L357639,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Well - I'm
64566,L357638,u1894,m124,GEORGE,You mean you don't want to go?
64567,L357637,u1890,m124,BARNARD,I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
64568,L357636,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
64569,L357635,u1890,m124,BARNARD,When are you going to start?
64570,L357634,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!"
64571,L357633,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Leaving?
64572,L357632,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving."
64573,L357140,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Look, Bob!"
64574,L357139,u1890,m124,BARNARD,Hey - look!
64575,L357138,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Over by that hill.
64576,L357137,u1890,m124,BARNARD,"Cave, eh? Where?"
64577,L357619,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
64578,L357618,u1891,m124,CHANG,You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
64579,L357613,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds."
64580,L357612,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?"
64581,L357611,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age."
64582,L357610,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?"
64583,L357609,u1891,m124,CHANG,Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
64584,L357608,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Suppose she should leave it?
64585,L357607,u1891,m124,CHANG,Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
64586,L357606,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
64587,L357605,u1891,m124,CHANG,Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
64588,L357604,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
64589,L357603,u1891,m124,CHANG,Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
64590,L357602,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Yes, charming."
64591,L357601,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Charming, isn't she?"
64592,L357598,u1893,m124,CONWAY,No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
64593,L357597,u1891,m124,CHANG,Shall we have another?
64594,L357596,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Yes. I'm afraid it does.
64595,L357413,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?"
64596,L357412,u1891,m124,CHANG,"The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway."
64597,L357411,u1893,m124,CONWAY,And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
64598,L357410,u1891,m124,CHANG,The only one.
64599,L357409,u1893,m124,CONWAY,One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
64600,L357332,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?"
64601,L357331,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course."
64602,L357330,u1891,m124,CHANG,"I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?"
64603,L357329,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I surprise you? Now that's news.
64604,L357328,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!"
64605,L357327,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course."
64606,L357326,u1891,m124,CHANG,"And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide."
64607,L357325,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Very often.
64608,L357324,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, ""He worried himself to death?"" or, ""This thing or that killed him?"""
64609,L357323,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all."
64610,L357322,u1891,m124,CHANG,You're startled?
64611,L357321,u1893,m124,CONWAY,108 and still active?
64612,L357320,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?"
64613,L357319,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, is it?"
64614,L357318,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here."
64615,L357317,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, they didn't actually mean that."
64616,L357316,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation."
64617,L357315,u1893,m124,CONWAY,He amputated his own leg?
64618,L357314,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself."
64619,L357313,u1893,m124,CONWAY,When was all this?
64620,L357312,u1891,m124,CHANG,"A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault."
64621,L357311,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Who?
64622,L357310,u1891,m124,CHANG,"That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man."
64623,L357309,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?"
64624,L357308,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange ."
64625,L357307,u1893,m124,CONWAY,buy and sell?
64626,L357306,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . ."
64627,L357305,u1893,m124,CONWAY,That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
64628,L357304,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it."
64629,L357303,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
64630,L357302,u1891,m124,CHANG,Centuries.
64631,L357301,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, it must have taken"
64632,L357300,u1891,m124,CHANG,They were.
64633,L357299,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?"
64634,L357296,u1891,m124,CHANG,"You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems."
64635,L357295,u1893,m124,CONWAY,That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
64636,L357294,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her."
64637,L357293,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
64638,L357292,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted."
64639,L357291,u1893,m124,CONWAY,You have no disputes over women?
64640,L357290,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything."
64641,L357289,u1893,m124,CONWAY,How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
64642,L357288,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Oh, good heavens, no!"
64643,L357287,u1893,m124,CONWAY,How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
64644,L357286,u1891,m124,CHANG,"We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy."
64645,L357285,u1893,m124,CONWAY,That's intelligent.
64646,L357284,u1891,m124,CHANG,"To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself."
64647,L357283,u1891,m124,CHANG,We follow many.
64648,L357282,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"By the way, what religion do you follow here?"
64649,L357275,u1891,m124,CHANG,Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
64650,L357274,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it."
64651,L357273,u1891,m124,CHANG,"There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss."
64652,L357272,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be."
64653,L357271,u1891,m124,CHANG,In time you will meet them all.
64654,L357270,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Who, for instance?"
64655,L357269,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Oh, yes."
64656,L357268,u1893,m124,CONWAY,So there are others?
64657,L357267,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Goodness, no!"
64658,L357266,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
64659,L357265,u1891,m124,CHANG,"It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La."
64660,L357203,u1891,m124,CHANG,I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
64661,L357202,u1893,m124,CONWAY,And the wine - excellent.
64662,L357160,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Thank you.
64663,L357159,u1891,m124,CHANG,"You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult."
64664,L357154,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead."
64665,L357153,u1891,m124,CHANG,Where is your mad pilot?
64666,L357150,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction"
64667,L357149,u1891,m124,CHANG,How do you do?
64668,L357148,u1893,m124,CONWAY,And mine's Conway.
64669,L357193,u1895,m124,GLORIA,"Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!"
64670,L357192,u1891,m124,CHANG,You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
64671,L357191,u1895,m124,GLORIA,"Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!"
64672,L357190,u1891,m124,CHANG,Please let me help you.
64673,L357189,u1895,m124,GLORIA,No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
64674,L357188,u1891,m124,CHANG,"I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here."
64675,L357187,u1895,m124,GLORIA,I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
64676,L357186,u1891,m124,CHANG,Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
64677,L357185,u1895,m124,GLORIA,You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
64678,L357184,u1891,m124,CHANG,I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
64679,L357183,u1895,m124,GLORIA,What do you want?
64680,L357582,u1891,m124,CHANG,Thank you.
64681,L357581,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Oh, thank you. Thank you!"
64682,L357580,u1891,m124,CHANG,Then it's done.
64683,L357579,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Oh, immediately."
64684,L357578,u1891,m124,CHANG,I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
64685,L357577,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
64686,L357576,u1891,m124,CHANG,Splendid!
64687,L357575,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology."
64688,L357574,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Now, what would you like to do?"
64689,L357573,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"""Ungrateful fool . . . !""  Those were my very words to myself last night. ""Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."""
64690,L357572,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Why, no."
64691,L357571,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, ""Lovey""  Mr. Lovett! ""Mr. Lovett,"" I said, ""you are an ungrateful fool . . . """
64692,L357570,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Oh, I'm so glad."
64693,L357569,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story."
64694,L357568,u1891,m124,CHANG,You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
64695,L357567,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]"
64696,L357566,u1891,m124,CHANG,Yes.
64697,L357565,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy."
64698,L357402,u1898,m124,LOVETT,The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
64699,L357401,u1891,m124,CHANG,"You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway."
64700,L357224,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years."
64701,L357223,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"What exactly do you mean by ""almost any time now""?"
64702,L357216,u1891,m124,CHANG,No.
64703,L357215,u1898,m124,LOVETT,No porters here!!
64704,L357214,u1891,m124,CHANG,"I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here."
64705,L357213,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason."
64706,L357617,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!"
64707,L357616,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't"
64708,L357615,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!"
64709,L357406,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out."
64710,L357405,u1891,m124,CHANG,The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
64711,L357222,u1891,m124,CHANG,"In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now"
64712,L357221,u1894,m124,GEORGE,How can we get in touch with them?
64713,L357220,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey."
64714,L357212,u1891,m124,CHANG,"Oh, dear."
64715,L357211,u1894,m124,GEORGE,As far away as I ever want to be.
64716,L357210,u1891,m124,CHANG,Are you so certain you are away from it?
64717,L357209,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization."
64718,L357156,u1891,m124,CHANG,Pardon me
64719,L357155,u1894,m124,GEORGE,We were just going to bury him when you came along.
64720,L357761,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Hey!
64721,L357760,u1899,m124,MARIA,"No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!"
64722,L357743,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!"
64723,L357742,u1899,m124,MARIA,Are you taking me?
64724,L357734,u1899,m124,MARIA,"No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now."
64725,L357733,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You're lying, aren't you?"
64726,L357730,u1899,m124,MARIA,"I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?"
64727,L357729,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Yes.
64728,L357728,u1899,m124,MARIA,"Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?"
64729,L357727,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?"
64730,L357726,u1899,m124,MARIA,"He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!"
64731,L357725,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Father Perrault is dead.
64732,L357724,u1899,m124,MARIA,"The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!"
64733,L357723,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
64734,L357722,u1899,m124,MARIA,"I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!"
64735,L357721,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
64736,L357720,u1899,m124,MARIA,It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
64737,L357435,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth."
64738,L357434,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on."
64739,L357433,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on."
64740,L357432,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?"
64741,L357431,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all."
64742,L357430,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, the girl at the piano?"
64743,L357429,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,Sondra Bizet.
64744,L357428,u1893,m124,CONWAY,That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
64745,L357427,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here."
64746,L357425,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years."
64747,L357424,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!"
64748,L357423,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"What is it, my son?"
64749,L357422,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"It's astonishing - and incredible, but"
64750,L357421,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as"
64751,L357420,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival."
64752,L357419,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,Yes.
64753,L357418,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Are you the High Lama?
64754,L357417,u1896,m124,HIGH LAMA,"Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm."
64755,L357627,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Do you think this will come in my time?
64756,L357626,u1897,m124,LAMA,"I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without."
64757,L357624,u1897,m124,LAMA,"Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die."
64758,L357623,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Mine?
64759,L357622,u1897,m124,LAMA,"You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway."
64760,L357621,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
64761,L357620,u1897,m124,LAMA,"Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected."
64762,L357763,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child."
64763,L357762,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
64764,L357759,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on."
64765,L357758,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day."
64766,L357750,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
64767,L357749,u1894,m124,GEORGE,was saying
64768,L357748,u1893,m124,CONWAY,What was that?
64769,L357747,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone."
64770,L357741,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Come on! We're wasting time!
64771,L357740,u1894,m124,GEORGE,I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
64772,L357739,u1893,m124,CONWAY,What about the others?
64773,L357738,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Yes, everything!"
64774,L357737,u1893,m124,CONWAY,The clothes?
64775,L357736,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Yes.
64776,L357735,u1893,m124,CONWAY,You say the porters are waiting for us?
64777,L357732,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!"
64778,L357731,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob."
64779,L357714,u1894,m124,GEORGE,All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
64780,L357713,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
64781,L357712,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!"
64782,L357711,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place."
64783,L357710,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You're wrong, George."
64784,L357709,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!"
64785,L357708,u1893,m124,CONWAY,She came here in 1888!
64786,L357707,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"What do you mean - ""fade away like an echo""?"
64787,L357706,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
64788,L357705,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Why not?
64789,L357704,u1893,m124,CONWAY,You can't take her away from here!
64790,L357702,u1894,m124,GEORGE,She's going with me.
64791,L357701,u1893,m124,CONWAY,What's she got to do with it?
64792,L357700,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Yes, the little Russian girl."
64793,L357699,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Maria?
64794,L357698,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
64795,L357697,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?"
64796,L357696,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob."
64797,L357695,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying."
64798,L357694,u1894,m124,GEORGE,I'd go mad!
64799,L357693,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?"
64800,L357692,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob."
64801,L357691,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, George . . ."
64802,L357690,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you."
64803,L357689,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?"
64804,L357688,u1894,m124,GEORGE,It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
64805,L357687,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
64806,L357686,u1894,m124,GEORGE,You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
64807,L357685,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore."
64808,L357684,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?"
64809,L357683,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you."
64810,L357682,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
64811,L357681,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Is that all my story meant to you?
64812,L357680,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible."
64813,L357679,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I don't need any proof.
64814,L357678,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?"
64815,L357677,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"So you think it's all nonsense, huh?"
64816,L357676,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century."
64817,L357675,u1893,m124,CONWAY,So you think I'm mad?
64818,L357674,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad."
64819,L357672,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . ."
64820,L357671,u1894,m124,GEORGE,I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
64821,L357670,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either."
64822,L357669,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?"
64823,L357668,u1893,m124,CONWAY,You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
64824,L357667,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Why not? What's going to stop me?
64825,L357666,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You can't leave, George."
64826,L357665,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?"
64827,L357594,u1894,m124,GEORGE,I don't see that there's anything to say.
64828,L357593,u1893,m124,CONWAY,George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
64829,L357445,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight."
64830,L357444,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of"
64831,L357442,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Why - I'm sorry - but I
64832,L357441,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
64833,L357440,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Porters?
64834,L357439,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What about the porters?
64835,L357392,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"All right. Sorry, George."
64836,L357391,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Let me up! Let me up!
64837,L357387,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Chang! Chang! Chang!
64838,L357386,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George, come back!"
64839,L357385,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Let me go, Bob!"
64840,L357384,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George, what do you think you're doing?"
64841,L357349,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Shhh!
64842,L357348,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners."
64843,L357347,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?"
64844,L357346,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing."
64845,L357345,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Porters?
64846,L357344,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Nothing about the porters yet?
64847,L357343,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners."
64848,L357264,u1893,m124,CONWAY,That's what's on the other side of the hill.
64849,L357263,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?"
64850,L357262,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Uh-huh.
64851,L357261,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Chang's first question was about the pilot.
64852,L357260,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?"
64853,L357259,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here."
64854,L357258,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Well - I mean
64855,L357257,u1894,m124,GEORGE,That's what you said.
64856,L357256,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Did I say ""if""?"
64857,L357255,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What do you mean if we should get out?
64858,L357254,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father."
64859,L357253,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now."
64860,L357252,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
64861,L357251,u1894,m124,GEORGE,You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
64862,L357250,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I don't know.
64863,L357249,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What are you talking about?
64864,L357248,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?"
64865,L357247,u1894,m124,GEORGE,You talk as though you intend on staying.
64866,L357246,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here."
64867,L357245,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all."
64868,L357244,u1893,m124,CONWAY,We've had plenty of it the last few days.
64869,L357243,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
64870,L357242,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Hello, George.  Cigarette?"
64871,L357108,u1893,m124,CONWAY,It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
64872,L357107,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What's it mean?
64873,L357106,u1893,m124,CONWAY,That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
64874,L357105,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Yes.
64875,L357104,u1893,m124,CONWAY,See that spot?
64876,L357103,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What is it?
64877,L357101,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Dead?
64878,L357100,u1893,m124,CONWAY,He's dead.
64879,L357098,u1893,m124,CONWAY,It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
64880,L357097,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What is it? Has he fainted?
64881,L357084,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there."
64882,L357083,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh George, come on."
64883,L357064,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
64884,L357063,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What are these people?
64885,L357048,u1894,m124,GEORGE,I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
64886,L357047,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"George, what are you going to do?"
64887,L357034,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something."
64888,L357033,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, stop it!"
64889,L356995,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep."
64890,L356994,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Do try to sleep, Bob."
64891,L356993,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else."
64892,L356991,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, ""Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?""  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - ""Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?"" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants  and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum."
64893,L356990,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob."
64894,L356989,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count."
64895,L356988,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Yes.
64896,L356987,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Did you say we saved ninety white people?
64897,L356986,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Yes, Bob."
64898,L356985,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?"
64899,L356982,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
64900,L356981,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, ""There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."""
64901,L356980,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Hurray!
64902,L356979,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary."
64903,L356978,u1893,m124,CONWAY,You?
64904,L356977,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Just what I needed too.
64905,L356943,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later."
64906,L356942,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul."
64907,L356926,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Come on! Quick! This way.
64908,L356925,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Bob, these are all that are left."
64909,L356921,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Right, Bob."
64910,L356920,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left."
64911,L356919,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
64912,L356918,u1894,m124,GEORGE,The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
64913,L356904,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Hello? Colonel?
64914,L356903,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Yes.
64915,L356902,u1893,m124,CONWAY,And be sure that none of the natives get in.
64916,L356901,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Yes.
64917,L356900,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here."
64918,L356899,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Bob! I think I hear motors!
64919,L357152,u1893,m124,CONWAY,We'd be eternally grateful if you
64920,L357151,u1898,m124,LOVETT,At the mercy of a mad pilot.
64921,L357080,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing."
64922,L357079,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
64923,L357067,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Where are we going? Huh?
64924,L357066,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning."
64925,L357060,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know."
64926,L357059,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!"
64927,L357058,u1893,m124,CONWAY,What do you suggest?
64928,L357057,u1898,m124,LOVETT,You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
64929,L357056,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out."
64930,L357055,u1898,m124,LOVETT,In for what?
64931,L357054,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I guess we're in for it.
64932,L357052,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
64933,L357051,u1898,m124,LOVETT,We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
64934,L357050,u1893,m124,CONWAY,What if he refuses?
64935,L357049,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Good.
64936,L357046,u1898,m124,LOVETT,What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
64937,L357045,u1893,m124,CONWAY,That fellow got on at Baskul.
64938,L357044,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
64939,L357043,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened."
64940,L356941,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
64941,L356940,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly"
64942,L356939,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Where were you hiding?
64943,L356936,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Why aren't you registered through our office?
64944,L356935,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir."
64945,L356934,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Where did you come from?
64946,L357564,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms."
64947,L357563,u1900,m124,SONDRA,I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
64948,L357561,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Why?
64949,L357560,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I'd love it!
64950,L357559,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Would you like to wring my little neck?
64951,L357558,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck."
64952,L357557,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"Why, mother?"
64953,L357556,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling."
64954,L357555,u1900,m124,SONDRA,I was just going to.
64955,L357554,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why."
64956,L357553,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Why?
64957,L357552,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on."
64958,L357551,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"Struggling, why?"
64959,L357550,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence."
64960,L357549,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Why?
64961,L357548,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected."
64962,L357547,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive."
64963,L357546,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?"
64964,L357545,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"You see, it's not a dream."
64965,L357544,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Ouch!
64966,L357543,u1893,m124,CONWAY,When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
64967,L357542,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Bump?
64968,L357541,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
64969,L357497,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
64970,L357496,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley."
64971,L357495,u1893,m124,CONWAY,I wonder.
64972,L357494,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
64973,L357493,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?"
64974,L357492,u1900,m124,SONDRA,I'm so glad.
64975,L357491,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here."
64976,L357490,u1900,m124,SONDRA,I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
64977,L357489,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely."
64978,L357488,u1900,m124,SONDRA,What is?
64979,L357485,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, you're going to make life very simple."
64980,L357484,u1900,m124,SONDRA,I'm thirty.
64981,L357483,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
64982,L357482,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"Yes, I know."
64983,L357481,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
64984,L357480,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself."
64985,L357479,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Thank you.
64986,L357478,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here."
64987,L357477,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin."
64988,L357476,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!"
64989,L357475,u1900,m124,SONDRA,I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
64990,L357474,u1893,m124,CONWAY,You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
64991,L357473,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Yes.
64992,L357472,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?"
64993,L357471,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark."
64994,L357470,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it."
64995,L357469,u1893,m124,CONWAY,A man whose life was empty!
64996,L357468,u1900,m124,SONDRA,I saw a man whose life was empty.
64997,L357467,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?"
64998,L357466,u1900,m124,SONDRA,That was easy. I read your books.
64999,L357465,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?"
65000,L357464,u1900,m124,SONDRA,Yes. Hold this pigeon.
65001,L357463,u1893,m124,CONWAY,Was this your idea?
65002,L357460,u1900,m124,SONDRA,"Oh, you mean my pigeons."
65003,L357459,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?"
65004,L357458,u1893,m124,CONWAY,hope you'll forgive me for
65005,L357457,u1900,m124,SONDRA,My name's Sondra.
65006,L357456,u1893,m124,CONWAY,"Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time."
65007,L357654,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Yes.  Barney!
65008,L357653,u1894,m124,GEORGE,You'll wait till you rot!
65009,L357652,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait."
65010,L357651,u1894,m124,GEORGE,I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
65011,L357650,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started."
65012,L357649,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
65013,L357648,u1898,m124,LOVETT,Go? Where?
65014,L357647,u1894,m124,GEORGE,How about you? Do you want to go?
65015,L357231,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?"
65016,L357230,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague."
65017,L357205,u1894,m124,GEORGE,The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
65018,L357204,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home."
65019,L357147,u1898,m124,LOVETT,English!
65020,L357146,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Why, he's speaking English."
65021,L357130,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff."
65022,L357129,u1898,m124,LOVETT,What is it?
65023,L357082,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary."
65024,L357081,u1894,m124,GEORGE,What do you want him to do?
65025,L357026,u1898,m124,LOVETT,It's Fenner.
65026,L357025,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
65027,L357024,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!"
65028,L357023,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
65029,L356938,u1898,m124,LOVETT,"How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape."
65030,L356937,u1894,m124,GEORGE,It would serve you right if you were left behind.
65031,L357539,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!"
65032,L357538,u1899,m124,MARIA,Thank you.
65033,L357537,u1894,m124,GEORGE,"All right, I'll be there."
65034,L357536,u1899,m124,MARIA,Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
65035,L357535,u1894,m124,GEORGE,Perhaps.
65036,L357534,u1899,m124,MARIA,I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
65037,L357533,u1894,m124,GEORGE,I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
65038,L357532,u1899,m124,MARIA,You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
65039,L357278,u1899,m124,MARIA,Please don't go.

65043,L381601,u1906,m125,KAY,"It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after."
65044,L381598,u1906,m125,KAY,"Oh, you'll still, be guarding him."
65045,L381597,u1901,m125,COWAN,Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
65046,L381591,u1901,m125,COWAN,I gotta be honest about something.
65047,L381590,u1906,m125,KAY,No. just peace on Earth.

65057,L381565,u1906,m125,KAY,"It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day."
65058,L381564,u1901,m125,COWAN,"Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?"
65059,L381558,u1906,m125,KAY,Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
65060,L381557,u1901,m125,COWAN,"of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--"

65072,L381542,u1906,m125,KAY,The hell happened?
65073,L381643,u1913,m125,ZED,No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
65074,L381642,u1901,m125,COWAN,It'll make sense later?

65076,L381640,u1901,m125,COWAN,"So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it."

65097,L381511,u1913,m125,ZED,Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
65098,L381510,u1901,m125,COWAN,... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
65099,L381505,u1901,m125,COWAN,"Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir."

65104,L381500,u1911,m125,WALLACE,"Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors."
65105,L381499,u1901,m125,COWAN,"Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--"
65106,L381498,u1911,m125,WALLACE,Well this didn't.

65109,L381495,u1901,m125,COWAN,"Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--"

65146,L381401,u1903,m125,INS LEADER,What?  Who the hell are you?
65147,L381400,u1906,m125,KAY,We'll take it from here.
65148,L382278,u1904,m125,JAY,"Oh no, I can't do this job by myself."
65149,L382277,u1906,m125,KAY,I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
65150,L382276,u1904,m125,JAY,"Kay, you're scaring your partner."
65151,L382275,u1906,m125,KAY,"Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful."
65152,L382274,u1904,m125,JAY,"Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people."
65153,L382270,u1906,m125,KAY,"There wasn't time, sport!"

65155,L382268,u1906,m125,KAY,And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
65156,L382267,u1904,m125,JAY,After I got the shit beat out of me!
65157,L382266,u1904,m125,JAY,Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
65158,L382265,u1906,m125,KAY,You were saying?
65159,L382217,u1904,m125,JAY,Kay!?

65162,L382151,u1904,m125,JAY,in case I need it?
65163,L382150,u1906,m125,KAY,"Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--"
65164,L382149,u1904,m125,JAY,Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
65165,L382148,u1906,m125,KAY,"Right.  Oh, and here."

65167,L382146,u1906,m125,KAY,I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
65168,L382136,u1906,m125,KAY,I'd double it and add 20.
65169,L382135,u1904,m125,JAY,Would you call this a code 100?
65170,L382120,u1904,m125,JAY,All of it?
65171,L382119,u1906,m125,KAY,It's marble.
65172,L382114,u1904,m125,JAY,"Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?"
65173,L382113,u1906,m125,KAY,We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
65174,L382112,u1904,m125,JAY,For how long?
65175,L382111,u1906,m125,KAY,Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
65176,L382103,u1906,m125,KAY,Since as long as we've been keeping records...
65177,L382102,u1904,m125,JAY,Since how long?
65178,L382045,u1906,m125,KAY,"Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?"
65179,L382044,u1904,m125,JAY,What are you doing?
65180,L382040,u1904,m125,JAY,"That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here."
65181,L382039,u1906,m125,KAY,Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
65182,L382038,u1904,m125,JAY,I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
65183,L382037,u1906,m125,KAY,I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
65184,L382036,u1904,m125,JAY,Kay.  All I'm saying--
65185,L382035,u1906,m125,KAY,"Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs."
65186,L382034,u1904,m125,JAY,"Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true."
65187,L382033,u1906,m125,KAY,How does that help me?
65188,L382032,u1904,m125,JAY,"Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?"
65189,L382031,u1906,m125,KAY,He's here to help!?
65190,L382028,u1906,m125,KAY,Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
65191,L382027,u1904,m125,JAY,Kay--
65192,L382016,u1906,m125,KAY,You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
65193,L382015,u1904,m125,JAY,What if he's telling the truth?
65194,L382014,u1906,m125,KAY,"Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you."
65195,L382000,u1904,m125,JAY,"I dunno, man.  Maybe we should."
65196,L381999,u1906,m125,KAY,"""Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."""
65197,L381945,u1904,m125,JAY,The Pentagon.
65198,L381944,u1906,m125,KAY,Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
65199,L381926,u1906,m125,KAY,We're rising.
65200,L381925,u1904,m125,JAY,Jesus Christ...
65201,L381924,u1906,m125,KAY,Get back in the car!
65202,L381923,u1904,m125,JAY,Jesus...
65203,L381919,u1904,m125,JAY,That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
65204,L381918,u1906,m125,KAY,Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
65205,L381900,u1906,m125,KAY,I think that's what's happening...
65206,L381899,u1904,m125,JAY,You think that's what's-happening?
65207,L381898,u1906,m125,KAY,"No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards."
65208,L381897,u1904,m125,JAY,The radio show?
65209,L381896,u1906,m125,KAY,"I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds."
65210,L381895,u1904,m125,JAY,"What's going on, Kay?"
65211,L381873,u1906,m125,KAY,Where to?
65212,L381872,u1904,m125,JAY,Looks like a train ticket.
65213,L381871,u1906,m125,KAY,What?
65214,L381870,u1904,m125,JAY,And what's this ... ?
65215,L381869,u1906,m125,KAY,Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
65216,L381868,u1904,m125,JAY,I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
65217,L381867,u1906,m125,KAY,Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
65218,L381866,u1904,m125,JAY,Gee.  You really think?
65219,L381865,u1906,m125,KAY,Something's wrong here.
65220,L381831,u1906,m125,KAY,There's a god damn good reason.
65221,L381830,u1904,m125,JAY,There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
65222,L381829,u1906,m125,KAY,He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
65223,L381802,u1906,m125,KAY,Hold it.
65224,L381801,u1904,m125,JAY,Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
65225,L381800,u1906,m125,KAY,A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
65226,L381796,u1906,m125,KAY,"History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems."
65227,L381795,u1904,m125,JAY,Now what?
65228,L381792,u1904,m125,JAY,A what?
65229,L381791,u1906,m125,KAY,Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
65230,L381790,u1904,m125,JAY,"I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead."
65231,L381789,u1906,m125,KAY,"Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?"
65232,L381787,u1906,m125,KAY,It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
65233,L381786,u1904,m125,JAY,what's this?
65234,L381776,u1906,m125,KAY,Let's check am out.
65235,L381775,u1904,m125,JAY,"I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn."
65236,L381774,u1906,m125,KAY,"If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?"
65237,L381773,u1904,m125,JAY,"Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me."
65238,L381772,u1906,m125,KAY,Something seem unusual to you about that?
65239,L381771,u1904,m125,JAY,What?
65240,L381749,u1906,m125,KAY,Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
65241,L381748,u1904,m125,JAY,"Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?"
65242,L381747,u1904,m125,JAY,Um-- Kay?
65243,L381746,u1906,m125,KAY,You don't know me at all.
65244,L381745,u1904,m125,JAY,"Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--"
65245,L381744,u1906,m125,KAY,Why?
65246,L381743,u1904,m125,JAY,"Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up."
65247,L381741,u1906,m125,KAY,It was a long time ago.-
65248,L381740,u1904,m125,JAY,"Ha ha.  No, really."
65249,L381739,u1906,m125,KAY,I taught kindergarten.
65250,L381738,u1904,m125,JAY,"What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?"
65251,L381737,u1906,m125,KAY,You don't know the half of it.
65252,L381736,u1904,m125,JAY,"I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long."
65253,L381735,u1906,m125,KAY,"If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it."
65254,L381734,u1904,m125,JAY,"I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah."
65255,L381733,u1906,m125,KAY,"Just so I understand... you're ""thing"" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--"
65256,L381732,u1904,m125,JAY,"Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing."
65257,L381731,u1906,m125,KAY,"Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time."
65258,L381730,u1904,m125,JAY,"I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself."
65259,L381729,u1906,m125,KAY,She didn't even know you. .
65260,L381728,u1904,m125,JAY,I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
65261,L381694,u1904,m125,JAY,"I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here.."
65262,L381693,u1906,m125,KAY,Keep her out of here while I check it out.
65263,L381692,u1904,m125,JAY,"I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room."
65264,L381668,u1906,m125,KAY,"This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival."
65265,L381667,u1904,m125,JAY,"I know, but we're on a college campus..."
65266,L381666,u1906,m125,KAY,It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
65267,L381665,u1904,m125,JAY,"I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo."
65268,L381660,u1904,m125,JAY,"Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh..."
65269,L381659,u1906,m125,KAY,So what's the problem?
65270,L381658,u1904,m125,JAY,So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
65271,L381655,u1904,m125,JAY,But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
65272,L381654,u1906,m125,KAY,Right.
65273,L381653,u1904,m125,JAY,It's a bug.
65274,L381650,u1904,m125,JAY,"I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them."
65275,L381649,u1906,m125,KAY,The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
65276,L381648,u1904,m125,JAY,"Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?"
65277,L381647,u1906,m125,KAY,We wear black.
65278,L381646,u1904,m125,JAY,"Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity."
65279,L382030,u1904,m125,JAY,Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
65280,L382029,u1913,m125,ZED,I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
65281,L382022,u1913,m125,ZED,"Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on."
65282,L382021,u1904,m125,JAY,Sure.
65283,L382013,u1904,m125,JAY,"You know, there's something we never really thought of..."
65284,L382012,u1913,m125,ZED,Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
65285,L381938,u1904,m125,JAY,Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
65286,L381937,u1913,m125,ZED,Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
65287,L381936,u1904,m125,JAY,I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
65288,L382236,u1904,m125,JAY,Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
65289,L382235,u1907,m125,LAUREL,Yeah ... ?
65290,L382234,u1904,m125,JAY,"They respond to fear, right?"
65291,L382233,u1907,m125,LAUREL,What are you doing?
65292,L382230,u1907,m125,LAUREL,Are you sure you don't?
65293,L382229,u1904,m125,JAY,What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
65294,L382228,u1907,m125,LAUREL,The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
65295,L382227,u1904,m125,JAY,Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
65296,L382189,u1907,m125,LAUREL,Out of focus?
65297,L382188,u1904,m125,JAY,Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
65298,L382157,u1904,m125,JAY,Actually... I don't know.
65299,L382156,u1907,m125,LAUREL,What the hell does that mean?
65300,L382155,u1904,m125,JAY,What do we do?    Lean into it.
65301,L382154,u1907,m125,LAUREL,What do we do?
65302,L382110,u1904,m125,JAY,So... how did they get here?
65303,L382109,u1907,m125,LAUREL,It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
65304,L382108,u1904,m125,JAY,When?
65305,L382099,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all."
65306,L382098,u1904,m125,JAY,"But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?"
65307,L382097,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa."
65308,L382096,u1904,m125,JAY,What is it?
65309,L382095,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"I swear to God, that was not here two days ago..."
65310,L382075,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Well, first of all, it's entomologist."
65311,L382074,u1904,m125,JAY,Why not?
65312,L382073,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way."
65313,L382072,u1904,m125,JAY,I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
65314,L382071,u1907,m125,LAUREL,It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
65315,L382068,u1904,m125,JAY,"Actually, you may have."
65316,L382067,u1907,m125,LAUREL,Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
65317,L381710,u1907,m125,LAUREL,Do have any idea what I just said?
65318,L381709,u1904,m125,JAY,Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
65319,L381708,u1907,m125,LAUREL,With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
65320,L381707,u1904,m125,JAY,"Right, right-- I like that stuff."
65321,L381698,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work."
65322,L381697,u1904,m125,JAY,"Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work."
65323,L381696,u1907,m125,LAUREL,So... how'd you hear about this?
65324,L381683,u1904,m125,JAY,I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
65325,L381682,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring."
65326,L381681,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?"
65327,L381680,u1904,m125,JAY,"So, I guess you could say you're really into insects..."
65328,L381864,u1905,m125,JEEBS,You're not taking me in!
65329,L381863,u1906,m125,KAY,"Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown."
65330,L381853,u1906,m125,KAY,And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
65331,L381852,u1905,m125,JEEBS,"Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you."
65332,L381851,u1906,m125,KAY,And I'm arranging deportation papers.
65333,L381850,u1905,m125,JEEBS,"I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?"
65334,L381849,u1906,m125,KAY,Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
65335,L381847,u1905,m125,JEEBS,"I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids."
65336,L381846,u1906,m125,KAY,You figured what?
65337,L381845,u1905,m125,JEEBS,The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
65338,L381839,u1906,m125,KAY,Maybe you need a closer look.
65339,L381838,u1905,m125,JEEBS,No.
65340,L381837,u1906,m125,KAY,"What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?"
65341,L382195,u1912,m125,YAZ,"Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated."
65342,L382194,u1906,m125,KAY,Goodwill...
65343,L382179,u1912,m125,YAZ,"Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough."
65344,L382178,u1906,m125,KAY,"Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?"
65345,L381997,u1906,m125,KAY,"No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that."
65346,L381996,u1912,m125,YAZ,Come on now.  People are smart.
65347,L381995,u1906,m125,KAY,"Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist."
65348,L381994,u1912,m125,YAZ,How could it not?
65349,L381993,u1906,m125,KAY,"Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?"
65350,L381430,u1906,m125,KAY,"What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?"

65352,L381428,u1906,m125,KAY,Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
65353,L381427,u1909,m125,MIKEY,I dunno. One?
65354,L381426,u1906,m125,KAY,"Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?"
65355,L381425,u1909,m125,MIKEY,"Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up."
65356,L381424,u1906,m125,KAY,"I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon."
65357,L381423,u1909,m125,MIKEY,"Er. well, nowhere special."
65358,L381422,u1906,m125,KAY,"Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere."
65359,L381421,u1909,m125,MIKEY,Nowhere.
65360,L382130,u1906,m125,KAY,Cause I think we're looking at it.
65361,L382129,u1914,m125,ZED'S VOICE,How'd you know that?  Kay?
65362,L382128,u1906,m125,KAY,"Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?"
65363,L382127,u1914,m125,ZED'S VOICE,"Actually, yeah--"
65364,L382126,u1906,m125,KAY,Did he say where?
65365,L382125,u1914,m125,ZED'S VOICE,Noon exactly.
65366,L382124,u1906,m125,KAY,Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
65367,L382123,u1914,m125,ZED'S VOICE,"Yeah, Kay?"
65368,L382122,u1906,m125,KAY,"I know what this is.    Zed, you in?"
65369,L381702,u1914,m125,ZED'S VOICE,Nope.  Nothing at all.
65370,L381701,u1906,m125,KAY,Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
65371,L381700,u1914,m125,ZED'S VOICE,Nothing.
65372,L381699,u1906,m125,KAY,"... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?"

65377,L381821,u1908,m125,LEONARD,"I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing..."
65378,L381819,u1908,m125,LEONARD,I promised I wouldn't tell.
65379,L381818,u1906,m125,KAY,"Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood."
65380,L381817,u1908,m125,LEONARD,Found it.
65381,L381812,u1908,m125,LEONARD,I wanna make a deal.
65382,L381811,u1906,m125,KAY,I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
65383,L381810,u1908,m125,LEONARD,Will it lower the curve?
65384,L381809,u1906,m125,KAY,In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
65385,L381808,u1908,m125,LEONARD,What if I don't?
65386,L381807,u1906,m125,KAY,They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
65387,L381806,u1908,m125,LEONARD,They're not my pals--
65388,L381805,u1906,m125,KAY,Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--

65390,L382141,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Really nice wheels, by the way."

65395,L381725,u1906,m125,KAY,"But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before."
65396,L381724,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--"
65397,L381716,u1907,m125,LAUREL,Come again?
65398,L381715,u1906,m125,KAY,"We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere."
65399,L381689,u1906,m125,KAY,May I have a look?
65400,L381688,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this."
65401,L381686,u1907,m125,LAUREL,"Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this."
65402,L381685,u1906,m125,KAY,This it?
65403,L381677,u1907,m125,LAUREL,Scientific American?  Really?
65404,L381676,u1906,m125,KAY,We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
65405,L382094,u1906,m125,KAY,Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
65406,L382093,u1913,m125,ZED,How'd you know?
65407,L382090,u1906,m125,KAY,Don't tell me.  Insects.
65408,L382089,u1913,m125,ZED,And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
65409,L382088,u1913,m125,ZED,"I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system."
65410,L382087,u1906,m125,KAY,Yeah?  What's up?
65411,L382049,u1906,m125,KAY,Oh shit!

65414,L382046,u1913,m125,ZED,"Well, it wasn't in the jar..."
65415,L382009,u1913,m125,ZED,They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
65416,L382008,u1906,m125,KAY,Where's he making his big speech?
65417,L382007,u1913,m125,ZED,"As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public."
65418,L381956,u1906,m125,KAY,They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
65419,L381955,u1913,m125,ZED,They went right to the President.
65420,L381954,u1906,m125,KAY,And they're buying it?
65421,L381943,u1913,m125,ZED,What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
65422,L381942,u1906,m125,KAY,I'm getting a trajectory...
65423,L381933,u1906,m125,KAY,Dee?  What are you doing here?

65425,L381888,u1906,m125,KAY,Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
65426,L381887,u1913,m125,ZED,Hard to tell.  I hope not.
65427,L381886,u1906,m125,KAY,"Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?"
65428,L381885,u1913,m125,ZED,Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
65429,L381884,u1913,m125,ZED,Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
65430,L381883,u1906,m125,KAY,What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
65431,L381882,u1913,m125,ZED,"He's gone, too."
65432,L381780,u1906,m125,KAY,What the hell is going on?
65433,L381779,u1913,m125,ZED,"I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school."
65434,L381778,u1906,m125,KAY,"Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?"
65435,L381777,u1913,m125,ZED,Kay?  What's your 20?
65436,L381596,u1913,m125,ZED,"So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?"
65437,L381595,u1906,m125,KAY,"Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons."
65438,L381468,u1906,m125,KAY,Fine.  Good.
65439,L381467,u1913,m125,ZED,How's Dee?
65440,L381992,u1912,m125,YAZ,"That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it."
65441,L381991,u1910,m125,PRESIDENT,And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
65442,L381990,u1912,m125,YAZ,A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
65443,L381989,u1910,m125,PRESIDENT,"If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?"
65444,L381988,u1912,m125,YAZ,"Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it."
65445,L381987,u1912,m125,YAZ,"That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe."
65446,L381986,u1910,m125,PRESIDENT,"Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess."
65447,L381985,u1912,m125,YAZ,"Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?"
65448,L387158,u1915,m126,AGATHA,RUN!
65449,L387157,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What --
65450,L387156,u1915,m126,AGATHA,"I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again."
65451,L387153,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Oh, Jesus..."
65452,L387152,u1915,m126,AGATHA,"She's not alive, but she didn't die."
65453,L387151,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,She's still alive?
65454,L387150,u1915,m126,AGATHA,She grew up.
65455,L387149,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,She died?
65456,L387148,u1915,m126,AGATHA,The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
65457,L387147,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Who wanted her little girl back?
65458,L387146,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
65459,L387066,u1915,m126,AGATHA,I am going back.  I see myself there.
65460,L387065,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Agatha, you're never going back there."
65461,L387064,u1915,m126,AGATHA,"I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this."
65462,L387063,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
65463,L387062,u1915,m126,AGATHA,The other two will die without me.
65464,L387061,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Why?
65465,L387060,u1915,m126,AGATHA,I have to go back.
65466,L387059,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Someplace safe.
65467,L387058,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Where are we going?
65468,L386981,u1915,m126,AGATHA,But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
65469,L386980,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future."
65470,L386979,u1915,m126,AGATHA,"Please, I want to go back..."
65471,L386977,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You were right.  I'm not being set up.
65472,L386976,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Anderton --
65473,L386975,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
65474,L386973,u1915,m126,AGATHA,What is it?
65475,L386972,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Oh, God..."
65476,L386963,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
65477,L386962,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Please --
65478,L386961,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I can't.  I have to know.
65479,L386959,u1915,m126,AGATHA,"Anderton, leave."
65480,L386958,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,He's here.
65481,L386939,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Wait.
65482,L386938,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Agatha...
65483,L386937,u1915,m126,AGATHA,He won't.
65484,L386936,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,He'll turn around.
65485,L386935,u1915,m126,AGATHA,No.  Follow him.
65486,L386933,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
65487,L386932,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Forget that guy --
65488,L386931,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Drop some money.
65489,L386927,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What?
65490,L386926,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Can you see the balloon man?
65491,L386925,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Agatha --
65492,L386920,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Agatha...
65493,L386919,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Take it.

65495,L386913,u1915,m126,AGATHA,They're inside.
65496,L386912,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What?
65497,L386828,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Is it now?
65498,L386827,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What?
65499,L386826,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Is it now?
65500,L386825,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --"
65501,L386291,u1915,m126,AGATHA,Can you see?
65502,L386290,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Wally!
65503,L387155,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?"
65504,L387154,u1928,m126,LARA,John?  What is it?
65505,L387144,u1928,m126,LARA,"I know... I do, too..."
65506,L387143,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
65507,L387134,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Anne Lively...
65508,L387133,u1928,m126,LARA,About who?
65509,L387132,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Because I found out about her...
65510,L387131,u1928,m126,LARA,"Think, John.  Why would they set you up?"
65511,L387130,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Somewhere.
65512,L387129,u1928,m126,LARA,Found?  Where?
65513,L387128,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Just some guy... they found.
65514,L387127,u1928,m126,LARA,Then who was he?
65515,L387126,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,-- but he didn't.
65516,L386708,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,-- go blind.  I know.
65517,L386707,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --"
65518,L386702,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch."
65519,L386701,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,The nano... what?
65520,L386700,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes."
65521,L386699,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I can't even stand up --
65522,L386698,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
65523,L386697,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,Here --
65524,L386696,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,How do I find the --
65525,L386695,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
65526,L386644,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
65527,L386643,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before..."
65528,L386638,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?"
65529,L386637,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You set your patients on fire!
65530,L386636,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,They were performance pieces.
65531,L386635,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You made those tapes...
65532,L386634,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"Yes, you did."
65533,L386633,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I put you away --
65534,L386631,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
65535,L386630,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,From where?  D.C.?
65536,L386629,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"Oh, yes."
65537,L386628,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,We know each other?
65538,L386627,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"You don't remember me, do you?"
65539,L386626,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?"
65540,L386625,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,It's all I could safely move.
65541,L386624,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,That's not much.
65542,L386620,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"Whatever you say, John."
65543,L386619,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
65544,L386618,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,Why?
65545,L386617,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones."
65546,L386616,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,And replace them with new ones.
65547,L386615,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Yeah --
65548,L386614,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely."
65549,L386613,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Right.  I know --
65550,L386612,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
65551,L386611,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,That's comforting.
65552,L386610,u1921,m126,DR. EDDIE,"Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you."
65553,L387166,u1923,m126,GIDEON,It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
65554,L387165,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Lara --
65555,L387164,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome."
65556,L386348,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
65557,L386347,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic."
65558,L386346,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
65559,L386345,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, ""glitch?"""
65560,L386344,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch."
65561,L386343,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Try again.
65562,L386342,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"Huh, we don't seem to have her data."
65563,L386339,u1923,m126,GIDEON,On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
65564,L386338,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
65565,L386329,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"Not to mention, ""Saved by the bell""."
65566,L386328,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,... Graveyard shift.
65567,L386327,u1923,m126,GIDEON,Hence the expression...
65568,L386321,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome."
65569,L386320,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You the only sentry?
65570,L386319,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"For that, we have to go for a ride."
65571,L386318,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Show me just Agatha's data stream.
65572,L386317,u1923,m126,GIDEON,That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
65573,L386316,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,This is the official composite of the three precogs?
65574,L386315,u1923,m126,GIDEON,That's an old one.  One of our first.
65575,L386313,u1923,m126,GIDEON,This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
65576,L386312,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Victim's a white female.
65577,L386310,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Drowning.
65578,L386309,u1923,m126,GIDEON,Kill type?
65579,L386308,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder."
65580,L386307,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?"
65581,L386306,u1923,m126,GIDEON,"Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners."
65582,L386305,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You the sentry?
65583,L387313,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Then go ahead, pull the trigger."
65584,L387312,u1918,m126,BURGESS,No doubt.
65585,L387311,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
65586,L387301,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
65587,L387300,u1918,m126,BURGESS,People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
65588,L387254,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
65589,L387253,u1918,m126,BURGESS,John --
65590,L386470,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Everybody runs.
65591,L386469,u1918,m126,BURGESS,You can't run --
65592,L386468,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm not getting halo'd.
65593,L386467,u1918,m126,BURGESS,John.  Please.  Listen to me --
65594,L386463,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?"
65595,L386462,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --"
65596,L386461,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out."
65597,L386460,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Can you fake the cerebral output?
65598,L386459,u1918,m126,BURGESS,How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
65599,L386458,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
65600,L386457,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
65601,L386456,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
65602,L386455,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this..."
65603,L386454,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
65604,L386453,u1918,m126,BURGESS,And who the hell is that?
65605,L386452,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Somebody named Leo Crow.
65606,L386451,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
65607,L386450,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
65608,L386449,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?"
65609,L386448,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --"
65610,L386376,u1918,m126,BURGESS,No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
65611,L386375,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,We won't let them.
65612,L386374,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us."
65613,L386373,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I'm fine, Lamar."
65614,L386372,u1918,m126,BURGESS,What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
65615,L386371,u1918,m126,BURGESS,In the middle of the night?
65616,L386370,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I go running down there.
65617,L386369,u1918,m126,BURGESS,I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
65618,L386368,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm fine.
65619,L386367,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I."
65620,L386366,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What?
65621,L386365,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Lara called me.
65622,L386364,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John."
65623,L386363,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
65624,L386362,u1918,m126,BURGESS,So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
65625,L386361,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
65626,L386354,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
65627,L386353,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?"
65628,L386219,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Tuck in your shirt.
65629,L386218,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I understand.  What's the other thing?
65630,L386217,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first."
65631,L386216,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Yes, sir."
65632,L386215,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer."
65633,L386214,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I understand.  Sir.
65634,L386213,u1918,m126,BURGESS,You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
65635,L386212,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"Don't apologize, John."
65636,L386211,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --"
65637,L386210,u1918,m126,BURGESS,And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
65638,L386130,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Hang on, Lamar --"
65639,L386129,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
65640,L386128,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Uh-huh...
65641,L386127,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
65642,L386126,u1918,m126,BURGESS,The nation votes this week...
65643,L386125,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Don't worry, Lamar."
65644,L386124,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"Tell me not to worry, John."
65645,L386506,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"You don't have to chase me, Fletcher."
65646,L386505,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"You don't have to do this, Chief."
65647,L386504,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Everybody runs.
65648,L386503,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us."
65649,L386092,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I show a cop on horseback.
65650,L386091,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
65651,L386090,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect..."
65652,L386089,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"What he's doing now, we call ""scrubbing the image"", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen."
65653,L386081,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
65654,L386080,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"Uh, sir..."
65655,L386079,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --"
65656,L386078,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --"
65657,L386077,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"You're kidding, that's today?"
65658,L386076,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here."
65659,L386070,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
65660,L386069,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,Seventeen minutes.
65661,L386424,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Take your time.
65662,L386423,u1926,m126,JAD,"Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it..."
65663,L386422,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving."
65664,L386418,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window..."
65665,L386417,u1926,m126,JAD,Any ID on the shooter yet?
65666,L386416,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Confirm with trig and image.
65667,L386415,u1926,m126,JAD,That was easy.
65668,L386414,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours."
65669,L386409,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location."
65670,L386408,u1926,m126,JAD,I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
65671,L386407,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it."
65672,L386406,u1926,m126,JAD,The victim's name is Leo Crow.
65673,L386400,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
65674,L386399,u1926,m126,JAD,Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
65675,L386398,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Red Ball?
65676,L386396,u1926,m126,JAD,We're in motion on something.
65677,L386395,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
65678,L386278,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Go back to work.  All of you.
65679,L386277,u1926,m126,JAD,Sir?
65680,L386276,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Uh-huh.  Jad?
65681,L386275,u1926,m126,JAD,"Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops."
65682,L386274,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
65683,L386149,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Did Marks close the front door?!
65684,L386148,u1926,m126,JAD,What?
65685,L386147,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Did he close the front door?
65686,L386146,u1926,m126,JAD,Go ahead.
65687,L386133,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Now look at him...
65688,L386132,u1926,m126,JAD,Yeah?  So?
65689,L386131,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit."
65690,L386096,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Georgetown.
65691,L386095,u1926,m126,JAD,The mall?
65692,L386094,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,No maglev system.
65693,L386093,u1926,m126,JAD,Somewhere near the capital?
65694,L386068,u1926,m126,JAD,"From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m."
65695,L386067,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?"
65696,L386066,u1926,m126,JAD,Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
65697,L386057,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Run the subscription list...
65698,L386056,u1926,m126,JAD,We can't grab it...
65699,L386041,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard."
65700,L386040,u1926,m126,JAD,We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
65701,L386039,u1926,m126,JAD,"Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's."
65702,L386038,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Okay, Jad, what's coming?"
65703,L386445,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge."
65704,L386444,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You gonna tell on me?
65705,L386443,u1934,m126,WITWER,"It seems I've found a flaw, John  You."
65706,L386442,u1934,m126,WITWER,I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
65707,L386441,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You set me up...
65708,L386288,u1934,m126,WITWER,"I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally."
65709,L386287,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
65710,L386286,u1934,m126,WITWER,Flaws.
65711,L386285,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?"
65712,L386284,u1934,m126,WITWER,At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
65713,L386281,u1934,m126,WITWER,I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
65714,L386280,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What does he think of your chosen line of work?
65715,L386279,u1934,m126,WITWER,Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
65716,L386273,u1934,m126,WITWER,The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
65717,L386272,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Just a nickname.
65718,L386271,u1934,m126,WITWER,"But you call this room the ""temple""."
65719,L386270,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more."
65720,L386269,u1934,m126,WITWER,I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
65721,L386251,u1934,m126,WITWER,I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
65722,L386250,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,There's no question.  You don't have any.
65723,L386249,u1934,m126,WITWER,If it's a question of authority.
65724,L386248,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Maybe you didn't hear me.
65725,L386247,u1934,m126,WITWER,So I'll be the first one to go in then?
65726,L386246,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
65727,L386245,u1934,m126,WITWER,Really?  You've never been inside?
65728,L386244,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
65729,L386243,u1934,m126,WITWER,To them.
65730,L386242,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,To Hineman?
65731,L386241,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello."
65732,L386240,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface."
65733,L386237,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?"
65734,L386236,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do."
65735,L386235,u1934,m126,WITWER,"You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?"
65736,L386234,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
65737,L386233,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
65738,L386232,u1934,m126,WITWER,Yes.
65739,L386231,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You're certain?
65740,L386230,u1934,m126,WITWER,Because it was going to fall.
65741,L386229,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Why did you catch that?
65742,L386227,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Yes, it is."
65743,L386226,u1934,m126,WITWER,But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
65744,L386140,u1934,m126,WITWER,You mind if I tag along?
65745,L386139,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
65746,L386138,u1934,m126,WITWER,"As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago."
65747,L386087,u1934,m126,WITWER,Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
65748,L386086,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on."
65749,L386792,u1933,m126,WALLY,Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
65750,L386791,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Just go to the beginning!
65751,L386784,u1933,m126,WALLY,There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
65752,L386783,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Are these all of her previsions?
65753,L386777,u1933,m126,WALLY,"Oh... Hi, John."
65754,L386776,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me..."
65755,L386775,u1933,m126,WALLY,Do I know you?  Who are you?
65756,L386774,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Wally, listen to me..."
65757,L386301,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,She said...
65758,L386300,u1933,m126,WALLY,To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
65759,L386299,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,She spoke to me.
65760,L386298,u1933,m126,WALLY,It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
65761,L386297,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,She was looking right at me.
65762,L386296,u1933,m126,WALLY,She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
65763,L386295,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen..."
65764,L386294,u1933,m126,WALLY,Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
65765,L386266,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,It helps if you don't think of them as human.
65766,L386265,u1933,m126,WALLY,"They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either."
65767,L386257,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
65768,L386256,u1933,m126,WALLY,"I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!"
65769,L386911,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"Uh, I'll try..."
65770,L386910,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Rufus, play it back..."
65771,L386903,u1929,m126,RUFUS,I guess that's all of it.
65772,L386902,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What happened?  Where's the rest?
65773,L386898,u1929,m126,RUFUS,Tell me how.
65774,L386897,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Stop --
65775,L386891,u1929,m126,RUFUS,Then take her to Radio Shack.
65776,L386890,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,They don't belong to anybody.
65777,L386889,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head."
65778,L386888,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,So now I need you to hack into her.
65779,L386887,u1929,m126,RUFUS,So?
65780,L386886,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking."
65781,L386885,u1929,m126,RUFUS,No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
65782,L386884,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
65783,L386883,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!"
65784,L386882,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up."
65785,L386881,u1929,m126,RUFUS,Are you reading my mind right now?
65786,L386879,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,That's right.
65787,L386878,u1929,m126,RUFUS,She's a precog?
65788,L386877,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Rufus.  She's a precog.
65789,L386876,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself."
65790,L386875,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"Well, hello there, honey-pie."
65791,L386874,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I need help with her.
65792,L386873,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls..."
65793,L386872,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I need your help.
65794,L386871,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?"
65795,L387192,u1931,m126,SEAN,"Hold your breath, Dad..."
65796,L387191,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Sean, wait..."
65797,L387190,u1931,m126,SEAN,I'm your son.  I'm you.
65798,L387189,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Who are you?
65799,L387188,u1931,m126,SEAN,"Good-bye, Dad..."
65800,L387187,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I wanted to.
65801,L387186,u1931,m126,SEAN,I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
65802,L387185,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I was looking for you...
65803,L387184,u1931,m126,SEAN,"The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled."
65804,L387183,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I forgive you...
65805,L387182,u1931,m126,SEAN,Once I even told him I loved him.
65806,L387181,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I forgive you.
65807,L387180,u1931,m126,SEAN,I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
65808,L387179,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Sean --
65809,L387178,u1931,m126,SEAN,"The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad."
65810,L387177,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Oh, Sean --"
65811,L387176,u1931,m126,SEAN,No.  He got tired of pretending.
65812,L387175,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You're alive?
65813,L387174,u1931,m126,SEAN,I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
65814,L387173,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What the hell.
65815,L387172,u1931,m126,SEAN,Wanna hear something funny?
65816,L387171,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,It's a little late for that.
65817,L387170,u1931,m126,SEAN,"You gotta have faith, Dad."
65818,L387169,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Sean -- you're not real.
65819,L386718,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"All right, I'll try..."
65820,L386717,u1931,m126,SEAN,Come on!
65821,L386716,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!"
65822,L386715,u1931,m126,SEAN,Okay... now let me time you.
65823,L386200,u1931,m126,SEAN,"I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad."
65824,L386199,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean."
65825,L386196,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What a big boy.  How old are you?
65826,L386195,u1931,m126,SEAN,I won!
65827,L386193,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,That's great.
65828,L386192,u1931,m126,SEAN,I scored a goal!
65829,L387028,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Good-bye, Crow."
65830,L387027,u1919,m126,CROW,You're not gonna kill me...
65831,L387026,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Let go of the gun.
65832,L387025,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Tell me!
65833,L387024,u1919,m126,CROW,Kill me!
65834,L387023,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Who made you do this?
65835,L387022,u1919,m126,CROW,"If I tell you, my family gets nothing."
65836,L387021,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Tell me, who was it, set this up?"
65837,L387020,u1919,m126,CROW,"Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!"
65838,L387019,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What about the picture --
65839,L387016,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What the fuck is going on?
65840,L387015,u1919,m126,CROW,"I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this."
65841,L387014,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"I'm asking you again, who made you do this?"
65842,L387013,u1919,m126,CROW,"Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --"
65843,L387012,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
65844,L387011,u1919,m126,CROW,"Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something."
65845,L387007,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Who said I would?
65846,L387006,u1919,m126,CROW,You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
65847,L387005,u1919,m126,CROW,"If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!"
65848,L387004,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,The precogs were wrong.
65849,L387003,u1919,m126,CROW,But you have to.  They said you would.
65850,L387002,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,No.
65851,L387001,u1919,m126,CROW,You're not gonna kill me?
65852,L386996,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,NO!
65853,L386995,u1919,m126,CROW,It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
65854,L386994,u1919,m126,CROW,I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
65855,L386993,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!"
65856,L386992,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,He's alive?
65857,L386991,u1919,m126,CROW,"... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy."
65858,L386989,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
65859,L386988,u1919,m126,CROW,Some -- somebody's father?
65860,L386987,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Do you know who I am?
65861,L386985,u1919,m126,CROW,Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
65862,L386984,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
65863,L386593,u1925,m126,IRIS,The female.
65864,L386592,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Which one is that?
65865,L386591,u1925,m126,IRIS,It's always in the more gifted of the three.
65866,L386590,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,How do I even know which one has it?
65867,L386585,u1925,m126,IRIS,"Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark."
65868,L386584,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
65869,L386583,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You're insane or you think I am.
65870,L386582,u1925,m126,IRIS,"Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do."
65871,L386581,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,-- and then walk out.
65872,L386580,u1925,m126,IRIS,If... you have one.
65873,L386579,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report..."
65874,L386578,u1925,m126,IRIS,Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
65875,L386577,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Where?
65876,L386576,u1925,m126,IRIS,The safest place of all.
65877,L386575,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What safe place is that?
65878,L386574,u1925,m126,IRIS,"I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared."
65879,L386573,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You said they're destroyed.
65880,L386572,u1925,m126,IRIS,You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
65881,L386571,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Why should I trust you?
65882,L386570,u1925,m126,IRIS,Hold that thought.
65883,L386569,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm not gonna kill anybody.
65884,L386568,u1925,m126,IRIS,"But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work."
65885,L386567,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You want to bring it down.
65886,L386566,u1925,m126,IRIS,Do you?  Really?
65887,L386565,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I believe in that system...
65888,L386564,u1925,m126,IRIS,The system would collapse.
65889,L386563,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,"Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --"
65890,L386562,u1925,m126,IRIS,"Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable."
65891,L386561,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
65892,L386560,u1925,m126,IRIS,"I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are."
65893,L386559,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
65894,L386558,u1925,m126,IRIS,"I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future."
65895,L386557,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
65896,L386556,u1925,m126,IRIS,"Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt."
65897,L386555,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Why?
65898,L386554,u1925,m126,IRIS,Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
65899,L386553,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
65900,L386552,u1925,m126,IRIS,"Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two."
65901,L386551,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What?
65902,L386549,u1925,m126,IRIS,I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
65903,L386548,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,So you won't help me?
65904,L386547,u1925,m126,IRIS,How can you avoid a man you've never met?
65905,L386546,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Not if I stay away from him.
65906,L386545,u1925,m126,IRIS,"And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death."
65907,L386544,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
65908,L386543,u1925,m126,IRIS,"So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?"
65909,L386542,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You say some of the children died?
65910,L386541,u1925,m126,IRIS,"Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You."
65911,L386540,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,And how did Lamar become involved?
65912,L386539,u1925,m126,IRIS,"It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening."
65913,L386537,u1925,m126,IRIS,You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
65914,L386536,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You're talking about the precogs...
65915,L386535,u1925,m126,IRIS,The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
65916,L386534,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,Heal who?
65917,L386533,u1925,m126,IRIS,"I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else."
65918,L386532,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You don't seem all that proud.
65919,L386531,u1925,m126,IRIS,"If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime."
65920,L386530,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,What's so funny?
65921,L386528,u1925,m126,IRIS,And how would I know that?
65922,L386527,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
65923,L386526,u1925,m126,IRIS,Just what is it you think I can do for you?
65924,L386522,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm... not... a... killer.
65925,L386521,u1925,m126,IRIS,You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
65926,L386516,u1925,m126,IRIS,The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
65927,L386515,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,The what?
65928,L386514,u1925,m126,IRIS,"Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye."
65929,L386513,u1916,m126,ANDERTON,I'm a little dizzy...
65930,L386512,u1925,m126,IRIS,Something wrong?
65931,L387054,u1917,m126,ANDERTON'S VOICE,"Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?"
65932,L387053,u1928,m126,LARA,Then how did he --
65933,L387052,u1917,m126,ANDERTON'S VOICE,Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
65934,L387051,u1928,m126,LARA,"Oh, God, what did you do?"
65935,L387050,u1917,m126,ANDERTON'S VOICE,"He's dead, Lara."
65936,L387049,u1928,m126,LARA,John?
65937,L387225,u1928,m126,LARA,Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
65938,L387224,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?"
65939,L387223,u1928,m126,LARA,Lamar --
65940,L387222,u1918,m126,BURGESS,But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
65941,L387220,u1928,m126,LARA,"No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once."
65942,L387219,u1918,m126,BURGESS,I understand.
65943,L387217,u1928,m126,LARA,No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
65944,L387216,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Sean --
65945,L387215,u1928,m126,LARA,"Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?"
65946,L387213,u1928,m126,LARA,He also said Crow was a fake.
65947,L387212,u1918,m126,BURGESS,We know why John was tagged.
65948,L387211,u1928,m126,LARA,"John said something about him being set up because he ""found out about her."""
65949,L387210,u1918,m126,BURGESS,I don't know who that is.
65950,L387209,u1928,m126,LARA,Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
65951,L387208,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Who?
65952,L387205,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that."
65953,L387204,u1928,m126,LARA,I thought you were retiring?
65954,L387203,u1918,m126,BURGESS,It's insanity around here.
65955,L387197,u1928,m126,LARA,You look great.
65956,L387196,u1918,m126,BURGESS,I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
65957,L387194,u1928,m126,LARA,"No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do."
65958,L387193,u1918,m126,BURGESS,This is all my fault.
65959,L387251,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Thank you.  This is Burgess.
65960,L387250,u1932,m126,SECRETARY,You have an emergency call on your private line.
65961,L387243,u1932,m126,SECRETARY,I padded your expense account for the last six months.
65962,L387242,u1918,m126,BURGESS,How did you get this?
65963,L387241,u1918,m126,BURGESS,My God...
65964,L387240,u1932,m126,SECRETARY,"Congratulations, sir."
65965,L387227,u1918,m126,BURGESS,I'll be right there.
65966,L387226,u1932,m126,SECRETARY,"Sir, the press conference is starting."
65967,L387202,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Not.  Now.
65968,L387201,u1932,m126,SECRETARY,He just wanted a few minutes before --
65969,L387200,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Tell him not now.
65970,L387199,u1932,m126,SECRETARY,The guy from USA Today is here.
65971,L387104,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see."
65972,L387103,u1934,m126,WITWER,What?
65973,L387102,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Shhh.  You know what I hear?
65974,L387101,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --"
65975,L387100,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Yes.
65976,L387099,u1934,m126,WITWER,So there is a way to fool the system?
65977,L387098,u1918,m126,BURGESS,We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
65978,L387097,u1934,m126,WITWER,Precog Deja Vu...
65979,L387096,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
65980,L387095,u1934,m126,WITWER,"By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way."
65981,L387094,u1918,m126,BURGESS,How?
65982,L387093,u1934,m126,WITWER,I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
65983,L387092,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"Danny, tell me what you're thinking."
65984,L387091,u1934,m126,WITWER,"I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?"
65985,L387090,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it."
65986,L387089,u1934,m126,WITWER,"According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged."
65987,L387088,u1934,m126,WITWER,This murder is happening at two different times.
65988,L387087,u1918,m126,BURGESS,I don't understand --
65989,L387086,u1934,m126,WITWER,Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
65990,L387084,u1934,m126,WITWER,Not quite.
65991,L387083,u1918,m126,BURGESS,It's the same prevision.
65992,L387082,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch..."
65993,L387081,u1918,m126,BURGESS,He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
65994,L387075,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Wait, just a second..."
65995,L387074,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Good God.  What was that?
65996,L387073,u1918,m126,BURGESS,Where are you?
65997,L387072,u1934,m126,WITWER,"I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man."
65998,L387071,u1918,m126,BURGESS,What?
65999,L387070,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Lamar, I found something."
66000,L386484,u1918,m126,BURGESS,I don't want John Anderton hurt.
66001,L386483,u1934,m126,WITWER,Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
66002,L386482,u1918,m126,BURGESS,He's my subordinate!
66003,L386481,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect."
66004,L386480,u1918,m126,BURGESS,None of your damn business.
66005,L386479,u1934,m126,WITWER,Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
66006,L386478,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"The man lost a child, for Christ's sake..."
66007,L386477,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it."
66008,L386476,u1918,m126,BURGESS,"The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree."
66009,L386475,u1934,m126,WITWER,He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
66010,L386870,u1929,m126,RUFUS,Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
66011,L386869,u1920,m126,CUSTOMER,"No, I wanna kill my boss!"
66012,L386868,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices..."
66013,L386866,u1929,m126,RUFUS,Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
66014,L386865,u1920,m126,CUSTOMER,Right here.
66015,L386864,u1929,m126,RUFUS,Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
66016,L386863,u1920,m126,CUSTOMER,I wanna kill my boss.
66017,L386862,u1929,m126,RUFUS,"Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack."
66018,L387047,u1934,m126,WITWER,None.  This was arranged.
66019,L387046,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,How many?
66020,L387045,u1934,m126,WITWER,"I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an ""orgy of evidence"".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?"
66021,L387044,u1934,m126,WITWER,Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
66022,L387043,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
66023,L387042,u1934,m126,WITWER,What kind of cop were you before this?
66024,L387041,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
66025,L387040,u1934,m126,WITWER,"If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?"
66026,L387039,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"I don't know, why?"
66027,L387038,u1934,m126,WITWER,There a maid in this hotel?
66028,L386858,u1934,m126,WITWER,No.  He can't...
66029,L386857,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
66030,L386856,u1934,m126,WITWER,He's trying to prove his innocence.
66031,L386820,u1934,m126,WITWER,She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
66032,L386819,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,We can stop him.
66033,L386818,u1934,m126,WITWER,It doesn't matter.  He wins.
66034,L386768,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,Two?
66035,L386767,u1934,m126,WITWER,There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
66036,L386604,u1934,m126,WITWER,Because he thinks he's innocent.
66037,L386603,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?"
66038,L386602,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him."
66039,L386600,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,They're everywhere.
66040,L386599,u1934,m126,WITWER,There's thousands of units like this one.
66041,L386598,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --"
66042,L386496,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Yes, I know."
66043,L386495,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men."
66044,L386473,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,What?!
66045,L386472,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team."
66046,L386471,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
66047,L386239,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman."
66048,L386238,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"Because of the nature of murder.  ""There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another""."
66049,L386221,u1934,m126,WITWER,I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
66050,L386220,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate."
66051,L386110,u1934,m126,WITWER,People have gotten the message.  Gum?
66052,L386109,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
66053,L386108,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,That's the Red Ball Alarm.
66054,L386107,u1934,m126,WITWER,Can't they shut that off?
66055,L386103,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run."
66056,L386102,u1934,m126,WITWER,"So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami."
66057,L386098,u1934,m126,WITWER,Nice to meet you.  Gum?
66058,L386097,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"This is Evanna, the team pilot."
66059,L387238,u1927,m126,KNOTT,"You ""friend's"" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder..."
66060,L387237,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,John Anderton was my friend!
66061,L387236,u1927,m126,KNOTT,Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
66062,L387235,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,Why don't I feel like celebrating?
66063,L386741,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,Knott!
66064,L386740,u1927,m126,KNOTT,"People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you."
66065,L386729,u1927,m126,KNOTT,"It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance..."
66066,L386728,u1922,m126,FLETCHER,"I think you're swell company, Knott."
66067,L386727,u1927,m126,KNOTT,"That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?"
66068,L386154,u1924,m126,HOWARD,I forgot my glasses.
66069,L386153,u1930,m126,SARAH,Howard --
66070,L386120,u1924,m126,HOWARD,Sure.  Raincheck.
66071,L386119,u1930,m126,SARAH,Raincheck?
66072,L386118,u1924,m126,HOWARD,Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
66073,L386117,u1930,m126,SARAH,"I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place."
66074,L386116,u1924,m126,HOWARD,We could have lunch together.
66075,L386114,u1924,m126,HOWARD,I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
66076,L386113,u1930,m126,SARAH,What about your meeting?
66077,L386065,u1930,m126,SARAH,How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
66078,L386064,u1924,m126,HOWARD,The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
66079,L386063,u1930,m126,SARAH,Who?
66080,L386062,u1924,m126,HOWARD,He looks familiar.
66081,L386692,u1934,m126,WITWER,But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
66082,L386691,u1928,m126,LARA,I haven't seen him in two years.
66083,L386690,u1934,m126,WITWER,"To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you."
66084,L386689,u1928,m126,LARA,To what?  Trap him?
66085,L386688,u1934,m126,WITWER,You know I need to use you.
66086,L386687,u1928,m126,LARA,"I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave."
66087,L386686,u1934,m126,WITWER,Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
66088,L386685,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd..."
66089,L386684,u1928,m126,LARA,"He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it."
66090,L386683,u1934,m126,WITWER,"He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara..."
66091,L386682,u1928,m126,LARA,"The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he..."
66092,L386681,u1934,m126,WITWER,What was it then?
66093,L386680,u1928,m126,LARA,It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
66094,L386679,u1934,m126,WITWER,You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
66095,L386678,u1928,m126,LARA,Yes.
66096,L386677,u1934,m126,WITWER,But John was with him at the pool?
66097,L386676,u1928,m126,LARA,It was nobody's fault.
66098,L386675,u1934,m126,WITWER,You mean after he lost your son.
66099,L386674,u1928,m126,LARA,Since right after we lost our son.
66100,L386671,u1934,m126,WITWER,Have you been there recently?
66101,L386670,u1928,m126,LARA,That was our apartment.
66102,L386669,u1934,m126,WITWER,So you haven't seen his apartment?
66103,L386668,u1928,m126,LARA,"No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore."
66104,L386667,u1934,m126,WITWER,You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
66105,L386666,u1928,m126,LARA,No.
66106,L386665,u1934,m126,WITWER,Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
66107,L386664,u1928,m126,LARA,I don't have any sugar either.
66108,L386662,u1934,m126,WITWER,"He's not here now, is he?"
66109,L386661,u1928,m126,LARA,"We used to, every summer."
66110,L386660,u1934,m126,WITWER,Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
66111,L386659,u1928,m126,LARA,I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
66112,L386658,u1934,m126,WITWER,Cream and sugar.
66113,L386657,u1928,m126,LARA,Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
66114,L386656,u1934,m126,WITWER,I like it.
66115,L386655,u1928,m126,LARA,Yes.
66116,L386654,u1934,m126,WITWER,This your work?
66117,L386653,u1928,m126,LARA,I know who you are.
66118,L386652,u1934,m126,WITWER,My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
66119,L386815,u1934,m126,WITWER,Jesus...
66120,L386814,u1933,m126,WALLY,"Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two."
66121,L386813,u1934,m126,WITWER,Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
66122,L386812,u1933,m126,WALLY,You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
66123,L386811,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Wally, the other two can still function, right?"
66124,L386810,u1934,m126,WITWER,But there's still the other two.
66125,L386809,u1933,m126,WALLY,What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
66126,L386808,u1934,m126,WITWER,What does he want with a precog?
66127,L386807,u1933,m126,WALLY,They've never been separated before.
66128,L386260,u1934,m126,WITWER,Tell me how all this works.
66129,L386259,u1933,m126,WALLY,Shhh!  They're sleeping.
66130,L386258,u1934,m126,WITWER,"Nice to meet you, Wally."
66131,L360354,u1935,m127,ARTHUR,Good luck.
66132,L360353,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening."
66133,L360352,u1935,m127,ARTHUR,"Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep."
66134,L360351,u1940,m127,BOBBY,They were grabbing her fucking ass --
66135,L360350,u1935,m127,ARTHUR,Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
66136,L360349,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What are you talking about?
66137,L360348,u1935,m127,ARTHUR,"Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up."
66138,L360362,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks."
66139,L360361,u1936,m127,AUDREY,You sure? I just made it.
66140,L360360,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No thank you.
66141,L360359,u1936,m127,AUDREY,"He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?"
66142,L360358,u1936,m127,AUDREY,"Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here."
66143,L360357,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah.
66144,L360356,u1936,m127,AUDREY,"You're Bobby, right?"
66145,L360355,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben."
66146,L360292,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
66147,L360291,u1937,m127,BARTENDER,We have snifters
66148,L360290,u1947,m127,HORRACE,What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
66149,L360289,u1937,m127,BARTENDER,When served warm --
66150,L360288,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Yeah, snifters are for cognac --"
66151,L360287,u1937,m127,BARTENDER,Snifter are for warm drinks --
66152,L360286,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
66153,L360689,u1952,m127,RICKY,See you later.
66154,L360688,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,It's on West Broadway.
66155,L360687,u1952,m127,RICKY,Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
66156,L360686,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though."
66157,L360685,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
66158,L360684,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,Women?
66159,L360683,u1952,m127,RICKY,Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
66160,L360682,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,As far as...?
66161,L360681,u1952,m127,RICKY,Where's the place to go tonight?
66162,L360680,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"Thank you, sir."
66163,L360679,u1952,m127,RICKY,No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
66164,L360678,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms."
66165,L360677,u1952,m127,RICKY,What if I gave you forty?
66166,L360676,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"Honestly, the suites are all about the same."
66167,L360675,u1952,m127,RICKY,Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
66168,L360674,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,All the suites are about the same.
66169,L360673,u1952,m127,RICKY,Is it the good room?
66170,L360672,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"What, sir?"
66171,L360671,u1952,m127,RICKY,So?
66172,L360670,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"Thank you very much, sir."
66173,L360669,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah. Take it.
66174,L360668,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,Are you sure?
66175,L360667,u1952,m127,RICKY,Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
66176,L360666,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"Not on me, sir."
66177,L360665,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?"
66178,L360664,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,I can take you down there.
66179,L360663,u1952,m127,RICKY,Is it a good room?
66180,L360662,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"Yes, sir."
66181,L360661,u1952,m127,RICKY,Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
66182,L360660,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315."
66183,L360658,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you."
66184,L360657,u1952,m127,RICKY,What's 'incidentals?'
66185,L360656,u1938,m127,BELLMAN,"...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals."
66186,L360978,u1939,m127,BIANCA,Somebody's getting comfortable.
66187,L360977,u1952,m127,RICKY,Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
66188,L360956,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'"
66189,L360955,u1939,m127,BIANCA,What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
66190,L360954,u1952,m127,RICKY,"I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here."
66191,L360948,u1952,m127,RICKY,So you're models?
66192,L360947,u1939,m127,BIANCA,We're in Fashion.
66193,L360946,u1952,m127,RICKY,I don't get it. What do you do?
66194,L360944,u1939,m127,BIANCA,No.
66195,L360943,u1952,m127,RICKY,You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
66196,L360942,u1939,m127,BIANCA,Manhattan.
66197,L360941,u1952,m127,RICKY,"So, wait, you're from where?"
66198,L360993,u1939,m127,BIANCA,Come on. Let's go.
66199,L360992,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,We used to take baths together.
66200,L360991,u1939,m127,BIANCA,Oh no. What is it this time.
66201,L360972,u1939,m127,BIANCA,But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
66202,L360971,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,I know.
66203,L360970,u1939,m127,BIANCA,He's alright.
66204,L360969,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,"He's great, right. Is he great?"
66205,L360968,u1939,m127,BIANCA,I don't know. Do whatever you want.
66206,L360967,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,Should I fuck him?
66207,L360966,u1939,m127,BIANCA,He's okay.
66208,L360965,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,Is he cute?
66209,L360960,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,"I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me."
66210,L360959,u1939,m127,BIANCA,Holy shit.
66211,L360958,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,"Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room..."
66212,L360328,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
66213,L360327,u1956,m127,WENDY,Bullshit.
66214,L360326,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did."
66215,L360325,u1956,m127,WENDY,And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
66216,L360324,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
66217,L360321,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No more.
66218,L360320,u1956,m127,WENDY,"You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing."
66219,L360319,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Bullshit.
66220,L360318,u1956,m127,WENDY,"I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit."
66221,L360317,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
66222,L360316,u1956,m127,WENDY,What the fuck was that about?
66223,L361195,u1941,m127,CHLOE,I love you. Come home.
66224,L361194,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone."
66225,L361193,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
66226,L361192,u1941,m127,CHLOE,Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
66227,L361191,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What time is it there?
66228,L361190,u1941,m127,CHLOE,No.
66229,L361189,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Mommy's not home?
66230,L361188,u1941,m127,CHLOE,I don't know.
66231,L361187,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?"
66232,L361186,u1941,m127,CHLOE,Uncle Bobby?
66233,L361185,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Chloe?
66234,L361184,u1941,m127,CHLOE,Hello.
66235,L360515,u1941,m127,CHLOE,I want spaghettis.
66236,L360514,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti"
66237,L360513,u1941,m127,CHLOE,You're not my daddy.
66238,L360496,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
66239,L360495,u1941,m127,CHLOE,It's a poison arrow tree frog.
66240,L360491,u1941,m127,CHLOE,He's not doing it.
66241,L360490,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"What's wrong, baby?"
66242,L360476,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Show uncle Ricky what you made.
66243,L360475,u1941,m127,CHLOE,No.
66244,L360474,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
66245,L360473,u1941,m127,CHLOE,It's daytime.
66246,L360472,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"She's, uh, sleeping."
66247,L360471,u1941,m127,CHLOE,A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
66248,L360466,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?"
66249,L360465,u1941,m127,CHLOE,Ricky's not wearing one.
66250,L361271,u1948,m127,JESS,I want you to take her with you.
66251,L361270,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What'd you say?
66252,L361269,u1948,m127,JESS,Take her.
66253,L361268,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up."
66254,L361267,u1948,m127,JESS,Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
66255,L361266,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can."
66256,L361265,u1948,m127,JESS,"Goodbye, Bobby."
66257,L361264,u1940,m127,BOBBY,How could you let her see this?
66258,L361263,u1948,m127,JESS,I never promised you anything.
66259,L360543,u1948,m127,JESS,"Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again."
66260,L360542,u1940,m127,BOBBY,She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
66261,L360541,u1948,m127,JESS,"Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is."
66262,L360540,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Max offered to stake me.
66263,L360539,u1948,m127,JESS,With what?
66264,L360538,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'll support you.
66265,L360537,u1948,m127,JESS,Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
66266,L360536,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I want you to quit.
66267,L360535,u1948,m127,JESS,"Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay."
66268,L360534,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
66269,L360533,u1948,m127,JESS,Shhh. He'll hear you.
66270,L360532,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
66271,L360531,u1948,m127,JESS,Ho's a good guy --
66272,L360530,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
66273,L360529,u1948,m127,JESS,"Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl."
66274,L360528,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No way that cocksucker's driving you.
66275,L360512,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Go.
66276,L360511,u1948,m127,JESS,Yeah? You sure?
66277,L360510,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
66278,L360283,u1948,m127,JESS,Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
66279,L360282,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No coke tonight.  Right?
66280,L360281,u1948,m127,JESS,Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
66281,L360280,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
66282,L360279,u1948,m127,JESS,You shouldn't. He likes you.
66283,L360278,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I feel weird asking him.
66284,L360277,u1948,m127,JESS,"Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself."
66285,L360276,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Well, that's not gonna happen."
66286,L360275,u1948,m127,JESS,The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
66287,L360274,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --"
66288,L360273,u1948,m127,JESS,I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
66289,L360272,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You talk to Max today?
66290,L360267,u1940,m127,BOBBY,They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
66291,L360266,u1948,m127,JESS,Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
66292,L360265,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'm ready.
66293,L360264,u1948,m127,JESS,She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
66294,L360263,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Who's watching the baby?
66295,L360262,u1948,m127,JESS,"Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late."
66296,L360261,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around."
66297,L360260,u1948,m127,JESS,"Oh, please."
66298,L360259,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
66299,L360258,u1948,m127,JESS,They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
66300,L360257,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
66301,L360256,u1948,m127,JESS,"Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money."
66302,L360255,u1940,m127,BOBBY,A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
66303,L360254,u1948,m127,JESS,Oh my god. What happened?
66304,L360253,u1948,m127,JESS,The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
66305,L360252,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No. What kind of bachelor party?
66306,L360251,u1948,m127,JESS,Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
66307,L360250,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"So, what kind of gig is this?"
66308,L360249,u1948,m127,JESS,Where were you?
66309,L360248,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Honey?
66310,L361262,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't get it.
66311,L361261,u1946,m127,HORNY GUY,I -- I -- I... Don't...
66312,L360313,u1946,m127,HORNY GUY,"Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --"
66313,L360312,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Your dance is over.
66314,L360311,u1946,m127,HORNY GUY,"Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?"
66315,L360310,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Get your hands off of her.
66316,L360309,u1946,m127,HORNY GUY,"Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --"
66317,L360308,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I said no touching.
66318,L360306,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
66319,L360305,u1946,m127,HORNY GUY,But what about them?
66320,L360304,u1940,m127,BOBBY,There's no touching.
66321,L360303,u1946,m127,HORNY GUY,Whu --
66322,L361212,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with."
66323,L361211,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where's Ricky.
66324,L361210,u1947,m127,HORRACE,This is it.
66325,L361209,u1947,m127,HORRACE,That's it.
66326,L361208,u1940,m127,BOBBY,That it?
66327,L361207,u1947,m127,HORRACE,He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
66328,L361206,u1940,m127,BOBBY,How so?
66329,L361205,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Ricky's taken care of.
66330,L361204,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where's Ricky?
66331,L361203,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Quick drop. In and out.
66332,L361202,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where we going?
66333,L361182,u1947,m127,HORRACE,And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
66334,L361181,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives."
66335,L361180,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case."
66336,L361179,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Heard of them.
66337,L361176,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants."
66338,L361175,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Ruiz tied in out there?
66339,L361174,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it."
66340,L361173,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What do you mean 'troughed?'
66341,L361172,u1947,m127,HORRACE,He must have that shit troughed.
66342,L361171,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah?
66343,L361170,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Brooklyn.
66344,L361169,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No.
66345,L361168,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?"
66346,L361067,u1947,m127,HORRACE,We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
66347,L361066,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where is this happening?
66348,L361065,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California."
66349,L361064,u1940,m127,BOBBY,So what do we do?
66350,L361059,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah.
66351,L361058,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit."
66352,L361057,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What's that?
66353,L361056,u1947,m127,HORRACE,This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
66354,L361055,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Why isn't Ruiz coming?
66355,L360917,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Shit.
66356,L360916,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?"
66357,L360915,u1940,m127,BOBBY,When's it going down?
66358,L360914,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing."
66359,L360913,u1940,m127,BOBBY,How bad is it?
66360,L360880,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now."
66361,L360879,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"So, when's the drop."
66362,L360878,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
66363,L360877,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What's his name?
66364,L360876,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy."
66365,L360875,u1940,m127,BOBBY,He making the drop?
66366,L360776,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah. Where is he?
66367,L360775,u1947,m127,HORRACE,What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
66368,L360546,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Excuse --
66369,L360545,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Get away from her.
66370,L360544,u1947,m127,HORRACE,C'mon girl. Eat up.
66371,L360521,u1940,m127,BOBBY,She'll be out in a minute.
66372,L360520,u1947,m127,HORRACE,Yeah.
66373,L360519,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You driving her?
66374,L360518,u1947,m127,HORRACE,What's up? Jess ready?
66375,L360302,u1947,m127,HORRACE,I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
66376,L360301,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Yeah, sure."
66377,L360300,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money."
66378,L360299,u1940,m127,BOBBY,5-5-1.
66379,L360298,u1947,m127,HORRACE,What's your record at?
66380,L360297,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Draw.
66381,L360296,u1947,m127,HORRACE,"Well, you look it. You win?"
66382,L360295,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
66383,L360294,u1947,m127,HORRACE,It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
66384,L361252,u1951,m127,MAX,"I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --"
66385,L361251,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
66386,L361250,u1951,m127,MAX,Take a few days --
66387,L361249,u1940,m127,BOBBY,There won't be a next thing.
66388,L360583,u1951,m127,MAX,Yes. Goodbye.
66389,L360582,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked."
66390,L360581,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --"
66391,L360574,u1951,m127,MAX,Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
66392,L360573,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You want --
66393,L360572,u1951,m127,MAX,What is it?
66394,L360571,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yes.
66395,L360563,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah.
66396,L360562,u1951,m127,MAX,"Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?"
66397,L360421,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No. Okay. I'll think about it.
66398,L360420,u1951,m127,MAX,Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
66399,L360419,u1940,m127,BOBBY,It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
66400,L360418,u1951,m127,MAX,"You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished."
66401,L360417,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess..."
66402,L360416,u1951,m127,MAX,"How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in."
66403,L360415,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah. Sure.
66404,L360414,u1951,m127,MAX,You vouch for him?
66405,L360413,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear."
66406,L360412,u1951,m127,MAX,"I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me."
66407,L360411,u1940,m127,BOBBY,He'll work it off.
66408,L360410,u1951,m127,MAX,That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
66409,L360409,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You told him you liked him.
66410,L360408,u1951,m127,MAX,Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
66411,L360407,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
66412,L360406,u1951,m127,MAX,"Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth."
66413,L360405,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Ruiz knows about this?
66414,L360404,u1951,m127,MAX,We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
66415,L360403,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah.
66416,L360402,u1951,m127,MAX,I got a way we make everybody happy.
66417,L360401,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah. Sorry.
66418,L360400,u1951,m127,MAX,Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
66419,L360399,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I know.
66420,L360398,u1951,m127,MAX,"Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom."
66421,L360397,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No.
66422,L360396,u1951,m127,MAX,Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
66423,L360395,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --"
66424,L360394,u1951,m127,MAX,"It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you."
66425,L360393,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't understand.
66426,L360392,u1951,m127,MAX,Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
66427,L360391,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Then what are you saying?
66428,L360390,u1951,m127,MAX,I didn't say that.
66429,L360389,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"So, that's it. I'm out?"
66430,L360388,u1951,m127,MAX,"You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul."
66431,L360387,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What?
66432,L360386,u1951,m127,MAX,"Not driving Jess, you won't."
66433,L360385,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'll work it off.
66434,L360384,u1951,m127,MAX,"Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand."
66435,L360383,u1940,m127,BOBBY,That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
66436,L360382,u1951,m127,MAX,They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
66437,L360381,u1940,m127,BOBBY,They were out of line --
66438,L360380,u1951,m127,MAX,"Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys."
66439,L360379,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line."
66440,L360378,u1951,m127,MAX,"I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?"
66441,L360377,u1940,m127,BOBBY,That's why they call it the smart money.
66442,L360376,u1951,m127,MAX,"Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast."
66443,L360375,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"She was fast, huh?"
66444,L360374,u1951,m127,MAX,A million. Easy.
66445,L360373,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Pshhh...
66446,L360372,u1951,m127,MAX,"Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?"
66447,L360371,u1940,m127,BOBBY,This one?
66448,L360370,u1951,m127,MAX,It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
66449,L360369,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Why?
66450,L360368,u1951,m127,MAX,Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
66451,L360367,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Me? No. Not really.
66452,L360366,u1951,m127,MAX,You bet the ponies?
66453,L360365,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Sure. Yeah.
66454,L360364,u1951,m127,MAX,You like the ponies?
66455,L361050,u1953,m127,RUIZ,You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
66456,L361049,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where's the drop?
66457,L361048,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight."
66458,L361041,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Tom, the Welsh dude --"
66459,L361040,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What's the plan?
66460,L361033,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it."
66461,L361032,u1940,m127,BOBBY,A bad heart.
66462,L361028,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Nah, man..."
66463,L361027,u1953,m127,RUIZ,Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
66464,L361021,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Good morning.
66465,L361020,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house."
66466,L360908,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears."
66467,L360907,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We get it. We're sorry.
66468,L360906,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?."
66469,L360867,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What drill?
66470,L360866,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?"
66471,L361200,u1949,m127,JIMMY,"Yeah, he's getting there on his own."
66472,L361199,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Taken care of?
66473,L361198,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Ricky's taken care of.
66474,L361197,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
66475,L360824,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah.
66476,L360823,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Understand me?
66477,L360822,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah?
66478,L360821,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
66479,L360820,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?"
66480,L360817,u1949,m127,JIMMY,"You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?"
66481,L360816,u1940,m127,BOBBY,'Trustafarians?'
66482,L360813,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Depends what night.
66483,L360812,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah.
66484,L360811,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Spa?
66485,L360744,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"No. That's cool, man."
66486,L360743,u1949,m127,JIMMY,I can wait around if you want.
66487,L360742,u1949,m127,JIMMY,"Well, this is the corner."
66488,L360741,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No. Just the cross streets.
66489,L360740,u1949,m127,JIMMY,You don't know where you're going?
66490,L360739,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?"
66491,L360738,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
66492,L360737,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?"
66493,L360655,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Soho.
66494,L360654,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where is the Soho Grand?
66495,L360636,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Traveling light. I like that.
66496,L360635,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Nah.
66497,L360634,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
66498,L360633,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
66499,L360632,u1949,m127,JIMMY,"You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?"
66500,L360631,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What's that?
66501,L360628,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Bobby.
66502,L360627,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Hi. I'm Jimmy.
66503,L360626,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Hi. I, uh, think that's us."
66504,L360732,u1945,m127,HISPANIC KID,I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
66505,L360731,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Listen, man, we really gotta..."
66506,L360730,u1945,m127,HISPANIC KID,"So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?"
66507,L360729,u1940,m127,BOBBY,It's important.
66508,L360728,u1945,m127,HISPANIC KID,I'm on the phone.
66509,L360727,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Excuse me, we need to make a call."
66510,L360726,u1945,m127,HISPANIC KID,"Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu..."
66511,L360865,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Thanks.
66512,L360864,u1943,m127,DOORMAN,"Any time, bro."
66513,L360863,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
66514,L360862,u1943,m127,DOORMAN,"Sorry, man, but..."
66515,L360846,u1943,m127,DOORMAN,He's not here.
66516,L360845,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Can you check?
66517,L360844,u1943,m127,DOORMAN,"Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though."
66518,L360843,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
66519,L360842,u1943,m127,DOORMAN,Ruiz isn't here.
66520,L360841,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We're with Ruiz.
66521,L361259,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'll be a minute.
66522,L361258,u1952,m127,RICKY,No. I'll wait here.
66523,L361257,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
66524,L361256,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Dude, we were practically made..."
66525,L361242,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
66526,L361241,u1952,m127,RICKY,Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
66527,L361125,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Easy...
66528,L361124,u1952,m127,RICKY,Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
66529,L361121,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You're not getting a gun.
66530,L361120,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance."
66531,L361119,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where do you get this shit?
66532,L361118,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice..."
66533,L361117,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
66534,L361116,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better."
66535,L361115,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't want to take any more chances.
66536,L361114,u1952,m127,RICKY,Three and a half hours?
66537,L361113,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Let's just go now and wait.
66538,L361112,u1952,m127,RICKY,So what do we do?
66539,L361111,u1940,m127,BOBBY,How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
66540,L361110,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep."
66541,L361109,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"No more, man."
66542,L361108,u1952,m127,RICKY,It's gonna be fine.
66543,L361107,u1940,m127,BOBBY,This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
66544,L361106,u1952,m127,RICKY,I'm sorry...
66545,L361105,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
66546,L361104,u1952,m127,RICKY,This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
66547,L361103,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
66548,L361102,u1952,m127,RICKY,Calm down.
66549,L361101,u1940,m127,BOBBY,They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
66550,L361100,u1952,m127,RICKY,What about it?
66551,L361099,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
66552,L361098,u1952,m127,RICKY,You did?
66553,L361097,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
66554,L361096,u1952,m127,RICKY,You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
66555,L361095,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What happened to the fifteen hundred?
66556,L361094,u1952,m127,RICKY,Eighty five.
66557,L361093,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Eighty bucks?!?
66558,L361092,u1952,m127,RICKY,Eighty.
66559,L361091,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What do you have left?
66560,L361090,u1952,m127,RICKY,No.
66561,L361089,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You're out of money?
66562,L361088,u1952,m127,RICKY,You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
66563,L361087,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Why?
66564,L361086,u1952,m127,RICKY,Float me a hundred bucks.
66565,L361085,u1940,m127,BOBBY,It was six in the fucking morning.
66566,L361084,u1952,m127,RICKY,That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
66567,L361083,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?"
66568,L361082,u1952,m127,RICKY,Wanna bet?
66569,L361081,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You wouldn't even know where to get one.
66570,L361080,u1952,m127,RICKY,All the more reason.
66571,L361079,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
66572,L361078,u1952,m127,RICKY,I'm pretty sure we do.
66573,L361077,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We don't need guns.
66574,L361076,u1952,m127,RICKY,We need guns.
66575,L361075,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins."
66576,L361074,u1952,m127,RICKY,Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
66577,L361073,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Did you hear what he just said?
66578,L361072,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
66579,L361071,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
66580,L361070,u1952,m127,RICKY,The penguin house.
66581,L361069,u1940,m127,BOBBY,The what?
66582,L361068,u1952,m127,RICKY,Let's check out the penguins.
66583,L361047,u1952,m127,RICKY,I'm your soldier.
66584,L361046,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Let's do it.
66585,L361037,u1952,m127,RICKY,"You want us strapped, don't you?"
66586,L361036,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Nothing, man."
66587,L361017,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
66588,L361016,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?"
66589,L361015,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"I swear to God, I'll fucking puke."
66590,L361014,u1952,m127,RICKY,"C'mon, man..."
66591,L361013,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Put that shit out...
66592,L361012,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
66593,L361011,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --"
66594,L361010,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You gonna shank him in the shower?
66595,L361009,u1952,m127,RICKY,"I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked."
66596,L361008,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What are you doing.
66597,L361007,u1940,m127,BOBBY,It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
66598,L361006,u1952,m127,RICKY,Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
66599,L361005,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We're not getting whacked.
66600,L361004,u1952,m127,RICKY,We're getting whacked.
66601,L361003,u1940,m127,BOBBY,He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
66602,L361002,u1952,m127,RICKY,Where?
66603,L361001,u1940,m127,BOBBY,He wants to see us now.
66604,L361000,u1952,m127,RICKY,What's up?
66605,L360999,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye."
66606,L360996,u1952,m127,RICKY,She was jonesing for me.
66607,L360995,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What the fuck was that about?
66608,L360990,u1952,m127,RICKY,"I swear to God, I didn't do anything."
66609,L360989,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What the hell did you do?
66610,L360976,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English."
66611,L360975,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do."
66612,L360974,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What the fuck's going on?
66613,L360940,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'"
66614,L360939,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
66615,L360938,u1952,m127,RICKY,Look who's back? Want some champagne?
66616,L360936,u1952,m127,RICKY,Fine.
66617,L360935,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
66618,L360934,u1952,m127,RICKY,You got that right.
66619,L360933,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
66620,L360932,u1952,m127,RICKY,Work's over. I'm gonna party.
66621,L360931,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You fucking nuts?
66622,L360930,u1952,m127,RICKY,Back in.
66623,L360929,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Where do you think you're going?
66624,L360928,u1952,m127,RICKY,Fuck this.
66625,L360927,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop."
66626,L360926,u1952,m127,RICKY,You too?
66627,L360925,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Why you gotta make everything difficult?
66628,L360924,u1952,m127,RICKY,About what?
66629,L360923,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You happy?
66630,L360871,u1952,m127,RICKY,So we're working?
66631,L360870,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah.
66632,L360828,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You would think.
66633,L360827,u1952,m127,RICKY,He woulda told us right?
66634,L360826,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Like I said, I don't know."
66635,L360825,u1952,m127,RICKY,So is this the drop?
66636,L360810,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?"
66637,L360809,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas..."
66638,L360808,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
66639,L360807,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah. What vibe?
66640,L360806,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What did I 'get?'
66641,L360805,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?"
66642,L360804,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Missing what? He didn't say shit.
66643,L360803,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it."
66644,L360802,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't know.
66645,L360801,u1952,m127,RICKY,This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
66646,L360774,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade."
66647,L360773,u1952,m127,RICKY,You know this guy?
66648,L360771,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You got something to say --
66649,L360770,u1952,m127,RICKY,"I mean, that's what I heard --"
66650,L360769,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What the fuck is that supposed --
66651,L360768,u1952,m127,RICKY,"You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?"
66652,L360767,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"You just don't fucking get it, do you?"
66653,L360766,u1952,m127,RICKY,Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
66654,L360765,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
66655,L360764,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy."
66656,L360763,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Motherfucker...
66657,L360762,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Sold it, stole it, whatever..."
66658,L360761,u1940,m127,BOBBY,You sold it? I thought they stole it.
66659,L360760,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van."
66660,L360759,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are."
66661,L360758,u1952,m127,RICKY,Don't even start.
66662,L360757,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What the fuck do you have to complain about?
66663,L360756,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What the fuck do you...
66664,L360755,u1952,m127,RICKY,"This is bullshit, man."
66665,L360754,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner."
66666,L360753,u1952,m127,RICKY,So they said more than the address.
66667,L360752,u1940,m127,BOBBY,They asked who it was.
66668,L360751,u1952,m127,RICKY,How'd they know who you were?
66669,L360750,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Nothing.
66670,L360749,u1952,m127,RICKY,Nothing else.
66671,L360748,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I told you what they said.
66672,L360747,u1952,m127,RICKY,They didn't say an address?
66673,L360746,u1940,m127,BOBBY,They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
66674,L360745,u1952,m127,RICKY,What exactly did they say?
66675,L360735,u1952,m127,RICKY,Fuck...
66676,L360734,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
66677,L360720,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Well, I don't want to walk."
66678,L360719,u1940,m127,BOBBY,It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
66679,L360718,u1952,m127,RICKY,You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
66680,L360717,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
66681,L360716,u1952,m127,RICKY,As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
66682,L360715,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I know you're not calling Jimmy.
66683,L360714,u1952,m127,RICKY,What are you doing?
66684,L360713,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What are you doing?
66685,L360712,u1952,m127,RICKY,Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
66686,L360711,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
66687,L360710,u1952,m127,RICKY,"We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit."
66688,L360709,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Oh really. Why's that?
66689,L360708,u1952,m127,RICKY,"But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already."
66690,L360707,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
66691,L360706,u1952,m127,RICKY,Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
66692,L360705,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last."
66693,L360704,u1952,m127,RICKY,Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
66694,L360703,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Great. On my fucking room.
66695,L360702,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Yeah, I guess."
66696,L360701,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Jesus, man. Plus ten?"
66697,L360700,u1952,m127,RICKY,Forty-six.
66698,L360699,u1940,m127,BOBBY,How much was it?
66699,L360698,u1952,m127,RICKY,How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
66700,L360697,u1940,m127,BOBBY,How much is it?
66701,L360696,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool."
66702,L360695,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"C'mon, man..."
66703,L360694,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Shhh... Hello, room service?"
66704,L360693,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Who you calling?
66705,L360625,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
66706,L360624,u1952,m127,RICKY,You sure?
66707,L360623,u1940,m127,BOBBY,'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
66708,L360622,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No. Look. There.
66709,L360621,u1952,m127,RICKY,Maybe we should call for a cab.
66710,L360620,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
66711,L360611,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Oh, I'll represent alright."
66712,L360610,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
66713,L360609,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours."
66714,L360608,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
66715,L360607,u1952,m127,RICKY,You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
66716,L360591,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Nah, don't bother --"
66717,L360590,u1952,m127,RICKY,I'll get the girl.
66718,L360589,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What's the movie?
66719,L360588,u1952,m127,RICKY,"See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets."
66720,L360587,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Pretty nice.
66721,L360586,u1952,m127,RICKY,Holy shit. Can you believe this?
66722,L360561,u1952,m127,RICKY,To keep?
66723,L360560,u1940,m127,BOBBY,It's ours.
66724,L360504,u1952,m127,RICKY,She really liked the kitchen.
66725,L360503,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Is that the woman from..?
66726,L360502,u1952,m127,RICKY,Right here's fine.
66727,L360501,u1952,m127,RICKY,This paint sucks. The white shows through.
66728,L360500,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I don't know.
66729,L360499,u1952,m127,RICKY,Who's driving her?
66730,L360498,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
66731,L360494,u1952,m127,RICKY,"I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple."
66732,L360493,u1940,m127,BOBBY,She wants you to paint the ashtray.
66733,L360492,u1952,m127,RICKY,What? Did she say something?
66734,L360482,u1952,m127,RICKY,Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
66735,L360481,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'm not taking her to a bar.
66736,L360480,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's."
66737,L360479,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I promised Chloe we'd come here.
66738,L360478,u1952,m127,RICKY,Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
66739,L360470,u1940,m127,BOBBY,See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
66740,L360469,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?"
66741,L360468,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket."
66742,L360467,u1952,m127,RICKY,"No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --"
66743,L360464,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Seat belt.
66744,L360463,u1952,m127,RICKY,I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
66745,L360462,u1940,m127,BOBBY,How'd you unlock my phone?
66746,L360461,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four."
66747,L360460,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Nice work.
66748,L360459,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I like it.
66749,L360458,u1952,m127,RICKY,It's not even yours.
66750,L360457,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I like it.
66751,L360456,u1952,m127,RICKY,Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
66752,L360455,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I gotta pick up the baby.
66753,L360454,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass."
66754,L360453,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
66755,L360452,u1952,m127,RICKY,Who is this fucking Ruiz?
66756,L360451,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business."
66757,L360450,u1952,m127,RICKY,What are we delivering?
66758,L360449,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus."
66759,L360448,u1952,m127,RICKY,Fuck him.
66760,L360447,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
66761,L360446,u1952,m127,RICKY,We'll kill Fairfax this year.

66767,L360434,u1952,m127,RICKY,Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
66768,L360433,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Bullshit...
66769,L360432,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --"
66770,L360431,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
66771,L360430,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in."
66772,L360429,u1940,m127,BOBBY,No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
66773,L360428,u1952,m127,RICKY,This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
66774,L360427,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job."
66775,L360426,u1952,m127,RICKY,He implied it.
66776,L360425,u1940,m127,BOBBY,He didn't say we need guns.
66777,L360424,u1952,m127,RICKY,I think we might.
66778,L360423,u1940,m127,BOBBY,We don't need guns.
66779,L360422,u1952,m127,RICKY,We need guns.
66780,L360346,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early..."
66781,L360345,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Come on, man. Not with the owners here."
66782,L360335,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Shhh...
66783,L360334,u1952,m127,RICKY,Fuck them.
66784,L360333,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Then why do you try to get in?
66785,L360332,u1952,m127,RICKY,I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
66786,L360331,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I thought you hate that club.
66787,L360330,u1952,m127,RICKY,"So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'"
66788,L360247,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Bye.
66789,L360246,u1952,m127,RICKY,I'll page you with the number.
66790,L360245,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I will.
66791,L360244,u1952,m127,RICKY,Ask if he said anything to her.
66792,L360243,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I got no idea.
66793,L360242,u1952,m127,RICKY,I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
66794,L360241,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I know the number.
66795,L360240,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number."
66796,L360239,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Yeah. I know the number.
66797,L360238,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
66798,L360237,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'll page you.
66799,L360236,u1952,m127,RICKY,Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
66800,L360235,u1940,m127,BOBBY,I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
66801,L360234,u1952,m127,RICKY,"I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us."
66802,L360233,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Don't be shitty.
66803,L360232,u1952,m127,RICKY,How am I being shitty?
66804,L360231,u1940,m127,BOBBY,Don't be shitty.
66805,L360230,u1952,m127,RICKY,That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
66806,L360229,u1940,m127,BOBBY,It's not losing record.
66807,L360228,u1952,m127,RICKY,"So, it's not a winning record."
66808,L360227,u1940,m127,BOBBY,"Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1."
66809,L360226,u1952,m127,RICKY,"So, it was a draw."
66810,L360225,u1940,m127,BOBBY,So?
66811,L360224,u1952,m127,RICKY,"You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max."
66812,L360223,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What are you saying?
66813,L360222,u1952,m127,RICKY,What about it?
66814,L360221,u1940,m127,BOBBY,What about boxing?
66815,L360220,u1952,m127,RICKY,Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
66816,L361166,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,Fuck...

66822,L361126,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,"Hey, boys."
66823,L360988,u1952,m127,RICKY,I didn't do anything --
66824,L360987,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,I want to leave right now.
66825,L360985,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,"I'm just warning you, I can't swim."
66826,L360984,u1952,m127,RICKY,You want to come splash around.
66827,L360982,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Well, come on then. It's back here."
66828,L360981,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,Yeah. I want it.
66829,L360980,u1952,m127,RICKY,You want your surprise?
66830,L360979,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,Where's the surprise?
66831,L360962,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,"That's a good idea, maybe I will!"
66832,L360961,u1952,m127,RICKY,"I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel."
66833,L360952,u1952,m127,RICKY,What do you mean 'kinda?'
66834,L360951,u1942,m127,CYNTHIA,Kinda. Yeah.

66956,L360647,u1949,m127,JIMMY,Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
66957,L360646,u1952,m127,RICKY,So whenever we want...
66958,L360642,u1949,m127,JIMMY,You'll love it.
66959,L360641,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah.
66960,L360640,u1949,m127,JIMMY,"You're from LA, right?"
66961,L360639,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah.
66962,L360638,u1949,m127,JIMMY,The Soho Grand?
66963,L360637,u1952,m127,RICKY,Is it nice?
66964,L360630,u1949,m127,JIMMY,"Soho Grand, right?"

66968,L360792,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Thanks, man. You need anything, you call."
66969,L360791,u1950,m127,LEO,We're square.
66970,L360790,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?"
66971,L360782,u1950,m127,LEO,Four fernet.
66972,L360781,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Yeah, bring us four fernet."
66973,L360780,u1950,m127,LEO,Sure. You boys want anything?
66974,L361248,u1951,m127,MAX,"And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing."
66975,L361247,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Yes, sir."
66976,L361246,u1951,m127,MAX,We're square.
66977,L361245,u1952,m127,RICKY,"But, Max --"
66978,L361244,u1951,m127,MAX,"I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van."
66979,L360585,u1951,m127,MAX,Goodbye.
66980,L360584,u1952,m127,RICKY,"So, wait, what are we dropping off?"
66981,L360580,u1951,m127,MAX,Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
66982,L360579,u1952,m127,RICKY,You want... Why are you picking on me?
66983,L360578,u1951,m127,MAX,So tell me how it is.
66984,L360577,u1952,m127,RICKY,Don't worry. I get it.
66985,L360576,u1951,m127,MAX,Tell me.
66986,L360575,u1952,m127,RICKY,I get it.
66987,L360570,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yes.
66988,L360569,u1951,m127,MAX,"You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?"
66989,L360568,u1952,m127,RICKY,What about my keys?
66990,L360567,u1951,m127,MAX,What?
66991,L360566,u1952,m127,RICKY,Keys.
66992,L360565,u1951,m127,MAX,"You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you."
66993,L360564,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah.
66994,L360559,u1952,m127,RICKY,And where do we bring it?
66995,L360558,u1951,m127,MAX,That money is your per diem.
66996,L360557,u1952,m127,RICKY,And the money. Where do we bring the money?
66997,L360556,u1951,m127,MAX,Yes. You're going to New York.
66998,L360555,u1952,m127,RICKY,We're going to New York?
66999,L360554,u1951,m127,MAX,"dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK."
67000,L360553,u1951,m127,MAX,Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
67001,L360552,u1952,m127,RICKY,Can I borrow a piece of --
67002,L361054,u1953,m127,RUIZ,That's none of your fucking business.
67003,L361053,u1952,m127,RICKY,"When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?"
67004,L361052,u1953,m127,RUIZ,What?
67005,L361051,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah.
67006,L361045,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down."
67007,L361044,u1952,m127,RICKY,"So, we're talking money laundering..."
67008,L361043,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account."
67009,L361042,u1952,m127,RICKY,The Red Dragon.
67010,L361035,u1953,m127,RUIZ,Outfit? What's he talking about?
67011,L361034,u1952,m127,RICKY,Who's gonna outfit us?
67012,L361031,u1952,m127,RICKY,He has a cute what...?
67013,L361030,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up."
67014,L361029,u1952,m127,RICKY,No...
67015,L360903,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?"
67016,L360902,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?"
67017,L360874,u1953,m127,RUIZ,Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
67018,L360873,u1952,m127,RICKY,She poured it for --
67019,L360872,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne."
67020,L360869,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?"
67021,L360868,u1952,m127,RICKY,We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
67022,L360787,u1952,m127,RICKY,It's a digestif.
67023,L360786,u1953,m127,RUIZ,Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
67024,L360785,u1952,m127,RICKY,Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
67025,L360784,u1953,m127,RUIZ,"What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?"
67026,L360783,u1952,m127,RICKY,No. I'll take a strega.
67027,L361145,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,Who's up for a night on the town.
67028,L361144,u1952,m127,RICKY,I'll get it.
67029,L361140,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,"Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know."
67030,L361139,u1952,m127,RICKY,Dip?
67031,L360899,u1952,m127,RICKY,A rose by any other name would --
67032,L360898,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,I am.
67033,L360897,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Well, word on the street is you're Welsh."
67034,L360896,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,Scotland.
67035,L360895,u1952,m127,RICKY,And where might that be?
67036,L360894,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,Edinburgh.
67037,L360893,u1952,m127,RICKY,"Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?"
67038,L360892,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,"Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom."
67039,L360891,u1952,m127,RICKY,"So, you must be the Red Dragon."
67040,L360890,u1955,m127,WELSHMAN,"And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?"
67041,L364677,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you."
67042,L364676,u1957,m128,ARCHIE,Yeah.
67043,L364675,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
67044,L364674,u1957,m128,ARCHIE,"No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks."
67045,L364673,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --"
67046,L364672,u1957,m128,ARCHIE,Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
67047,L364671,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
67048,L364670,u1957,m128,ARCHIE,"I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me."
67049,L364669,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah."
67050,L364668,u1957,m128,ARCHIE,"That really you, Red?"
67051,L364667,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Take it easy, baby."

67136,L364946,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?"
67137,L364945,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"""I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."""
67138,L364944,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
67139,L364685,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty."
67140,L364684,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?"
67141,L364590,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I want to. God knows I want to.
67142,L364589,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it."
67143,L364588,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I don't know how.
67144,L364587,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Tell Him that.
67145,L364586,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
67146,L364585,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?"
67147,L364584,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I don't know what to say to Allah.
67148,L364583,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,-- the hardest and the greatest.
67149,L364582,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I want to, Bembry, but I can't."
67150,L364581,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --"
67151,L364580,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I can't.
67152,L364579,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,-- the hardest and the greatest.
67153,L364578,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I want to, Bembry, but I can't."
67154,L364577,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --"
67155,L364576,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I can't.
67156,L364575,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission."
67157,L364574,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I will do it.
67158,L364573,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
67159,L364572,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women."
67160,L364571,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,The body is a holy repository.
67161,L364569,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"No. Elijah Muhammad does not say ""that white man is a devil."" He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men."
67162,L364568,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I sure met some.
67163,L364567,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
67164,L364566,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Then the devil is white.
67165,L364565,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --"
67166,L364563,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Who are you?
67167,L364562,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
67168,L364561,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
67169,L364560,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Little.
67170,L364557,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history."
67171,L364556,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,A black man playing big league ball is something.
67172,L364555,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years."
67173,L364547,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
67174,L364546,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"You pitch, baby; I'll ketch."
67175,L364545,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
67176,L364544,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood."
67177,L364535,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Read it and keep on reading.
67178,L364534,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens."
67179,L364533,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --"
67180,L364532,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Where am I gonna start?
67181,L364531,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
67182,L364530,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words."
67183,L364528,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?"
67184,L364527,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
67185,L364526,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Then what you telling me to study in them for?
67186,L364525,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
67187,L364524,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
67188,L364518,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability."
67189,L364517,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I can't make out that shit.
67190,L364513,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Okay, okay. Show me, man."
67191,L364512,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you."
67192,L364511,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"What the hell for, man?"
67193,L364510,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
67194,L364509,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What for?
67195,L364508,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?"
67196,L364507,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What? Everybody knows God is White.
67197,L364506,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black."
67198,L364505,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft."
67199,L364504,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog."
67200,L364503,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,That's what Mama used to say.
67201,L364502,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork."
67202,L364501,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What do you do with your time?
67203,L364500,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Don't con me.
67204,L364499,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Okay, okay."
67205,L364498,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Don't con me. Don't try...
67206,L364497,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
67207,L364496,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
67208,L364495,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"You the only cat don't come on with that ""Whatcha know, daddy"" jive; and you don't cuss none."
67209,L364494,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
67210,L364493,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
67211,L364492,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
67212,L364488,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
67213,L364487,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Elijah who?
67214,L364486,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light."
67215,L364484,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
67216,L364483,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Man, I don't want to hear all that."
67217,L364482,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white."
67218,L364480,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
67219,L364479,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Leggo. I got to wash it out.
67220,L364478,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I ain't said I'm ashamed.
67221,L364477,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
67222,L364476,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --"
67223,L364475,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Why? Why does everybody conk?
67224,L364474,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats."
67225,L364473,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Putting all that poison in your hair.
67226,L364472,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you."
67227,L364471,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,You ain't lying.
67228,L364467,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
67229,L364466,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What did you give it to me for then?
67230,L364465,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
67231,L364464,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?"
67232,L364463,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
67233,L364462,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?"
67234,L364460,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk."
67235,L364459,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,"You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some."
67236,L364458,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Man, what do you want?"
67237,L364457,u1958,m128,BEMBRY,Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
67238,L364456,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Who the hell are you?
67239,L364867,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact."
67240,L364866,u1959,m128,BENJAMIN,I'll have it tomorrow.
67241,L364797,u1959,m128,BENJAMIN,"Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar."
67242,L364796,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true."
67243,L364795,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
67244,L364794,u1959,m128,BENJAMIN,"Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you."
67245,L364793,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Do you?
67246,L364791,u1959,m128,BENJAMIN,"Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that."
67247,L364790,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What can I do for you?
67248,L365084,u1960,m128,BENJAMIN 2X,"And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --"
67249,L365083,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Make it plain.
67250,L365066,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
67251,L365065,u1960,m128,BENJAMIN 2X,"Next week, Brother Minister."
67252,L365064,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program."
67253,L365062,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister."
67254,L365061,u1960,m128,BENJAMIN 2X,"No, Brother Minister."
67255,L365060,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Is the program ready?
67256,L364875,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Come, sit with us."
67257,L364874,u1960,m128,BENJAMIN 2X,"All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister."
67258,L364873,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,You are now Benjamin 2X.
67259,L365047,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I don't think that's such a good idea.
67260,L365046,u1961,m128,BETTY,I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
67261,L365045,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
67262,L365044,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Dear heart, where are you?"
67263,L365043,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
67264,L365042,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?"
67265,L365041,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Betty it's me. It's me.
67266,L365040,u1961,m128,BETTY,Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
67267,L365011,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
67268,L365010,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Dear heart, I love you."
67269,L365009,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
67270,L365008,u1961,m128,BETTY,Shhh!
67271,L365007,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
67272,L365006,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,You have to sleep for three.
67273,L365005,u1961,m128,BETTY,Get some sleep.
67274,L364933,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us."
67275,L364932,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What do you want me to do?
67276,L364931,u1961,m128,BETTY,We need you too!
67277,L364930,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
67278,L364929,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?"
67279,L364928,u1961,m128,BETTY,Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
67280,L364927,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
67281,L364926,u1961,m128,BETTY,"What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance."
67282,L364925,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
67283,L364924,u1961,m128,BETTY,A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
67284,L364923,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
67285,L364922,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!"
67286,L364921,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
67287,L364920,u1961,m128,BETTY,"No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in ""Muhammad Speaks"" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own."
67288,L364919,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?"
67289,L364918,u1961,m128,BETTY,To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
67290,L364917,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
67291,L364916,u1961,m128,BETTY,"""Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."""
67292,L364915,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger."

67294,L364913,u1961,m128,BETTY,"We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more."
67295,L364912,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?"
67296,L364911,u1961,m128,BETTY,The talk is everywhere!
67297,L364910,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Talk about what?
67298,L364909,u1961,m128,BETTY,We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
67299,L364908,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I just want to sit here and be still.
67300,L364907,u1961,m128,BETTY,I'm not made of glass.
67301,L364906,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
67302,L364904,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,How do you know?
67303,L364903,u1961,m128,BETTY,Because you're in trouble.
67304,L364902,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Why are you looking at me like that?
67305,L364828,u1961,m128,BETTY,"The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you."
67306,L364827,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What do you think?
67307,L364826,u1961,m128,BETTY,"I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore."
67308,L364825,u1961,m128,BETTY,You're with me even when you're away.
67309,L364824,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'll be away a lot.
67310,L364823,u1961,m128,BETTY,Hush your mouth.
67311,L364822,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,It will be rough.
67312,L364821,u1961,m128,BETTY,Just hold me.
67313,L364820,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,It won't be easy.
67314,L364819,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I love you.
67315,L364818,u1961,m128,BETTY,Yes. Did you eat?
67316,L364817,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I think so. Can you catch a plane?
67317,L364816,u1961,m128,BETTY,Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
67318,L364815,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Did you hear what I said?
67319,L364814,u1961,m128,BETTY,Yes.
67320,L364813,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
67321,L364812,u1961,m128,BETTY,I know.
67322,L364811,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'm in Detroit.
67323,L364738,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife."
67324,L364737,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What have you set your mind to?
67325,L364736,u1961,m128,BETTY,And dogged when I set my mind to something.
67326,L364735,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Are you?
67327,L364734,u1961,m128,BETTY,"There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain."
67328,L364733,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"How old are you, Betty?"
67329,L364732,u1961,m128,BETTY,But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
67330,L364731,u1961,m128,BETTY,"If it's just idle, I won't answer it."
67331,L364730,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Just an idle question.
67332,L364729,u1961,m128,BETTY,Why do you ask?
67333,L364728,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?"
67334,L364727,u1961,m128,BETTY,You have enough worries of your own.
67335,L364726,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?"
67336,L364725,u1961,m128,BETTY,I can handle it.
67337,L364724,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family."
67338,L364723,u1961,m128,BETTY,Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
67339,L364722,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me."
67340,L364721,u1961,m128,BETTY,There's nothing to talk about.
67341,L364720,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Let's talk about you for a change.
67342,L364719,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Delicious.
67343,L364718,u1961,m128,BETTY,How do you like it?
67344,L364717,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
67345,L364716,u1961,m128,BETTY,What?
67346,L364715,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
67347,L364713,u1961,m128,BETTY,You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
67348,L364712,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
67349,L364711,u1961,m128,BETTY,Could we sit down someplace?
67350,L364710,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
67351,L364709,u1961,m128,BETTY,I see your point.
67352,L364705,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?"
67353,L364704,u1961,m128,BETTY,"Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork."
67354,L364701,u1961,m128,BETTY,That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
67355,L364700,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What points?
67356,L364697,u1961,m128,BETTY,Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
67357,L364696,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms."
67358,L364693,u1961,m128,BETTY,If you want to tell me.
67359,L364692,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
67360,L364690,u1961,m128,BETTY,She ate.
67361,L364689,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What?
67362,L365079,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,Down front as always.
67363,L365078,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Is my family here yet?
67364,L365077,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,Let's cancel.
67365,L365076,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for."
67366,L365075,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,"Brother Minister, what is wrong?"
67367,L365072,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What did I tell you about assuming?
67368,L365071,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,I assumed...
67369,L365070,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else."
67370,L365069,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,"I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?"
67371,L365068,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
67372,L365067,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
67373,L365038,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me."
67374,L365037,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
67375,L365036,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right."
67376,L365035,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,Let some of us come down there.
67377,L365034,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
67378,L365033,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,"Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city."
67379,L365032,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Brother Earl.
67380,L365025,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,Let's get out of this cold.
67381,L365024,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this."
67382,L364787,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"That's enough, Brother Earl."
67383,L364786,u1962,m128,BROTHER EARL,I'm tired of praying.
67384,L364785,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray."
67385,L364628,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black."
67386,L364627,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,Just what are you saying?
67387,L364626,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black."
67388,L364625,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,"Now just a moment, just a moment --"
67389,L364624,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Then we don't know that God was white.
67390,L364623,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,I told you we don't know for certain.
67391,L364622,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What color were the original Hebrews?
67392,L364621,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,Just what is your question?
67393,L364620,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
67394,L364619,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,That's right.
67395,L364618,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"They were Hebrew, weren't they?"
67396,L364617,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,I don't think we know for certain.
67397,L364616,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
67398,L364615,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,Why don't you just ask your question?
67399,L364450,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em."
67400,L364449,u1963,m128,CHAPLAIN GILL,"Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?"
67401,L364858,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, ""Let's go, let's separate"", he'd yell, ""Yeah, man, any place is better than this."" You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one."
67402,L364857,u1964,m128,DR. PAYSON,Let him finish.
67403,L364852,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger."
67404,L364851,u1964,m128,DR. PAYSON,Entirely.
67405,L364850,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: ""Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture."" Would you agree?"
67406,L364849,u1964,m128,DR. PAYSON,You put it very well.
67407,L364848,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Stop me if I'm wrong. I ""polarize the community."" I ""erroneously appraise the racial picture."""
67408,L364845,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, ""Do you hate me!"" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate."
67409,L364844,u1964,m128,DR. PAYSON,"Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?"
67410,L364843,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Please, go ahead."
67411,L364842,u1964,m128,DR. PAYSON,"Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?"
67412,L364957,u1965,m128,ELIJAH,"That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims."
67413,L364956,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Yes, sir, I did."
67414,L364955,u1965,m128,ELIJAH,Did you see the papers today?
67415,L364802,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Allah Akbar.
67416,L364801,u1965,m128,ELIJAH,"No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all."
67417,L364800,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Let me do it then.
67418,L364799,u1965,m128,ELIJAH,"If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility."
67419,L364695,u1965,m128,ELIJAH,Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
67420,L364694,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,If you want to tell me.
67421,L364899,u1966,m128,GREGORY,"If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you."
67422,L364898,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Say what you're saying.

67424,L364896,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What?

67426,L364894,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Sure, man."
67427,L364893,u1966,m128,GREGORY,Can I ask you something?
67428,L364298,u1967,m128,HONEY,"Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day."
67429,L364297,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Is she hooking?

67441,L364418,u1968,m128,JUDGE,The sentences to run concurrently.
67442,L364417,u1982,m128,VOICE OF MALCOLM X,Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.

67444,L364415,u1982,m128,VOICE OF MALCOLM X,But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.

67468,L364146,u1973,m128,MISS DUNNE,"I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness."
67469,L364145,u1970,m128,LOUISE,These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
67470,L364144,u1973,m128,MISS DUNNE,-- there is a serious question as to whether --

67476,L364969,u1979,m128,SIDNEY,Let me die then.
67477,L364968,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,No. You'll be marked for death.
67478,L364967,u1979,m128,SIDNEY,"I'm with you, Brother Minister."
67479,L364966,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What does Sidney say?
67480,L364965,u1979,m128,SIDNEY,"To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep."
67481,L364964,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What mission?
67482,L364963,u1979,m128,SIDNEY,"All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all."
67483,L364962,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,How long has this been going on?
67484,L364961,u1979,m128,SIDNEY,Another one?

67502,L364114,u1981,m128,SOPHIA,You the man.
67503,L364113,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"You hear me, girl?"

67507,L364092,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
67508,L364091,u1981,m128,SOPHIA,"That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run."
67509,L364090,u1981,m128,SOPHIA,...That isn't a whore?
67510,L364089,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty."
67511,L364659,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket."
67512,L364658,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
67513,L364657,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet."
67514,L364656,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty."
67515,L364655,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?"
67516,L364654,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
67517,L364653,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind."
67518,L364652,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us."
67519,L364651,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear."
67520,L364405,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts."
67521,L364404,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
67522,L364403,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Yeah.

67524,L364400,u1978,m128,SHORTY,You the man!
67525,L364399,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
67526,L364379,u1978,m128,SHORTY,Tell him about Baldy.
67527,L364378,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,That ain't bad.
67528,L364367,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
67529,L364366,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Jesus, Red, she's just a kid."
67530,L364365,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?"
67531,L364364,u1978,m128,SHORTY,I ain't doing bad.
67532,L364363,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?"
67533,L364102,u1978,m128,SHORTY,I'm not too short to be Cagney.
67534,L364101,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,You're too small to be Bogart.
67535,L364100,u1978,m128,SHORTY,I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
67536,L364099,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,The hell you are.
67537,L364098,u1978,m128,SHORTY,I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
67538,L364097,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size."
67539,L364096,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Bang, bang. You're dead."
67540,L364095,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Eat lead, coppers."
67541,L364094,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart."
67542,L364073,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
67543,L364072,u1978,m128,SHORTY,Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
67544,L364071,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Fine as May wine.

67546,L364067,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Shorty, this is Laura."
67547,L364066,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Hey, man, gimme some skin."
67548,L364049,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Well, all reet, then."
67549,L364048,u1978,m128,SHORTY,"Well, all right, then."
67550,L364398,u1976,m128,RUDY,"Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss."
67551,L364397,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?"
67552,L364390,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this."
67553,L364389,u1976,m128,RUDY,I'm the man.
67554,L364388,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Head nigger in charge?
67555,L364387,u1976,m128,RUDY,That's right.
67556,L364386,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,You want to be the head man?
67557,L364385,u1976,m128,RUDY,"Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?"
67558,L364384,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Might be all right.
67559,L364383,u1976,m128,RUDY,"So? The man got silver, china, rugs --"
67560,L364382,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,So what about him?
67561,L364381,u1976,m128,RUDY,Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
67562,L364375,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,What can you do?
67563,L364374,u1976,m128,RUDY,"I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one."
67564,L364768,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,"Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that."
67565,L364767,u1975,m128,PLAINCLOTHES,"Watch your tongue, boy."
67566,L364766,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Only a pig could do a thing like that.
67567,L364761,u1975,m128,PLAINCLOTHES,"Eddie, let's see that blotter."
67568,L364760,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Brothers of Brother Johnson.
67569,L364759,u1975,m128,PLAINCLOTHES,Who the hell are they?
67570,L364757,u1975,m128,PLAINCLOTHES,You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
67571,L364756,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
67572,L364942,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Allah will provide.
67573,L364941,u1980,m128,SISTER LUCILLE,"Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want."
67574,L364940,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,Are you sure?
67575,L364939,u1980,m128,SISTER LUCILLE,Yes sir.
67576,L364938,u1971,m128,MALCOLM,He told you that?
67577,L364937,u1980,m128,SISTER LUCILLE,"Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him."
67578,L364161,u1972,m128,MALCOLM'S VOICE,I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
67579,L364160,u1974,m128,MRS. SWERLIN,Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
67580,L364159,u1972,m128,MALCOLM'S VOICE,They talked about me like
67581,L364158,u1974,m128,MRS. SWERLIN,He's bright.
67582,L364157,u1972,m128,MALCOLM'S VOICE,I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
67583,L364156,u1972,m128,MALCOLM'S VOICE,I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
67584,L364155,u1974,m128,MRS. SWERLIN,"This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother."
67585,L364154,u1974,m128,MRS. SWERLIN,"This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean."
67586,L364153,u1972,m128,MALCOLM'S VOICE,"We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge."
67587,L367018,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been."
67588,L367017,u1991,m129,MANZANO,Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
67589,L367013,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'm not... easy.
67590,L367012,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"You have no interest in making things easy, do you?"
67591,L367011,u1983,m129,CREASY,Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
67592,L367010,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"No, but I have to admit I thought about it."
67593,L367009,u1983,m129,CREASY,My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
67594,L367008,u1991,m129,MANZANO,I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
67595,L367007,u1983,m129,CREASY,Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
67596,L367006,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want."
67597,L367005,u1983,m129,CREASY,So you are going to talk me to death.
67598,L367004,u1991,m129,MANZANO,My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
67599,L367003,u1983,m129,CREASY,Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
67600,L367002,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours."
67601,L367001,u1983,m129,CREASY,It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
67602,L367000,u1991,m129,MANZANO,My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
67603,L366998,u1991,m129,MANZANO,He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
67604,L366997,u1983,m129,CREASY,I don't know shit about you.
67605,L366996,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?"
67606,L366995,u1983,m129,CREASY,What do you want?
67607,L366994,u1991,m129,MANZANO,The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
67608,L366993,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico."
67609,L366992,u1983,m129,CREASY,It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
67610,L366991,u1991,m129,MANZANO,Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
67611,L366740,u1991,m129,MANZANO,All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
67612,L366739,u1983,m129,CREASY,Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
67613,L366738,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"No. It would be convenient, but no."
67614,L366737,u1983,m129,CREASY,Am I a suspect?
67615,L366736,u1991,m129,MANZANO,You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
67616,L366735,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
67617,L366734,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?"
67618,L366733,u1983,m129,CREASY,What am I doing here?
67619,L366230,u1983,m129,CREASY,[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
67620,L366229,u1985,m129,CUSTOMS,[Senor?]

67629,L366980,u1983,m129,CREASY,"I show, you give me the information?"
67630,L366979,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
67631,L366965,u1983,m129,CREASY,"You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you."
67632,L366964,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
67633,L366963,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos."
67634,L366883,u1983,m129,CREASY,Give me the address.
67635,L366882,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
67636,L366881,u1983,m129,CREASY,Where does he live?
67637,L366880,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
67638,L366879,u1983,m129,CREASY,What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
67639,L366878,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'll call you tomorrow.
67640,L366877,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,Where do I find you?
67641,L366875,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,I have connections.
67642,L366874,u1983,m129,CREASY,I need something. Do you have banking connections?
67643,L366784,u1983,m129,CREASY,Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.

67645,L366782,u1983,m129,CREASY,"I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches."
67646,L366781,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,So where do we begin?
67647,L366780,u1983,m129,CREASY,Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
67648,L366752,u1983,m129,CREASY,It's a little late.
67649,L366751,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
67650,L366749,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
67651,L366748,u1983,m129,CREASY,I guess that makes you the smart one.
67652,L366747,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,A lot of people are looking for you.

67666,L366854,u1987,m129,GUARDIAN TWO,"[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]"
67667,L366853,u1983,m129,CREASY,[What money?]
67668,L366851,u1987,m129,GUARDIAN TWO,[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]

67740,L366958,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
67741,L366957,u1983,m129,CREASY,[Maybe your men stole from you.]
67742,L366956,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
67743,L366955,u1983,m129,CREASY,[Don't lie to me!]
67744,L366954,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
67745,L366953,u1983,m129,CREASY,[The ransom was ten.]

67752,L366945,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,"[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]"
67753,L366944,u1983,m129,CREASY,[Lucky how?]
67754,L366943,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
67755,L366942,u1983,m129,CREASY,"[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]"
67756,L366941,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,"[Please, don't...]"
67757,L366938,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,[Correct!]
67758,L366937,u1983,m129,CREASY,[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
67759,L366936,u1998,m129,TAZINARI,[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
67760,L366300,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
67761,L366299,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
67762,L366298,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,And what if amateurs try it?
67763,L366297,u1983,m129,CREASY,"My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay."
67764,L366296,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,How does it affect you?
67765,L366295,u1983,m129,CREASY,I drink.
67766,L366294,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
67767,L366292,u1983,m129,CREASY,It's loaded.
67768,L366291,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Is it loaded?
67769,L366290,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Have you used this type before?
67770,L366289,u1983,m129,CREASY,Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
67771,L366288,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,What is it?
67772,L366287,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,"Show me, please."
67773,L366286,u1983,m129,CREASY,Yes.
67774,L366285,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Were you provided with a gun?
67775,L366779,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Different door. Not far from here.
67776,L366778,u1983,m129,CREASY,Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
67777,L366776,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us."
67778,L366775,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
67779,L366772,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
67780,L366771,u1983,m129,CREASY,Yes or no?
67781,L366770,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
67782,L366744,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
67783,L366743,u1983,m129,CREASY,Stomach's gone. But... okay.
67784,L366697,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
67785,L366696,u1983,m129,CREASY,Pinta...
67786,L366695,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
67787,L366598,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,I said the plan was right here.
67788,L366597,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?"
67789,L366447,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Sorry I woke you, Ray."
67790,L366446,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Creasy?
67791,L366444,u1983,m129,CREASY,Maybe...
67792,L366443,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
67793,L366442,u1983,m129,CREASY,I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
67794,L366441,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,You mean a misfire?
67795,L366395,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?"
67796,L366394,u1983,m129,CREASY,There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
67797,L366282,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not."
67798,L366281,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Oh, now you think I can be trusted."
67799,L366280,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
67800,L366279,u1983,m129,CREASY,A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
67801,L366278,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
67802,L366277,u1983,m129,CREASY,I came to visit you.
67803,L366276,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,What are you doing here?
67804,L366275,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
67805,L366274,u1983,m129,CREASY,A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
67806,L366273,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good."
67807,L366272,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
67808,L366271,u1983,m129,CREASY,"And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?"
67809,L366270,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"Well, you'd have to keep it under control."
67810,L366269,u1983,m129,CREASY,"You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?"
67811,L366268,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
67812,L366258,u1983,m129,CREASY,Everything happens once if you live long enough.
67813,L366257,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,You did something on impulse?
67814,L366256,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse."
67815,L366255,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"How long you staying, Crease?"
67816,L366254,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting."
67817,L366253,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,You been working?
67818,L366252,u1983,m129,CREASY,And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
67819,L366251,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"Oh, like you haven't been in worse places."
67820,L366250,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Yeah, right..."
67821,L366249,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here."
67822,L366248,u1983,m129,CREASY,But don't you stay in El Paso?
67823,L366247,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
67824,L366246,u1983,m129,CREASY,So how's business?
67825,L366245,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Don't give me that bullshit.
67826,L366244,u1983,m129,CREASY,Nothing wrong.
67827,L366243,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,So what's wrong?
67828,L366242,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"This is Mexico, they do everything backwards."
67829,L366241,u1983,m129,CREASY,It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
67830,L366240,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Everything happens once if you live long enough.
67831,L366239,u1983,m129,CREASY,Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
67832,L366238,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
67833,L366236,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
67834,L366235,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"What do you mean, I'm here?"
67835,L366234,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'm here.
67836,L366233,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
67837,L366232,u1983,m129,CREASY,When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
67838,L366651,u1983,m129,CREASY,You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
67839,L366650,u1992,m129,PINTA,You got that right.
67840,L366649,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, ""Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves."" New Testament, Romans 13."
67841,L366648,u1992,m129,PINTA,Dyslexic?
67842,L366647,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic."
67843,L366645,u1992,m129,PINTA,I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
67844,L366644,u1983,m129,CREASY,Be a swimmer.
67845,L366643,u1992,m129,PINTA,I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
67846,L366642,u1983,m129,CREASY,Then be trained.
67847,L366641,u1992,m129,PINTA,"There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained."
67848,L366640,u1983,m129,CREASY,Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
67849,L366639,u1992,m129,PINTA,"You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim."
67850,L366638,u1983,m129,CREASY,That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
67851,L366637,u1992,m129,PINTA,Frank. Frankie.
67852,L366636,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time."
67853,L366617,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough."
67854,L366616,u1992,m129,PINTA,You think too much?
67855,L366615,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears."
67856,L366614,u1992,m129,PINTA,"My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?"
67857,L366613,u1983,m129,CREASY,Still not a question.
67858,L366612,u1992,m129,PINTA,I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
67859,L366611,u1983,m129,CREASY,That's not a question.
67860,L366610,u1992,m129,PINTA,You don't drink like you used to.
67861,L366609,u1983,m129,CREASY,Could I stop you?
67862,L366608,u1992,m129,PINTA,Could I ask you a question?
67863,L366590,u1992,m129,PINTA,I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
67864,L366589,u1983,m129,CREASY,The blocks.
67865,L366584,u1992,m129,PINTA,Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
67866,L366583,u1983,m129,CREASY,Your father has business.
67867,L366582,u1992,m129,PINTA,What's so important in Los Angeles?
67868,L366578,u1983,m129,CREASY,There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
67869,L366577,u1992,m129,PINTA,"I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you."
67870,L366576,u1983,m129,CREASY,You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
67871,L366575,u1992,m129,PINTA,The gunshot holds no fear.
67872,L366574,u1983,m129,CREASY,The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
67873,L366571,u1992,m129,PINTA,Are you afraid of me?
67874,L366570,u1983,m129,CREASY,I know you're not.
67875,L366569,u1992,m129,PINTA,"I'm not afraid you, Creasy."
67876,L366566,u1992,m129,PINTA,It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
67877,L366565,u1983,m129,CREASY,I dropped her at home.
67878,L366564,u1992,m129,PINTA,Where's my mother?
67879,L366563,u1992,m129,PINTA,"You were never late before, I was worried."
67880,L366562,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'm sorry.
67881,L366561,u1992,m129,PINTA,You're late.
67882,L366554,u1983,m129,CREASY,Yeah. Two or three.
67883,L366553,u1992,m129,PINTA,Did you used to?
67884,L366552,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
67885,L366551,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?"
67886,L366550,u1983,m129,CREASY,I guess that really does make me a hard case.
67887,L366549,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me."
67888,L366548,u1983,m129,CREASY,Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
67889,L366547,u1992,m129,PINTA,Yes.
67890,L366546,u1983,m129,CREASY,Remember you asked me what state I was from?
67891,L366543,u1983,m129,CREASY,Don't worry. You will.
67892,L366542,u1992,m129,PINTA,I don't understand.
67893,L366541,u1983,m129,CREASY,You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
67894,L366538,u1983,m129,CREASY,"No, that was in Columbia."
67895,L366537,u1992,m129,PINTA,What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
67896,L366536,u1983,m129,CREASY,I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
67897,L366535,u1992,m129,PINTA,So how come you know so much about those countries?
67898,L366532,u1992,m129,PINTA,[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
67899,L366531,u1983,m129,CREASY,You feel sorry for the husband?
67900,L366530,u1992,m129,PINTA,It must be difficult having lots of wives.
67901,L366529,u1983,m129,CREASY,"In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules."
67902,L366528,u1992,m129,PINTA,But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
67903,L366527,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Well, it's a sort of wife."
67904,L366526,u1992,m129,PINTA,It was in a book at school. Concubine.
67905,L366525,u1983,m129,CREASY,Why do you ask?
67906,L366522,u1983,m129,CREASY,You need to practice.
67907,L366521,u1992,m129,PINTA,Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
67908,L366520,u1983,m129,CREASY,In a week you should be fine.
67909,L366519,u1992,m129,PINTA,It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
67910,L366518,u1983,m129,CREASY,How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
67911,L366517,u1992,m129,PINTA,Yes.
67912,L366516,u1983,m129,CREASY,Did you sleep alright?
67913,L366509,u1983,m129,CREASY,I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
67914,L366508,u1992,m129,PINTA,I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
67915,L366507,u1983,m129,CREASY,Do you always sleep with him?
67916,L366506,u1983,m129,CREASY,White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
67917,L366505,u1992,m129,PINTA,"The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?"
67918,L366498,u1992,m129,PINTA,My ankle.
67919,L366497,u1983,m129,CREASY,I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
67920,L366496,u1992,m129,PINTA,Everywhere!
67921,L366495,u1983,m129,CREASY,Where?
67922,L366494,u1992,m129,PINTA,It hurts.
67923,L366488,u1992,m129,PINTA,They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
67924,L366487,u1983,m129,CREASY,They'll be back in a week.
67925,L366481,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy."
67926,L366480,u1992,m129,PINTA,"It's better to be free, right?"
67927,L366479,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Well, I let him go."
67928,L366478,u1992,m129,PINTA,How do you think he got out?
67929,L366477,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
67930,L366476,u1992,m129,PINTA,Maybe. Did you hear him?
67931,L366475,u1983,m129,CREASY,Do you think he'll come back?
67932,L366474,u1992,m129,PINTA,Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
67933,L366473,u1983,m129,CREASY,What are you doing?
67934,L366471,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late."
67935,L366470,u1983,m129,CREASY,You're fast.
67936,L366449,u1992,m129,PINTA,"I go to school, don't I?"
67937,L366448,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Pinta, do you have a pencil?"
67938,L366414,u1992,m129,PINTA,I'm not crying.
67939,L366413,u1983,m129,CREASY,And don't start crying.
67940,L366408,u1992,m129,PINTA,Oh...
67941,L366407,u1983,m129,CREASY,Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
67942,L366406,u1992,m129,PINTA,So you were unhappy?
67943,L366405,u1983,m129,CREASY,It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
67944,L366404,u1992,m129,PINTA,Hmmm?
67945,L366403,u1992,m129,PINTA,But why not?
67946,L366402,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
67947,L366401,u1992,m129,PINTA,Not at all?
67948,L366400,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
67949,L366399,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Did you like school, Creasy?"
67950,L366397,u1983,m129,CREASY,That's right.
67951,L366396,u1992,m129,PINTA,We're taking a different way home.
67952,L366372,u1983,m129,CREASY,Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
67953,L366371,u1992,m129,PINTA,"There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?"
67954,L366370,u1983,m129,CREASY,Time will tell.
67955,L366369,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?"
67956,L366368,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'm a bargain.
67957,L366367,u1992,m129,PINTA,Someone gave him more money than we could.
67958,L366366,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?"
67959,L366365,u1992,m129,PINTA,Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
67960,L366364,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking."
67961,L366363,u1992,m129,PINTA,Potential? I don't understand.
67962,L366362,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'm looking for potential.
67963,L366361,u1992,m129,PINTA,Why not?
67964,L366360,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
67965,L366359,u1992,m129,PINTA,"You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?"
67966,L366358,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
67967,L366355,u1992,m129,PINTA,I know. But which state?
67968,L366354,u1983,m129,CREASY,The United States.
67969,L366353,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Where are you from, Creasy?"
67970,L366338,u1992,m129,PINTA,Creasy...
67971,L366337,u1983,m129,CREASY,Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
67972,L366336,u1992,m129,PINTA,"In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?"
67973,L366334,u1992,m129,PINTA,My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
67974,L366333,u1983,m129,CREASY,Who's Emilio?
67975,L366332,u1992,m129,PINTA,That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
67976,L366329,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside."
67977,L366328,u1983,m129,CREASY,Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
67978,L366327,u1992,m129,PINTA,Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
67979,L366326,u1983,m129,CREASY,If they like me.
67980,L366325,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?"
67981,L367069,u1983,m129,CREASY,"Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back."
67982,L367068,u1990,m129,LISA,Creasy... Wait.
67983,L367067,u1983,m129,CREASY,Then don't come.
67984,L367066,u1990,m129,LISA,You're lying. I don't believe you.
67985,L367065,u1983,m129,CREASY,I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
67986,L367064,u1990,m129,LISA,I don't believe you.
67987,L366971,u1983,m129,CREASY,An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
67988,L366970,u1990,m129,LISA,Planned what?
67989,L366969,u1983,m129,CREASY,"They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus."
67990,L366758,u1983,m129,CREASY,Because...  I was already dead.
67991,L366757,u1990,m129,LISA,Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
67992,L366466,u1983,m129,CREASY,"If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier."
67993,L366465,u1990,m129,LISA,Jordan!
67994,L366452,u1990,m129,LISA,The traffic takes some getting used to.
67995,L366451,u1983,m129,CREASY,Sorry.
67996,L366435,u1990,m129,LISA,"Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends."
67997,L366434,u1983,m129,CREASY,"It is serious, Mrs. Ramos."
67998,L366433,u1990,m129,LISA,It makes it all seem so serious.
67999,L366431,u1990,m129,LISA,"No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that."
68000,L366430,u1983,m129,CREASY,Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
68001,L366429,u1983,m129,CREASY,"You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?"
68002,L366428,u1990,m129,LISA,You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
68003,L366427,u1983,m129,CREASY,No.
68004,L366426,u1990,m129,LISA,"Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?"
68005,L366425,u1983,m129,CREASY,We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
68006,L366424,u1990,m129,LISA,How are you getting along with Pinta?
68007,L366423,u1990,m129,LISA,It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
68008,L366422,u1983,m129,CREASY,The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
68009,L366421,u1990,m129,LISA,Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
68010,L366420,u1983,m129,CREASY,I'm fine.
68011,L366419,u1990,m129,LISA,"Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need."
68012,L366310,u1983,m129,CREASY,Never.
68013,L366309,u1990,m129,LISA,You've done much of this work before?
68014,L366304,u1983,m129,CREASY,So are you.
68015,L366303,u1990,m129,LISA,You're American.
68016,L366302,u1983,m129,CREASY,It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
68017,L366301,u1990,m129,LISA,The world of our children. How dare they?
68018,L366871,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,Camila. Camila Valencias.
68019,L366870,u1984,m129,CREASY'S VOICE,What was her name?
68020,L366869,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,Last night. Do you know something?
68021,L366868,u1984,m129,CREASY'S VOICE,Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
68022,L366867,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,Where are you?
68023,L366866,u1984,m129,CREASY'S VOICE,It's Creasy.
68024,L366865,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,Rosanna Guerrero.
68025,L366221,u1988,m129,JORDAN,She understands men.
68026,L366220,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,For an American she understands this country very well.
68027,L366219,u1988,m129,JORDAN,Her beauty fucks with your mind.
68028,L366218,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
68029,L366217,u1988,m129,JORDAN,For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
68030,L366216,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,For a year?
68031,L366215,u1988,m129,JORDAN,"You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?"
68032,L366214,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
68033,L366213,u1988,m129,JORDAN,I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
68034,L366212,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,"I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it."
68035,L366211,u1988,m129,JORDAN,All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
68036,L366210,u1988,m129,JORDAN,Yeah? And if she was ugly?
68037,L366209,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
68038,L366201,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Do you know what she told me last night?
68039,L366200,u1988,m129,JORDAN,"If she pisses you off, you get another one."
68040,L366199,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
68041,L366198,u1988,m129,JORDAN,The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
68042,L366707,u1999,m129,VOICE,[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
68043,L366706,u1988,m129,JORDAN,[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
68044,L366705,u1999,m129,VOICE,[No. Why?]
68045,L366704,u1988,m129,JORDAN,"[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]"
68046,L366703,u1999,m129,VOICE,[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
68047,L366702,u1988,m129,JORDAN,"[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]"
68048,L366701,u1999,m129,VOICE,"[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]"
68049,L366700,u1988,m129,JORDAN,[Yes.]
68050,L366699,u1999,m129,VOICE,[You have the money.]
68051,L366485,u1992,m129,PINTA,You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
68052,L366484,u1990,m129,LISA,"I'll call you from Detroit, baby."
68053,L366454,u1990,m129,LISA,Don't forget your towel.
68054,L366453,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Bye, Mom."
68055,L366346,u1990,m129,LISA,"Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby."
68056,L366345,u1992,m129,PINTA,"I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick."
68057,L366343,u1992,m129,PINTA,He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
68058,L366342,u1990,m129,LISA,You do?
68059,L366341,u1992,m129,PINTA,"I like him, Mom."
68060,L366318,u1990,m129,LISA,This is Mr. Creasy.
68061,L366317,u1992,m129,PINTA,"Yes, mom?"
68062,L366266,u1990,m129,LISA,We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
68063,L366265,u1992,m129,PINTA,Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
68064,L366264,u1990,m129,LISA,"Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back."
68065,L366263,u1992,m129,PINTA,When?
68066,L366262,u1990,m129,LISA,Good news. You're going back to school.
68067,L366261,u1992,m129,PINTA,"I'm trying, mom."
68068,L366260,u1990,m129,LISA,"You should be sleeping, baby."
68069,L366631,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
68070,L366630,u1990,m129,LISA,She's young. She'll get over it.
68071,L366629,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,It will be a hard break.
68072,L366626,u1990,m129,LISA,He has to go.
68073,L366625,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,"I've just been so busy, Lisa."
68074,L366624,u1990,m129,LISA,It's not.
68075,L366623,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,That's ridiculous.
68076,L366622,u1990,m129,LISA,Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
68077,L366621,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Why? You were so pleased with him.
68078,L366620,u1990,m129,LISA,Creasy.
68079,L366619,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,What? Who?
68080,L366618,u1990,m129,LISA,"He has to go, Samuel."
68081,L366352,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
68082,L366351,u1990,m129,LISA,Creasy. Pinta likes him.
68083,L366350,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Hmm?
68084,L366349,u1990,m129,LISA,She likes him.
68085,L366323,u1990,m129,LISA,You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
68086,L366322,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,I think it's fantastic.
68087,L366321,u1990,m129,LISA,I think it's nice he's American.
68088,L366312,u1990,m129,LISA,"Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?"
68089,L366311,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
68090,L366306,u1990,m129,LISA,"Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy."
68091,L366305,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,"My wife, Mr. Creasy."
68092,L366208,u1990,m129,LISA,"Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed."
68093,L366207,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
68094,L366206,u1990,m129,LISA,Our child's safety is at stake.
68095,L366205,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,Our daughter.
68096,L366204,u1990,m129,LISA,I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
68097,L366203,u1996,m129,SAMUEL,And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
68098,L366202,u1990,m129,LISA,A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
68099,L366986,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]"
68100,L366985,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[Who's that?]
68101,L366926,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[I should start going for your tits first.]
68102,L366925,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,"[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]"
68103,L366923,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[A beautiful circle.]
68104,L366922,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
68105,L366921,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[You only fuck me to get information.]
68106,L366920,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[I think he's... magnificent.]
68107,L366919,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
68108,L366918,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]"
68109,L366917,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[And left three more dead men.]
68110,L366916,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
68111,L366794,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]"
68112,L366793,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[Then what do you have to lose?]
68113,L366792,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
68114,L366791,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[I know this. Your point?]
68115,L366788,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]"
68116,L366787,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
68117,L366786,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
68118,L366785,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
68119,L366675,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
68120,L366674,u1991,m129,MANZANO,[Is that good or bad?]
68121,L366673,u1995,m129,ROSANNA,[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
68122,L366914,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece."
68123,L366913,u1991,m129,MANZANO,And they took that away.
68124,L366912,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again."
68125,L366911,u1991,m129,MANZANO,What was she to Creasy then?
68126,L366910,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead."
68127,L366909,u1991,m129,MANZANO,I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
68128,L366908,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way."
68129,L366907,u1991,m129,MANZANO,This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
68130,L366906,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
68131,L366905,u1991,m129,MANZANO,What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
68132,L366904,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends."
68133,L366903,u1991,m129,MANZANO,You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
68134,L366902,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,I can take care of myself.
68135,L366901,u1991,m129,MANZANO,"Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better."
68136,L366900,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,That's what friends do.
68137,L366899,u1991,m129,MANZANO,You helped him get this job.
68138,L366898,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,Two tourists who never went home.
68139,L366897,u1991,m129,MANZANO,I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
68140,L366896,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
68141,L366895,u1991,m129,MANZANO,Tell me about your friend Creasy.
68142,L366894,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,I already ate.
68143,L366893,u1991,m129,MANZANO,Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
68144,L366693,u1991,m129,MANZANO,So am I.
68145,L366692,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,"He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him."
68146,L366691,u1991,m129,MANZANO,I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
68147,L366690,u1993,m129,RAYBURN,He's not a cop killer.
68148,L370504,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
68149,L370503,u2000,m130,ANDY,You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
68150,L370502,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,What?
68151,L370501,u2000,m130,ANDY,"Hey, Herbie..."
68152,L370484,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,"All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight."
68153,L370483,u2000,m130,ANDY,"Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I..."
68154,L370482,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,"You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all."
68155,L370481,u2000,m130,ANDY,I told you she wasn't attractive...
68156,L370480,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,"She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all."
68157,L370479,u2000,m130,ANDY,"I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl..."
68158,L370941,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"I looked all over for you last night, you know that?"
68159,L370940,u2010,m130,MARTY,Waddaya getting so sore about?
68160,L370939,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?"
68161,L370938,u2010,m130,MARTY,I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
68162,L370935,u2001,m130,ANGIE,She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
68163,L370934,u2010,m130,MARTY,I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
68164,L370930,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old."
68165,L370929,u2010,m130,MARTY,We just talked.
68166,L370928,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Boy, you really musta made out good last night."
68167,L370927,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie."
68168,L370926,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight."
68169,L370921,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture."
68170,L370920,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?"
68171,L370919,u2001,m130,ANGIE,Are you kidding?
68172,L370918,u2010,m130,MARTY,I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
68173,L370917,u2001,m130,ANGIE,Who you gonna call?
68174,L370913,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws."
68175,L370912,u2010,m130,MARTY,We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
68176,L370805,u2010,m130,MARTY,Where you going?
68177,L370804,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"All right, I'll see you!"
68178,L370803,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow."
68179,L370802,u2001,m130,ANGIE,It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
68180,L370801,u2010,m130,MARTY,It must be one o'clock.
68181,L370800,u2001,m130,ANGIE,It's early.
68182,L370799,u2010,m130,MARTY,What for?
68183,L370798,u2001,m130,ANGIE,You want me to ride down with you?
68184,L370797,u2010,m130,MARTY,I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
68185,L370796,u2001,m130,ANGIE,Waddaya gonna do now?
68186,L370793,u2001,m130,ANGIE,I been looking all over for you!
68187,L370792,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you."
68188,L370791,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you."
68189,L370514,u2010,m130,MARTY,I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
68190,L370513,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress."
68191,L370512,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Yeah, she looks all right from here."
68192,L370511,u2001,m130,ANGIE,Down there. That little one there.
68193,L370510,u2010,m130,MARTY,Where?
68194,L370509,u2001,m130,ANGIE,There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
68195,L370508,u2010,m130,MARTY,"There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now."
68196,L370507,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?"
68197,L370386,u2010,m130,MARTY,I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
68198,L370385,u2001,m130,ANGIE,So what do you feel like doing tonight?
68199,L370384,u2010,m130,MARTY,"My mother, boy, she drives me crazy."
68200,L370383,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?"
68201,L370382,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go."
68202,L370381,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?"
68203,L370379,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up."
68204,L370378,u2001,m130,ANGIE,I'll call her up.
68205,L370377,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Yeah, sure."
68206,L370376,u2001,m130,ANGIE,I could see she likes you.
68207,L370375,u2010,m130,MARTY,What makes you say that?
68208,L370374,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, ""What do you feel like doing tonight?"" And you say to me, ""I don't know, what do you feel like doing?"" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you."
68209,L370373,u2010,m130,MARTY,I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
68210,L370372,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?"
68211,L370371,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up."
68212,L370370,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?"
68213,L370369,u2010,m130,MARTY,"She probably got a date by now, Angie."
68214,L370368,u2001,m130,ANGIE,We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
68215,L370367,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, yeah."
68216,L370366,u2001,m130,ANGIE,That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
68217,L370365,u2010,m130,MARTY,Which one was that?
68218,L370364,u2001,m130,ANGIE,"Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?"
68219,L370363,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?"
68220,L370362,u2001,m130,ANGIE,So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
68221,L370905,u2010,m130,MARTY,She wasn't so bad.
68222,L370904,u2002,m130,BARTENDER,Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
68223,L370903,u2010,m130,MARTY,Who told you that?
68224,L370902,u2002,m130,BARTENDER,He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
68225,L370901,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?"
68226,L370388,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?"
68227,L370387,u2002,m130,BARTENDER,"Marty, your mother wants you onna phone."
68228,L370877,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday."
68229,L370876,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house."
68230,L370875,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house."
68231,L370874,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, ""Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around."" Then he's gonna say, ""Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"""
68232,L370873,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
68233,L370872,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment."
68234,L370871,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
68235,L370870,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,Were the lights on?
68236,L370869,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?"
68237,L370868,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,Your son Marty?
68238,L370867,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Marty.
68239,L370866,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,Who?
68240,L370865,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl."
68241,L370596,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Catherine, my sister..."
68242,L370595,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!"
68243,L370594,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house."
68244,L370592,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I know it pains.
68245,L370591,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,It pains that they should do this.
68246,L370590,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself."
68247,L370589,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street."
68248,L370588,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down."
68249,L370587,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?"
68250,L370586,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come."
68251,L370585,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,What they say?
68252,L370584,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"This afternoon, about four, five o'clock."
68253,L370583,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,When was this?
68254,L370582,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
68255,L370581,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,Who?
68256,L370580,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon..."
68257,L370579,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,Ah?
68258,L370578,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me."
68259,L370577,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed."
68260,L370576,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Ufa!
68261,L370575,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,She gave me the evil eye.
68262,L370574,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,What happen?
68263,L370573,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?"
68264,L370572,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,You told me.
68265,L370571,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
68266,L370570,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Well, it ain't your baby."
68267,L370569,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,That's my son Thomas's baby.
68268,L370568,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"It's her baby too, you know."
68269,L370567,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, ""You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"""
68270,L370561,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news."
68271,L370560,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday."
68272,L370559,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Who?
68273,L370558,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"Well, he died. You know who else died?"
68274,L370557,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I don't think I remember him.
68275,L370556,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?"
68276,L370555,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Oh.
68277,L370554,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
68278,L370553,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
68279,L370550,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,That's nice.
68280,L370549,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I feel fine.
68281,L370548,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?"
68282,L370547,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
68283,L370546,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,"I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum."
68284,L370545,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I came to see you. How you feel?
68285,L370544,u2003,m130,CATHERINE,Hey! What are you doing here?
68286,L370813,u2004,m130,CLARA,Okay.
68287,L370812,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then."
68288,L370810,u2004,m130,CLARA,Okay.
68289,L370809,u2010,m130,MARTY,So I'll call you tomorrow.
68290,L370808,u2004,m130,CLARA,We just live one flight up.
68291,L370807,u2010,m130,MARTY,You got an elevator in this house?
68292,L370795,u2004,m130,CLARA,How do you do?
68293,L370794,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him."
68294,L370754,u2004,m130,CLARA,Nothing.
68295,L370753,u2010,m130,MARTY,Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
68296,L370751,u2004,m130,CLARA,All right.
68297,L370750,u2010,m130,MARTY,"We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now."
68298,L370749,u2004,m130,CLARA,I'll wait for your call.
68299,L370748,u2010,m130,MARTY,"The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out."
68300,L370747,u2004,m130,CLARA,I'd like that very much.
68301,L370746,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie."
68302,L370745,u2004,m130,CLARA,Nothing.
68303,L370744,u2010,m130,MARTY,Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
68304,L370738,u2004,m130,CLARA,Marty...
68305,L370737,u2010,m130,MARTY,Please...
68306,L370736,u2004,m130,CLARA,No...
68307,L370735,u2010,m130,MARTY,Please...
68308,L370734,u2004,m130,CLARA,No...
68309,L370733,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I just wanna kiss, that's all."
68310,L370732,u2004,m130,CLARA,Marty...
68311,L370731,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you..."
68312,L370730,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, Marty, please..."
68313,L370729,u2004,m130,CLARA,Maybe that would be a good idea.
68314,L370728,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You want me to take you home, I'll take you home."
68315,L370727,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Oh, I'm fine."
68316,L370726,u2010,m130,MARTY,"So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense."
68317,L370725,u2010,m130,MARTY,Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
68318,L370724,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long."
68319,L370723,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox."
68320,L370722,u2010,m130,MARTY,Come on inna dining room.
68321,L370721,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Yes, I know."
68322,L370720,u2010,m130,MARTY,This is the kitchen.
68323,L370690,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid."
68324,L370689,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Actually, I don't make friends easily."
68325,L370688,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away."
68326,L370687,u2004,m130,CLARA,I'm afraid of being lonely.
68327,L370686,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. ""My mother needs me."" But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life."
68328,L370685,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really..."
68329,L370684,u2010,m130,MARTY,Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
68330,L370683,u2004,m130,CLARA,"...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and..."
68331,L370657,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on..."
68332,L370656,u2010,m130,MARTY,It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
68333,L370655,u2004,m130,CLARA,I really should get home...
68334,L370654,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere."
68335,L370651,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I think anything you want to do, you'll do well."
68336,L370650,u2010,m130,MARTY,Wadda you think?
68337,L370646,u2010,m130,MARTY,"That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?"
68338,L370645,u2004,m130,CLARA,"It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty."
68339,L370644,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too."
68340,L370643,u2004,m130,CLARA,I don't.
68341,L370642,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers."
68342,L370641,u2004,m130,CLARA,There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
68343,L370640,u2010,m130,MARTY,"So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher."
68344,L370639,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Yes, I know."
68345,L370638,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin."
68346,L370637,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Yes, I know."
68347,L370636,u2010,m130,MARTY,"...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels."
68348,L370626,u2004,m130,CLARA,Thank you.
68349,L370625,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face."
68350,L370615,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows."
68351,L370614,u2004,m130,CLARA,Benjamin Franklin High School.
68352,L370613,u2010,m130,MARTY,...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
68353,L370612,u2010,m130,MARTY,I'm thirty-four.
68354,L370611,u2004,m130,CLARA,I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
68355,L370609,u2010,m130,MARTY,I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
68356,L370608,u2004,m130,CLARA,"You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago."
68357,L370607,u2010,m130,MARTY,So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
68358,L370606,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I'm having a very good time, too."
68359,L370605,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are."
68360,L370604,u2004,m130,CLARA,"This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing."
68361,L370603,u2010,m130,MARTY,I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
68362,L370602,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home."
68363,L370601,u2010,m130,MARTY,Yeah.
68364,L370600,u2004,m130,CLARA,I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
68365,L370599,u2010,m130,MARTY,You come up here often?
68366,L370786,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Goodnight.
68367,L370785,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti."
68368,L370782,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Sure.
68369,L370781,u2004,m130,CLARA,"It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again."
68370,L370778,u2004,m130,CLARA,It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
68371,L370777,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother."
68372,L370776,u2004,m130,CLARA,I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
68373,L370775,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
68374,L370774,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple."
68375,L370773,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
68376,L370772,u2004,m130,CLARA,You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
68377,L370771,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years."
68378,L370770,u2004,m130,CLARA,Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
68379,L370769,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home."
68380,L370768,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti."
68381,L370760,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute."
68382,L370759,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway."
68383,L370758,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box."
68384,L370529,u2010,m130,MARTY,You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
68385,L370528,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,"No, I'm not kidding."
68386,L370527,u2010,m130,MARTY,Are you kidding?
68387,L370526,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,"I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks."
68388,L370525,u2010,m130,MARTY,What?
68389,L370524,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,"Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me."
68390,L370523,u2010,m130,MARTY,I'm stag.
68391,L370522,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
68392,L370521,u2010,m130,MARTY,You say something?
68393,L370492,u2007,m130,GIRL,I'll see you.
68394,L370491,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,I'll see you around.
68395,L370490,u2007,m130,GIRL,I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
68396,L370489,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,Where you going now?
68397,L370488,u2007,m130,GIRL,I'm just here with another girl.
68398,L370487,u2005,m130,DR. KEEGAN,"I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?"
68399,L370486,u2007,m130,GIRL,Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
68400,L370682,u2014,m130,SECOND IRISH WOMAN,"Oh, that's a sad story."
68401,L370681,u2006,m130,FIRST IRISH WOMAN,That's the one.
68402,L370680,u2014,m130,SECOND IRISH WOMAN,"Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves."
68403,L370679,u2006,m130,FIRST IRISH WOMAN,"Oh, no! She died right in the hospital..."
68404,L370678,u2014,m130,SECOND IRISH WOMAN,"Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?"
68405,L370668,u2006,m130,FIRST IRISH WOMAN,"Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel."
68406,L370667,u2014,m130,SECOND IRISH WOMAN,"And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?"
68407,L370664,u2006,m130,FIRST IRISH WOMAN,"Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either..."
68408,L370663,u2014,m130,SECOND IRISH WOMAN,She was always a bit thin in the hips...
68409,L370951,u2008,m130,JOE,About eight o'clock.
68410,L370950,u2009,m130,LEO,What time is it?
68411,L370933,u2008,m130,JOE,I never thoughta that.
68412,L370932,u2009,m130,LEO,That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
68413,L370931,u2008,m130,JOE,"I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll."
68414,L370915,u2009,m130,LEO,"Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write."
68415,L370914,u2008,m130,JOE,"What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and..."
68416,L370911,u2009,m130,LEO,"Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write."
68417,L370910,u2008,m130,JOE,"...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, ""You rat, you are the murderer."" So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, ""How could you do that?"" And he says, ""It was easy."""
68418,L370863,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!"
68419,L370862,u2010,m130,MARTY,Sure. This girl said...
68420,L370861,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?"
68421,L370860,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset."
68422,L370858,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy."
68423,L370857,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat."
68424,L370856,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice."
68425,L370854,u2010,m130,MARTY,"No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you."
68426,L370853,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?"
68427,L370852,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so..."
68428,L370838,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Sure, great if you ain't married."
68429,L370837,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?"
68430,L370447,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her..."
68431,L370446,u2010,m130,MARTY,Don't worry about it.
68432,L370445,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay..."
68433,L370444,u2010,m130,MARTY,"All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday."
68434,L370441,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four..."
68435,L370440,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Sure, what?"
68436,L370439,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice."
68437,L370948,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch..."
68438,L370947,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?"
68439,L370899,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma."
68440,L370898,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
68441,L370897,u2010,m130,MARTY,What didn't you like about her?
68442,L370896,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Don't bring her to the house no more.
68443,L370895,u2010,m130,MARTY,You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
68444,L370894,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I don't like her.
68445,L370893,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,She didn't look Italian to me.
68446,L370892,u2010,m130,MARTY,What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
68447,L370890,u2010,m130,MARTY,I don't know. I don't think so.
68448,L370889,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"I said, is she Italian girl?"
68449,L370888,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me."
68450,L370887,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What, Ma?"
68451,L370886,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you."
68452,L370885,u2010,m130,MARTY,"She's twenty-nine, Ma."
68453,L370884,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?"
68454,L370883,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I heard you, Ma."
68455,L370882,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty..."
68456,L370879,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Sure.
68457,L370878,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late."
68458,L370784,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Sure.
68459,L370783,u2010,m130,MARTY,"All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half."
68460,L370780,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Sure.
68461,L370779,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour."
68462,L370767,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing."
68463,L370766,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
68464,L370765,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Might as well siddown a minute, Clara."
68465,L370764,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown."
68466,L370763,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?"
68467,L370762,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us."
68468,L370761,u2010,m130,MARTY,"How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?"
68469,L370757,u2010,m130,MARTY,"We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School."
68470,L370756,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Hello, Marty, when you come home?"
68471,L370476,u2010,m130,MARTY,Ma! Leave me alone!
68472,L370475,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Marty...
68473,L370474,u2010,m130,MARTY,I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
68474,L370473,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,You not ugly.
68475,L370472,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man."
68476,L370471,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Put on your blue suit...
68477,L370470,u2010,m130,MARTY,So I'll die without a son.
68478,L370469,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,You gonna die without a son.
68479,L370468,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason."
68480,L370467,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Marty...
68481,L370466,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you."
68482,L370465,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,You gonna get married.
68483,L370464,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married."
68484,L370463,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance."
68485,L370462,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma."
68486,L370461,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
68487,L370460,u2010,m130,MARTY,Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
68488,L370459,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Tomatoes.
68489,L370458,u2010,m130,MARTY,It's loaded with what?
68490,L370457,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes."
68491,L370456,u2010,m130,MARTY,What?
68492,L370454,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house."

68498,L370424,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house..."
68499,L370423,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Ma."
68500,L370390,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something."

68502,L370907,u2013,m130,RALPH,"Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?"
68503,L370906,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?"
68504,L370712,u2013,m130,RALPH,"This is a good deal here, Marty."
68505,L370711,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight."
68506,L370710,u2013,m130,RALPH,Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
68507,L370709,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm with a girl, Ralph."

68513,L370358,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to."
68514,L370357,u2013,m130,RALPH,The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
68515,L370356,u2010,m130,MARTY,What nurses?

68527,L370332,u2011,m130,MRS. FUSARI,You should be ashamed of yourself.
68528,L370331,u2010,m130,MARTY,"That's swell, Missus Fusari."
68529,L370330,u2011,m130,MRS. FUSARI,"My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?"
68530,L370329,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and..."
68531,L370328,u2011,m130,MRS. FUSARI,"When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, ""Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?"" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married."
68532,L370325,u2011,m130,MRS. FUSARI,Well...
68533,L370324,u2010,m130,MARTY,"No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?"
68534,L370323,u2011,m130,MRS. FUSARI,"I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?"
68535,L370322,u2010,m130,MARTY,"No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie."
68536,L370321,u2011,m130,MRS. FUSARI,"That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache."
68537,L370320,u2010,m130,MARTY,"That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair."
68538,L370319,u2011,m130,MRS. FUSARI,"Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?"
68539,L370830,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr."
68540,L370829,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?"
68541,L370828,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Hello, Aunt Theresa."
68542,L370563,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter."
68543,L370562,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?"
68544,L370541,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
68545,L370540,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see..."
68546,L370539,u2015,m130,THOMAS,I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
68547,L370538,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Hello, Thomas."
68548,L370537,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Hello, Aunt Theresa."
68549,L370432,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Siddown, Thomas, siddown."
68550,L370431,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible."
68551,L370428,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind."
68552,L370427,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here."
68553,L370420,u2015,m130,THOMAS,Right.
68554,L370419,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
68555,L370418,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, ""Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."""
68556,L370417,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?"
68557,L370416,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa."
68558,L370412,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking."
68559,L370411,u2015,m130,THOMAS,Sure.
68560,L370410,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"We gotta ask Marty, of course."
68561,L370409,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa."
68562,L370408,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me."
68563,L370407,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited."
68564,L370565,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Sure, sure."
68565,L370564,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down."
68566,L370536,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling."
68567,L370535,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?"
68568,L370436,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,I'm gonna see you tonight...
68569,L370435,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,On accounta...
68570,L370434,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"That's all right, that's all right..."
68571,L370433,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
68572,L370406,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
68573,L370405,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"No, Virginia, I know how you feel."
68574,L370404,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, ""Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?"" And he said, ""Oh no!"" I know I sound like a terrible woman..."
68575,L370403,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Well...
68576,L370402,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty."
68577,L370401,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,Sure.
68578,L370396,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight."
68579,L370395,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"So she say, ""You're spilling the milk."" So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, ""Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?"" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house."
68580,L370394,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,"She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, ""Catherine, my sister..."""
68581,L370393,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby..."
68582,L370392,u2012,m130,MRS. PILLETTI,He coming home right now.
68583,L370849,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
68584,L370848,u2015,m130,THOMAS,...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
68585,L370847,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
68586,L370846,u2015,m130,THOMAS,Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
68587,L370845,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,Waddaya talking about?!!
68588,L370844,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?"
68589,L370842,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?"
68590,L370841,u2015,m130,THOMAS,Wadda you so sore about?
68591,L370827,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?"
68592,L370826,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,Tommy...
68593,L370822,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!"
68594,L370821,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
68595,L370820,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?"
68596,L370819,u2015,m130,THOMAS,I don't wanna talk about it!
68597,L370818,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,Tommy...
68598,L370817,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?"
68599,L370816,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
68600,L370443,u2015,m130,THOMAS,I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
68601,L370442,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,Tommy!
68602,L370438,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock."
68603,L370437,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in..."
68604,L370414,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?"
68605,L370413,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa."
68606,L370400,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa."
68607,L370399,u2015,m130,THOMAS,Okay.
68608,L370398,u2016,m130,VIRGINIA,"Lemme tell it, Tommy."
68609,L370397,u2015,m130,THOMAS,"Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa..."
68610,L371642,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery."
68611,L371641,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
68612,L371619,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
68613,L371618,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
68614,L371279,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action."
68615,L371278,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
68616,L371277,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"What is, Red, the intention or the act?"
68617,L371276,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
68618,L371275,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him."
68619,L371274,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,What do you want me to do?
68620,L371271,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,He's parted his moorings.
68621,L371270,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,You talked to Walt?
68622,L371269,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?"
68623,L371222,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,"Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game."
68624,L371221,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
68625,L371212,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
68626,L371211,u2017,m131,DAGO RED,"There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention."
68627,L371810,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake."
68628,L371809,u2022,m131,HENRY,Stop him! Stop that man!
68629,L371369,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!"
68630,L371368,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's."
68631,L371367,u2018,m131,DUKE,What are you going to do with him?
68632,L371157,u2018,m131,DUKE,You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
68633,L371156,u2022,m131,HENRY,You boys'll have to go to work early.
68634,L371154,u2018,m131,DUKE,"How you, Radar?"
68635,L371153,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Yes, O'Reilly?"
68636,L371142,u2022,m131,HENRY,I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
68637,L371141,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying."
68638,L371021,u2018,m131,DUKE,Just one for a start.
68639,L371020,u2022,m131,HENRY,I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
68640,L371017,u2022,m131,HENRY,"They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week."
68641,L371016,u2018,m131,DUKE,Never this close.
68642,L371015,u2022,m131,HENRY,Good. You've both been working close to the front.
68643,L371014,u2018,m131,DUKE,They give you copies to burn.
68644,L371013,u2022,m131,HENRY,"You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are."
68645,L371012,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite."
68646,L371011,u2022,m131,HENRY,Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
68647,L371010,u2018,m131,DUKE,Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
68648,L371881,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
68649,L371880,u2018,m131,DUKE,Y'all mind the store.
68650,L371823,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today."
68651,L371822,u2018,m131,DUKE,You really think we hurt him that bad?
68652,L371821,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog."
68653,L371748,u2018,m131,DUKE,Or her figger.
68654,L371747,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
68655,L371707,u2018,m131,DUKE,There's only one way.
68656,L371706,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?"
68657,L371700,u2018,m131,DUKE,"I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter."
68658,L371699,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass."
68659,L371624,u2018,m131,DUKE,Not enough to be a pro.
68660,L371623,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?"
68661,L371622,u2018,m131,DUKE,Epidural hematoma?
68662,L371621,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Look at that right eye.
68663,L371620,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Pulse, slow, very little pressure."
68664,L371255,u2018,m131,DUKE,"He said it for us all, Walt."
68665,L371254,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Miss you, Walt."
68666,L371252,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Pour one for Painless.
68667,L371251,u2018,m131,DUKE,"How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap."
68668,L371186,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country."
68669,L371185,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Don't you use olives?
68670,L371181,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,No.  Or why you should.
68671,L371180,u2018,m131,DUKE,Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
68672,L371179,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Back home.
68673,L371178,u2018,m131,DUKE,Which hospital?
68674,L371177,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Hospital.
68675,L371176,u2018,m131,DUKE,Where?
68676,L371175,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,That's right.
68677,L371174,u2018,m131,DUKE,"I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?"
68678,L371173,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Home.
68679,L371172,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?"
68680,L371864,u2018,m131,DUKE,"No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up."
68681,L371863,u2023,m131,HO-JON,You  must  open  me  up  again?
68682,L371412,u2023,m131,HO-JON,"That's okay. Live a little, learn a little."
68683,L371411,u2018,m131,DUKE,"I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon."
68684,L371103,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?"
68685,L371102,u2023,m131,HO-JON,"I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom."
68686,L371101,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!"
68687,L371100,u2023,m131,HO-JON,Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
68688,L371124,u2019,m131,FRANK,"...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and..."
68689,L371123,u2018,m131,DUKE,Us. Lead us not into...
68690,L371118,u2018,m131,DUKE,"You make a mean martini, kid."
68691,L371117,u2019,m131,FRANK,"So long, Ho-Jon."
68692,L371114,u2018,m131,DUKE,Same general idea.
68693,L371113,u2019,m131,FRANK,Wisconsin.
68694,L371112,u2018,m131,DUKE,"The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?"
68695,L371111,u2019,m131,FRANK,I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
68696,L371108,u2019,m131,FRANK,I don't drink intoxicants.
68697,L371107,u2018,m131,DUKE,But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
68698,L371052,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you."
68699,L371051,u2019,m131,FRANK,"This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English."
68700,L371050,u2018,m131,DUKE,What the hell's going on here?
68701,L371049,u2019,m131,FRANK,"Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!"
68702,L371876,u2018,m131,DUKE,Perfectionist.
68703,L371875,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
68704,L371874,u2018,m131,DUKE,What's there to do? You found the sliver.
68705,L371873,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
68706,L371835,u2018,m131,DUKE,And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
68707,L371834,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,We got to stop them right here.
68708,L371800,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him."
68709,L371799,u2018,m131,DUKE,What?
68710,L371928,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association."
68711,L371927,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time."
68712,L371918,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
68713,L371917,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul."
68714,L371899,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
68715,L371898,u2018,m131,DUKE,But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
68716,L371897,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives."
68717,L371896,u2018,m131,DUKE,I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
68718,L371879,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
68719,L371878,u2018,m131,DUKE,We could steal one of the choppers.
68720,L371877,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
68721,L371872,u2018,m131,DUKE,Be right with you.
68722,L371871,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Any time. Whenever we want.
68723,L371870,u2018,m131,DUKE,When?
68724,L371869,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
68725,L371853,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Same here. You can retire my number.
68726,L371852,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game."
68727,L371817,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Yeah, if I can."
68728,L371816,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
68729,L371806,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
68730,L371805,u2018,m131,DUKE,Look at the size of those two beasts.
68731,L371776,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon."
68732,L371775,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but..."
68733,L371770,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to."
68734,L371769,u2018,m131,DUKE,How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
68735,L371766,u2018,m131,DUKE,The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
68736,L371765,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones."
68737,L371764,u2018,m131,DUKE,Never heard of him.
68738,L371761,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
68739,L371760,u2018,m131,DUKE,Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
68740,L371705,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness."
68741,L371704,u2018,m131,DUKE,"I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth."
68742,L371703,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
68743,L371702,u2018,m131,DUKE,You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
68744,L371701,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
68745,L371694,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,An application to Androscoggin College.
68746,L371693,u2018,m131,DUKE,"What's he got to write, for God's sake?"
68747,L371692,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,When will he be able to write?
68748,L371408,u2018,m131,DUKE,A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
68749,L371407,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Never mind. Forget it.
68750,L371403,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?"
68751,L371402,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers."
68752,L371364,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done."
68753,L371363,u2018,m131,DUKE,That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
68754,L371250,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up."
68755,L371249,u2018,m131,DUKE,Y'all just act natural.
68756,L371215,u2018,m131,DUKE,"What do you think, Trapper?"
68757,L371214,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
68758,L371213,u2018,m131,DUKE,And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
68759,L371206,u2018,m131,DUKE,Call Dago Red.
68760,L371205,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
68761,L371203,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County."
68762,L371202,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?"
68763,L371199,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon."
68764,L371198,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer."
68765,L371197,u2018,m131,DUKE,Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
68766,L371191,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all..."
68767,L371190,u2018,m131,DUKE,Sixteen times.
68768,L371189,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?"
68769,L371151,u2018,m131,DUKE,And it's the ninth inning.
68770,L371150,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
68771,L371149,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble."
68772,L371148,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,The chest-cutter.
68773,L371147,u2018,m131,DUKE,What's that?
68774,L371146,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Except we forgot one other small thing.
68775,L371145,u2018,m131,DUKE,"No, Hawkeye just said it all."
68776,L371137,u2018,m131,DUKE,"We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you."
68777,L371136,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
68778,L371110,u2018,m131,DUKE,We been had.
68779,L371109,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Christ Almighty, I think he means it!"
68780,L371094,u2018,m131,DUKE,So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
68781,L371093,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,He can't take much more time on the table.
68782,L371092,u2018,m131,DUKE,Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
68783,L371062,u2018,m131,DUKE,Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
68784,L371061,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
68785,L371055,u2018,m131,DUKE,"And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one."
68786,L371054,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door."
68787,L371053,u2018,m131,DUKE,Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
68788,L371019,u2018,m131,DUKE,"That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us."
68789,L371018,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here."
68790,L371007,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
68791,L371006,u2018,m131,DUKE,"What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?"
68792,L371005,u2018,m131,DUKE,The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
68793,L371004,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Well, there it is. Jesus!"
68794,L371002,u2018,m131,DUKE,I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
68795,L371001,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?
68796,L371000,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!"
68797,L370999,u2018,m131,DUKE,"What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?"
68798,L370997,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first."
68799,L370996,u2018,m131,DUKE,C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
68800,L370995,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
68801,L370994,u2018,m131,DUKE,Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
68802,L370993,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Crabapple Cove. Maine.
68803,L370992,u2018,m131,DUKE,Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
68804,L370991,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
68805,L370990,u2018,m131,DUKE,"Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate."
68806,L370989,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Make it yourself, or is it real?"
68807,L370988,u2018,m131,DUKE,I got some.
68808,L370987,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up."
68809,L370986,u2018,m131,DUKE,You got directions?
68810,L370985,u2018,m131,DUKE,Duke Forrest.
68811,L370984,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
68812,L371435,u2019,m131,FRANK,I can't... couldn't.
68813,L371434,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,Wait a second...
68814,L371433,u2019,m131,FRANK,Don't stop now! Please...
68815,L371432,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,Frank...
68816,L371421,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,"And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time."
68817,L371420,u2019,m131,FRANK,"Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am."
68818,L371419,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,"It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them."
68819,L371418,u2019,m131,FRANK,"Godless buffoons, all of them."
68820,L371400,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,"Anyway, we want to get this letter off."
68821,L371399,u2019,m131,FRANK,"Well, sure, if you are, Margaret..."
68822,L371398,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,Ravenous. What about you?
68823,L371397,u2019,m131,FRANK,It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
68824,L371396,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,We think the same way.
68825,L371395,u2019,m131,FRANK,We're a good team.
68826,L371394,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,I think it's a marvelous letter.
68827,L371393,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
68828,L371392,u2019,m131,FRANK,People will talk.
68829,L371391,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,I have a tent to myself.
68830,L371390,u2019,m131,FRANK,No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
68831,L371389,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
68832,L371448,u2019,m131,FRANK,Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
68833,L371447,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I was just asking...
68834,L371131,u2019,m131,FRANK,...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
68835,L371130,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?"
68836,L371129,u2019,m131,FRANK,"...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones..."
68837,L371122,u2019,m131,FRANK,...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
68838,L371121,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?"
68839,L371120,u2019,m131,FRANK,Give us this day our daily...
68840,L371106,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
68841,L371105,u2019,m131,FRANK,Is that liquor?
68842,L371828,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up."
68843,L371827,u2022,m131,HENRY,You willing to b-back that up with odds?
68844,L371826,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!"
68845,L371782,u2022,m131,HENRY,"N-n-no thanks, G-General."
68846,L371781,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
68847,L371780,u2022,m131,HENRY,But what about Major Houlihan?
68848,L371779,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
68849,L371778,u2022,m131,HENRY,A football game?
68850,L371777,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine."
68851,L371759,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys."
68852,L371758,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
68853,L371757,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
68854,L371756,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I think I heard about that.
68855,L371755,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
68856,L371754,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage."
68857,L371746,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
68858,L371745,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR."
68859,L371744,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,And there it is.
68860,L371743,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it."
68861,L371742,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,Right.
68862,L371741,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?"
68863,L371740,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why."
68864,L371739,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?"
68865,L371735,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something."
68866,L371734,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"I want to talk to you, Pierce."
68867,L371733,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not."
68868,L371726,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You betcher ass, General."
68869,L371725,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
68870,L371722,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,What?
68871,L371721,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You betcher ass, Dad."
68872,L371720,u2020,m131,GENERAL HAMMOND,"At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game."
68873,L371719,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Gimme three.
68874,L371837,u2031,m131,RADAR,All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
68875,L371836,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Radar!
68876,L371685,u2031,m131,RADAR,I found a doner.
68877,L371684,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I though you said we didn't have a drop.
68878,L371683,u2031,m131,RADAR,A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
68879,L371453,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
68880,L371452,u2031,m131,RADAR,Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
68881,L371451,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
68882,L371895,u2029,m131,MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,"Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here."
68883,L371894,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow."
68884,L371893,u2029,m131,MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,C-A-M-E-M...?
68885,L371892,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert."
68886,L371891,u2029,m131,MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
68887,L371890,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What for?
68888,L371802,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Not necessarily.
68889,L371801,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
68890,L371774,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,He can move in here with us.
68891,L371773,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer."
68892,L371772,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
68893,L371771,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,So what makes you think he'll play for us?
68894,L371768,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
68895,L371767,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,He only lasted one season.
68896,L371763,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
68897,L371762,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
68898,L371709,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,They're coming.
68899,L371708,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
68900,L371682,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now."
68901,L371681,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
68902,L371680,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
68903,L371679,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What do we do?
68904,L371678,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
68905,L371677,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I don't get it.
68906,L371676,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
68907,L371675,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Oh, Jesus."
68908,L371674,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I don't feel anything.
68909,L371671,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble."
68910,L371670,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought."
68911,L371669,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad."
68912,L371668,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
68913,L371667,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first."
68914,L371666,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here."
68915,L371665,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College."
68916,L371661,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!"
68917,L371660,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Christ, it's Ho-Jon!"
68918,L371657,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung."
68919,L371656,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,It's in pretty deep.
68920,L371655,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?"
68921,L371654,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"For you, Trapper."
68922,L371648,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Radar!
68923,L371647,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
68924,L371592,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
68925,L371591,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Is he out?
68926,L371566,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What's the age of consent in this country?
68927,L371565,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
68928,L371564,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today."
68929,L371557,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message."
68930,L371556,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours."
68931,L371555,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal."
68932,L371529,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay."
68933,L371528,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach."
68934,L371527,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
68935,L371512,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?"
68936,L371511,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that."
68937,L371498,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
68938,L371497,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Look.
68939,L371495,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"So let's haul ass, Sergeant."
68940,L371494,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf."
68941,L371490,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
68942,L371489,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
68943,L371486,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs."
68944,L371485,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
68945,L371474,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice."
68946,L371473,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up."
68947,L371417,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology."
68948,L371416,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"No, no, that one."
68949,L371415,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you."
68950,L371304,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
68951,L371303,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
68952,L371298,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
68953,L371297,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,We stand behind all our work.
68954,L371281,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,An eternal damnation.
68955,L371280,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
68956,L371273,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
68957,L371272,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
68958,L371263,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre."
68959,L371262,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Black capsule.
68960,L371218,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini."
68961,L371217,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,...But I turned in my knee pads.
68962,L371201,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan."
68963,L371200,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
68964,L371193,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?"
68965,L371192,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
68966,L371188,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,I like an olive.
68967,L371187,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
68968,L371183,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?"
68969,L371182,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
68970,L371711,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,"No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested."
68971,L371710,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want."
68972,L371387,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here."
68973,L371386,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
68974,L371385,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus."
68975,L371384,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
68976,L371383,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
68977,L371382,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
68978,L371381,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss."
68979,L371380,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,"On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army."
68980,L371379,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk."
68981,L371378,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,Major Burns is far from satisfied.
68982,L371377,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,That's right. We work well together.
68983,L371376,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,All of them?
68984,L371375,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them."
68985,L371374,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,"Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine."
68986,L371373,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?"
68987,L371372,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,"Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?"
68988,L371884,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Hang in there.
68989,L371883,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,It's possible
68990,L371882,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,See you.
68991,L371831,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes."
68992,L371830,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What's the matter?
68993,L371798,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs."
68994,L371797,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?"
68995,L371796,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,I think we could still have a chance.
68996,L371795,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,The bastards outconned us.
68997,L371790,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
68998,L371789,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years..."
68999,L371788,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?"
69000,L371330,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself."
69001,L371329,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life..."
69002,L371328,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you."
69003,L371327,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him..."
69004,L371326,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
69005,L371325,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,You think he won't.
69006,L371324,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy."
69007,L371323,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature."
69008,L371322,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
69009,L371321,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,It happens to be a matter of life and death.
69010,L371320,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,You're asking for somebody else?
69011,L371319,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I didn't mean with me.
69012,L371318,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you."
69013,L371317,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
69014,L371316,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
69015,L371315,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
69016,L371314,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
69017,L371313,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,You're on his side all of the sudden?
69018,L371312,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
69019,L371311,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"Dear, sweet Hawkeye."
69020,L371310,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
69021,L371309,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
69022,L371308,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,You're leaving tomorrow?
69023,L371307,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
69024,L371165,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Maria...
69025,L371164,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,Even if I weren't.
69026,L371091,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it."
69027,L371090,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?"
69028,L371089,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
69029,L371088,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Of course not.
69030,L371087,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't."
69031,L371086,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Ayuh.
69032,L371085,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
69033,L371084,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes."
69034,L371083,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?"
69035,L371082,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Same here.
69036,L371081,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,Very happily married.
69037,L371080,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Something else we have in common.
69038,L371079,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,But I'm married.
69039,L371078,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,You have a certain modest charm yourself.
69040,L371077,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,You're an attractive man.
69041,L371076,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch..."
69042,L371075,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,Our minds?
69043,L371074,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
69044,L371073,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight."
69045,L371072,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,It isn't always this rough?
69046,L371071,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night."
69047,L371070,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
69048,L371069,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,How did you get called that?
69049,L371068,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
69050,L371067,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long."
69051,L371066,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
69052,L371065,u2026,m131,LIEUTENANT DISH,"Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces."
69053,L371471,u2025,m131,KOREAN DOCTOR,Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
69054,L371470,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Why would he do that?
69055,L371469,u2025,m131,KOREAN DOCTOR,"At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake."
69056,L371468,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
69057,L371467,u2025,m131,KOREAN DOCTOR,"I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening."
69058,L371466,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?"
69059,L371465,u2025,m131,KOREAN DOCTOR,You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
69060,L371463,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Yeah!
69061,L371462,u2027,m131,LIEUTENANT SCORCH,You really say the cutest things.
69062,L371461,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I didn't have much choice.
69063,L371460,u2027,m131,LIEUTENANT SCORCH,It was really nice of you to take me along.
69064,L371060,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Duke...
69065,L371059,u2027,m131,LIEUTENANT SCORCH,Second pint.
69066,L371058,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
69067,L371913,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Glad to help.
69068,L371912,u2032,m131,SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,Thanks.
69069,L371911,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,They missed the boat.
69070,L371910,u2032,m131,SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,"Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?"
69071,L371909,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
69072,L371905,u2032,m131,SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
69073,L371904,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What do you want with those two medical officers?
69074,L371903,u2032,m131,SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,"Yes, Reverend?"
69075,L371902,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Excuse me, Sergeant."
69076,L371901,u2032,m131,SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT,Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
69077,L371594,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Let's get his clothes off quick.
69078,L371593,u2028,m131,ME LAY,He's coming to.
69079,L371581,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time."
69080,L371580,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What's wrong with him?
69081,L371579,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male."
69082,L371578,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What's the story?
69083,L371577,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him."
69084,L371576,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Why can't you look at him?
69085,L371538,u2028,m131,ME LAY,That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
69086,L371537,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
69087,L371536,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building."
69088,L371535,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,You don't go after the local scrunch?
69089,L371532,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?"
69090,L371531,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,The one and only.
69091,L371530,u2028,m131,ME LAY,The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
69092,L371526,u2028,m131,ME LAY,Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
69093,L371525,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
69094,L371334,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
69095,L371333,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Morning Painless. How they goin'?
69096,L371302,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,"I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?"
69097,L371301,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through."
69098,L371300,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,How much time do I have?
69099,L371267,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,You guys got any black capsules?
69100,L371266,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,In the direction you want to go.
69101,L371261,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces."
69102,L371260,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
69103,L371246,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,"No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again."
69104,L371245,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but..."
69105,L371244,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,"But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied."
69106,L371243,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
69107,L371242,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
69108,L371241,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Just in dreams?
69109,L371240,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,"No, never in the slightest."
69110,L371239,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
69111,L371238,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
69112,L371237,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,Homosexuality.
69113,L371236,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?"
69114,L371235,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,"Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!"
69115,L371234,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?"
69116,L371233,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
69117,L371232,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
69118,L371231,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,There's only one worth noticing.
69119,L371230,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
69120,L371229,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Tell me the whole story, Walt."
69121,L371228,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,"If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?"
69122,L371033,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Poker sounds great. When do you play?
69123,L371032,u2030,m131,PAINLESS,"Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you."
69124,L371861,u2023,m131,HO-JON,I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
69125,L371860,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Pain bad, Ho-Jon?"
69126,L371410,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,I don't think so either.
69127,L371409,u2023,m131,HO-JON,"And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so."
69128,L371248,u2023,m131,HO-JON,He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
69129,L371247,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it."
69130,L371171,u2023,m131,HO-JON,Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
69131,L371170,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?"
69132,L371116,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Right, Ho-Jon. See you later."
69133,L371115,u2023,m131,HO-JON,"Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes."
69134,L371099,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,That. It's out of the act.
69135,L371098,u2023,m131,HO-JON,I have not understood what you means.
69136,L371097,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,You can cut the bow.
69137,L371096,u2023,m131,HO-JON,"Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest."
69138,L371792,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
69139,L371791,u2022,m131,HENRY,It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
69140,L371646,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too."
69141,L371645,u2022,m131,HENRY,Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
69142,L371371,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington."
69143,L371370,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,First decent idea you've had in a month.
69144,L371366,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
69145,L371365,u2022,m131,HENRY,"I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action."
69146,L371362,u2022,m131,HENRY,There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
69147,L371361,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason."
69148,L371162,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
69149,L371161,u2022,m131,HENRY,"I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!"
69150,L371160,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,About that chest-cutter...
69151,L371159,u2022,m131,HENRY,Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
69152,L371158,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven."
69153,L371144,u2022,m131,HENRY,That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
69154,L371143,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
69155,L371140,u2022,m131,HENRY,Your tent?
69156,L371139,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
69157,L371138,u2022,m131,HENRY,You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
69158,L371025,u2022,m131,HENRY,They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
69159,L371024,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here."
69160,L371023,u2022,m131,HENRY,"If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain."
69161,L371022,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,The blonde dish.
69162,L371009,u2021,m131,HAWKEYE,"Nope, we're assigned heah."
69163,L371008,u2022,m131,HENRY,I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
69164,L371851,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
69165,L371850,u2022,m131,HENRY,"We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch."
69166,L371360,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
69167,L371359,u2022,m131,HENRY,What's wrong with you?
69168,L371357,u2022,m131,HENRY,I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
69169,L371356,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia."
69170,L371353,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,I did. First and only blow. So far.
69171,L371352,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Yes, that's what I mean."
69172,L371351,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,You mean who hit who?
69173,L371350,u2022,m131,HENRY,What's going on? Who started this?
69174,L371611,u2031,m131,RADAR,"And another one, but it's from the south.  There."
69175,L371610,u2022,m131,HENRY,Damn.
69176,L371609,u2031,m131,RADAR,"Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid."
69177,L371450,u2031,m131,RADAR,"I can try, sir."
69178,L371449,u2022,m131,HENRY,Can you make out what they're talking about?
69179,L371439,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Morning, Captain."
69180,L371438,u2031,m131,RADAR,"Splendid, sir. No problems."
69181,L371437,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Morning, Radar. How were things?"
69182,L371436,u2031,m131,RADAR,"Good morning, Colonel."
69183,L371044,u2031,m131,RADAR,"Yes, Colonel."
69184,L371043,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Oh, get out of here!"
69185,L371042,u2031,m131,RADAR,Sir?
69186,L371041,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Stop that, O'Rielly!"
69187,L371040,u2031,m131,RADAR,"To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir."
69188,L371039,u2022,m131,HENRY,Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
69189,L371038,u2031,m131,RADAR,Sir?
69190,L371037,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous."
69191,L371036,u2031,m131,RADAR,Sir?
69192,L370978,u2031,m131,RADAR,"Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?"
69193,L370977,u2022,m131,HENRY,We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
69194,L370976,u2031,m131,RADAR,"I'm afraid so, Colonel."
69195,L370975,u2022,m131,HENRY,"O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?"
69196,L370974,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Yes, dammit, and..."
69197,L370973,u2031,m131,RADAR,One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
69198,L370972,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns..."
69199,L370971,u2031,m131,RADAR,"Yes, sir?"
69200,L370970,u2022,m131,HENRY,O'Reilly!
69201,L371856,u2022,m131,HENRY,I out-coached that General Hammond.
69202,L371855,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"What's that, Henry?"
69203,L371854,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Well, there's one big satisfaction."
69204,L371794,u2022,m131,HENRY,They can't do that to me!
69205,L371793,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams."
69206,L371787,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,I used to throw the javelin.
69207,L371786,u2022,m131,HENRY,"Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?"
69208,L371785,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle."
69209,L371784,u2022,m131,HENRY,"The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind."
69210,L371783,u2033,m131,SPEARCHUCKER,"If I can make a suggestion, Coach."
69211,L371616,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues."
69212,L371615,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
69213,L371614,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Yeah?
69214,L371613,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
69215,L371612,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm."
69216,L371442,u2024,m131,HOT LIPS,Good morning.
69217,L371441,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Morning, girls. Good morning Major."
69218,L371583,u2028,m131,ME LAY,But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
69219,L371582,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
69220,L371575,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Now?
69221,L371574,u2028,m131,ME LAY,Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
69222,L371571,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
69223,L371570,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home."
69224,L371569,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?"
69225,L371547,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy."
69226,L371546,u2028,m131,ME LAY,The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
69227,L371545,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Never mind.
69228,L371543,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
69229,L371542,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland."
69230,L371541,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,What's the bastard really like?
69231,L371534,u2028,m131,ME LAY,I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
69232,L371533,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
69233,L371524,u2028,m131,ME LAY,"May I have the surgeon's name, please?"
69234,L371523,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax."
69235,L371804,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
69236,L371803,u2035,m131,UGLY JOHN,"As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest."
69237,L371691,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Boys, we're home free."
69238,L371690,u2035,m131,UGLY JOHN,Nice.
69239,L371689,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,"Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?"
69240,L371688,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,Arterial silk.
69241,L371687,u2035,m131,UGLY JOHN,Nice.
69242,L371686,u2034,m131,TRAPPER,How is he?
69243,L374404,u2036,m132,ANN,Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
69244,L374403,u2044,m132,JOE,"Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column."
69245,L374402,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!"
69246,L374401,u2044,m132,JOE,"Did you get it, too?"
69247,L374400,u2036,m132,ANN,"A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!"
69248,L374399,u2044,m132,JOE,"You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann."
69249,L375334,u2036,m132,ANN,"John, please let me go with you! Please, John!"
69250,L375333,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Go ahead, driver! Ball park!"
69251,L375301,u2045,m132,JOHN,You didn't?
69252,L375300,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on."
69253,L375299,u2045,m132,JOHN,Did you write this?
69254,L375139,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, butthere you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean."
69255,L375138,u2036,m132,ANN,"Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: ""Love thy neighbor,"" ""Clouds have silver linings,"" ""Turn the other cheek."" It's just a"
69256,L375137,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out."
69257,L375136,u2036,m132,ANN,I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
69258,L375135,u2045,m132,JOHN,"How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?"
69259,L375128,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you."
69260,L375127,u2036,m132,ANN,I guess so. Then what happened?
69261,L375126,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?"
69262,L375125,u2036,m132,ANN,You were? I thought you were chasing me?
69263,L375124,u2045,m132,JOHN,"But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . ."
69264,L375123,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, that's the one."
69265,L375122,u2036,m132,ANN,Ted Sheldon.
69266,L375121,u2045,m132,JOHN,"No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew."
69267,L375120,u2036,m132,ANN,"Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose."
69268,L375119,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?"
69269,L375113,u2045,m132,JOHN,Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
69270,L375112,u2036,m132,ANN,About me?
69271,L375111,u2045,m132,JOHN,"You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you."
69272,L375110,u2036,m132,ANN,No.
69273,L375109,u2045,m132,JOHN,Do you care if I sit down out here?
69274,L375108,u2036,m132,ANN,"No, thank you."
69275,L375107,u2045,m132,JOHN,Can I help you pack?
69276,L374995,u2036,m132,ANN,Uh-huh.
69277,L374994,u2045,m132,JOHN,Me?
69278,L374993,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour."
69279,L374992,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?"
69280,L374991,u2036,m132,ANN,Uh-huh . . .
69281,L374990,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?"
69282,L374989,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you."
69283,L374988,u2045,m132,JOHN,I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
69284,L374987,u2036,m132,ANN,Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
69285,L374986,u2045,m132,JOHN,John Doe Clubs? What for?
69286,L374985,u2036,m132,ANN,"Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going"
69287,L374975,u2045,m132,JOHN,Hello.
69288,L374974,u2036,m132,ANN,"Hello, John."
69289,L374892,u2036,m132,ANN,Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
69290,L374891,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Say, he's a friend of mine."
69291,L374864,u2036,m132,ANN,You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
69292,L374863,u2045,m132,JOHN,Oh. Yeah.
69293,L374862,u2036,m132,ANN,"John Doe, the one in the speech."
69294,L374861,u2045,m132,JOHN,Who?
69295,L374847,u2036,m132,ANN,John Doe. The one in there.
69296,L374846,u2045,m132,JOHN,Who?
69297,L374845,u2036,m132,ANN,Of course not. He wouldn't be.
69298,L374844,u2045,m132,JOHN,No.
69299,L374843,u2036,m132,ANN,"Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?"
69300,L374709,u2036,m132,ANN,"Grab it, Eddie, grab it!"
69301,L374708,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied"
69302,L374707,u2036,m132,ANN,Yes!
69303,L374706,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Oh, yuh did, huh?"
69304,L374705,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?"
69305,L374704,u2045,m132,JOHN,You got me.
69306,L374703,u2036,m132,ANN,Against anything. Just protest.
69307,L374702,u2045,m132,JOHN,Against what?
69308,L374701,u2036,m132,ANN,"Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest."
69309,L374700,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, all those guys in the bleachers think"
69310,L374699,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!"
69311,L374698,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Oh, crabby guy, huh?"
69312,L374697,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now."
69313,L374696,u2045,m132,JOHN,With all of it?
69314,L374695,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization."
69315,L374694,u2045,m132,JOHN,Can't. I'm feeling too good.
69316,L374693,u2036,m132,ANN,"Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression."
69317,L374686,u2036,m132,ANN,Um-hum.

69319,L374586,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since."
69320,L374585,u2036,m132,ANN,He likes you well enough to stick around.
69321,L374584,u2045,m132,JOHN,Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
69322,L374579,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, I'm all right."
69323,L374578,u2036,m132,ANN,Are you all right?
69324,L374577,u2045,m132,JOHN,Huh?
69325,L374569,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe."
69326,L374568,u2036,m132,ANN,Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
69327,L374567,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, maybe."
69328,L374566,u2036,m132,ANN,"Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?"
69329,L375298,u2036,m132,ANN,John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
69330,L375297,u2042,m132,D. B.,Hello?
69331,L375161,u2036,m132,ANN,Mr. D. B. Norton!
69332,L375160,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have."
69333,L375159,u2042,m132,D. B.,Yes. The John Doe Party.
69334,L375158,u2036,m132,ANN,A third party?
69335,L375157,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party."
69336,L375151,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Go ahead, open it, open it."
69337,L375150,u2036,m132,ANN,Oh!
69338,L375149,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down."
69339,L375148,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . ."
69340,L375144,u2042,m132,D. B.,"No, no, nothat's your seat."
69341,L375143,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, somebody else sitting there?"
69342,L374968,u2042,m132,D. B.,"All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man."
69343,L374967,u2036,m132,ANN,Better let me talk to him.
69344,L374750,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yes, sir."
69345,L374749,u2042,m132,D. B.,"And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me."
69346,L374748,u2036,m132,ANN,Thank you very much for everything.
69347,L374744,u2036,m132,ANN,How do you do.
69348,L374743,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell."
69349,L374742,u2042,m132,D. B.,"That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it."
69350,L374741,u2036,m132,ANN,A hundred dollars!
69351,L374740,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week."
69352,L374739,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, I'm sure I can."
69353,L374738,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?"
69354,L374737,u2036,m132,ANN,Money.
69355,L374736,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?"
69356,L374735,u2036,m132,ANN,Thirty dollars.
69357,L374734,u2042,m132,D. B.,How much money do you get?
69358,L374733,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yes, sir."
69359,L374732,u2042,m132,D. B.,". . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?"
69360,L374690,u2036,m132,ANN,Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
69361,L374689,u2043,m132,EDDIE,Oh.
69362,L374688,u2036,m132,ANN,"No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof."
69363,L374687,u2043,m132,EDDIE,That's good.
69364,L374684,u2036,m132,ANN,"Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures."
69365,L374683,u2043,m132,EDDIE,"All set, Ann?"
69366,L374682,u2036,m132,ANN,"Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!"
69367,L374785,u2036,m132,ANN,"You bet I will, Ma."
69368,L374784,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me."
69369,L374783,u2036,m132,ANN,Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
69370,L374782,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"That's your father's diary, Ann."
69371,L374781,u2036,m132,ANN,Huh?
69372,L374780,u2048,m132,MOTHER,Wait a minute . . .
69373,L374779,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, yes, Father certainly would."
69374,L374778,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say."
69375,L374777,u2036,m132,ANN,What?
69376,L374776,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen."
69377,L374775,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!"
69378,L374774,u2048,m132,MOTHER,Do you mean the speech you're writing?
69379,L374773,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!"
69380,L374771,u2036,m132,ANN,"If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away."
69381,L374770,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now."
69382,L374769,u2036,m132,ANN,"You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?"
69383,L374768,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor"
69384,L374767,u2036,m132,ANN,The Websters!
69385,L374766,u2048,m132,MOTHER,The Websters.
69386,L374765,u2036,m132,ANN,"And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?"
69387,L374764,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and"
69388,L374763,u2036,m132,ANN,What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
69389,L374762,u2048,m132,MOTHER,Your purse. I need ten dollars.
69390,L374761,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?"
69391,L374760,u2048,m132,MOTHER,"Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever."
69392,L374759,u2036,m132,ANN,Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
69393,L375435,u2036,m132,ANN,Thank you.
69394,L375434,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying."
69395,L374871,u2036,m132,ANN,"That's fine, honey. Now, get out!"
69396,L374870,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
69397,L374867,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"No, no, no. Now that's too much!"
69398,L374866,u2036,m132,ANN,What's the idea?
69399,L374724,u2036,m132,ANN,"Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him."
69400,L374723,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go."
69401,L374722,u2036,m132,ANN,"If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me."
69402,L374721,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!"
69403,L374718,u2036,m132,ANN,"Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?"
69404,L374717,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him."
69405,L374621,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Awwwww!
69406,L374620,u2036,m132,ANN,"Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand."
69407,L374619,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off."
69408,L374618,u2036,m132,ANN,"Take it easy, John Doe."
69409,L374617,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Okay, fellows."
69410,L374605,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?"
69411,L374604,u2036,m132,ANN,I got it all ready. Here.
69412,L374603,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting."
69413,L374598,u2036,m132,ANN,Oh!
69414,L374597,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Duets? But can we trust him?
69415,L374596,u2036,m132,ANN,Friend of his. They play duets together.
69416,L374595,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Yes.  What's he doing here?
69417,L374594,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, swell! Is that the contract?"
69418,L374593,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
69419,L374592,u2036,m132,ANN,We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
69420,L374591,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Well, maybe you're right."
69421,L374590,u2036,m132,ANN,"Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle."
69422,L374589,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"But, he's gonna jump off a building!"
69423,L374588,u2036,m132,ANN,"No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!"
69424,L374587,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"All right, boys, here he is."
69425,L374576,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Right here. Sit down.
69426,L374575,u2036,m132,ANN,Oh.
69427,L374574,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Hurry up, Pop."
69428,L374572,u2036,m132,ANN,"When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you."
69429,L374571,u2041,m132,CONNELL,I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
69430,L374570,u2036,m132,ANN,That's our man. He's made to order.
69431,L374561,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"I wish he had a family, though."
69432,L374560,u2036,m132,ANN,He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
69433,L374559,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Looks all right
69434,L374540,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut."
69435,L374539,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap."
69436,L374538,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?"
69437,L374537,u2036,m132,ANN,Sorry.
69438,L374536,u2041,m132,CONNELL,I can read. I can read!
69439,L374534,u2041,m132,CONNELL,What bonus?
69440,L374533,u2036,m132,ANN,Plus a bonus.
69441,L374532,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Okay, sister, you get your job back."
69442,L374517,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"That's all, Ned. Thank you."
69443,L374516,u2036,m132,ANN,That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
69444,L374513,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
69445,L374512,u2036,m132,ANN,"You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place."
69446,L374508,u2036,m132,ANN,"Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!"
69447,L374507,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Who, for instance?"
69448,L374506,u2036,m132,ANN,"Well, you're catching on."
69449,L374505,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
69450,L374504,u2036,m132,ANN,"The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!"
69451,L374503,u2041,m132,CONNELL,What John Doe?
69452,L374502,u2036,m132,ANN,John Doe.
69453,L374501,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?"
69454,L374499,u2041,m132,CONNELL,So?
69455,L374498,u2036,m132,ANN,"Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard."
69456,L374497,u2036,m132,ANN,"Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world."
69457,L374496,u2041,m132,CONNELL,A deal?
69458,L374495,u2036,m132,ANN,"Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!"
69459,L374494,u2041,m132,CONNELL,What John Doe?
69460,L374493,u2036,m132,ANN,John Doe.
69461,L374492,u2041,m132,CONNELL,In what man!
69462,L374491,u2036,m132,ANN,"Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!"
69463,L374477,u2036,m132,ANN,Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
69464,L374476,u2041,m132,CONNELL,You made it up.
69465,L374475,u2036,m132,ANN,There is no letter. I made it up.
69466,L374474,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Say that again.
69467,L374473,u2036,m132,ANN,There is no letter.
69468,L374472,u2041,m132,CONNELL,We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
69469,L374471,u2036,m132,ANN,There is no letter.
69470,L374470,u2041,m132,CONNELL,The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
69471,L374469,u2036,m132,ANN,Oh!
69472,L374468,u2041,m132,CONNELL,The letter from John Doe.
69473,L374467,u2036,m132,ANN,What letter?
69474,L374466,u2041,m132,CONNELL,The letter.
69475,L374465,u2036,m132,ANN,What's that?
69476,L374464,u2041,m132,CONNELL,That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
69477,L374463,u2036,m132,ANN,"I remember, distinctly, being fired."
69478,L374462,u2041,m132,CONNELL,No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
69479,L374396,u2036,m132,ANN,"Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please."
69480,L374395,u2041,m132,CONNELL,It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.

69535,L374453,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Did you find her?
69536,L374452,u2037,m132,BEANY,"Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?"

69558,L374642,u2037,m132,BEANY,"Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?"
69559,L374641,u2040,m132,COLONEL,I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
69560,L374637,u2040,m132,COLONEL,Naw.
69561,L374636,u2037,m132,BEANY,Help yourself.
69562,L375488,u2039,m132,BERT'S WIFE,"What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said."
69563,L375487,u2038,m132,BERT,"You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . ."
69564,L375030,u2039,m132,BERT'S WIFE,"Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe."
69565,L375029,u2038,m132,BERT,"Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. ""Why, Grubbel,"" he says, ""he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect,"" he says."
69566,L375028,u2039,m132,BERT'S WIFE,Grubbel's here. See?
69567,L375016,u2038,m132,BERT,"Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey."
69568,L375015,u2039,m132,BERT'S WIFE,"Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey."
69569,L375014,u2038,m132,BERT,"Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another."
69570,L375442,u2038,m132,BERT,"Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof."
69571,L375441,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
69572,L375386,u2038,m132,BERT,"Yeah? Well, you can have it!"
69573,L375385,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,"It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club."
69574,L375354,u2038,m132,BERT,A gag. A gag!
69575,L375353,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,A what?
69576,L375352,u2038,m132,BERT,It must be some kind of a gag.
69577,L375351,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,How could he be a fake?
69578,L375042,u2038,m132,BERT,"Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while."
69579,L375041,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,No!
69580,L375032,u2038,m132,BERT,"Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney"
69581,L375031,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,"Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!"
69582,L375027,u2038,m132,BERT,"Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance."
69583,L375026,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
69584,L375024,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,"Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it."
69585,L375023,u2038,m132,BERT,"Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, ""Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong."" And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. ""If you ask me,"" he says, ""they're starving."""
69586,L375022,u2052,m132,SOURPUSS,"Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background."
69587,L375021,u2038,m132,BERT,"This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe."
69588,L374945,u2045,m132,JOHN,John Doe Club?
69589,L374944,u2040,m132,COLONEL,Join the John Doe Club.
69590,L374936,u2040,m132,COLONEL,Yeh.
69591,L374935,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Better make it doughnuts, huh?"
69592,L374934,u2040,m132,COLONEL,Four bits.
69593,L374933,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?"
69594,L374932,u2040,m132,COLONEL,Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
69595,L374930,u2045,m132,JOHN,Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
69596,L374929,u2040,m132,COLONEL,"Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!"
69597,L374928,u2045,m132,JOHN,"What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . ."
69598,L374927,u2040,m132,COLONEL,"Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her."
69599,L374823,u2040,m132,COLONEL,The elevators are still runnin'.
69600,L374822,u2045,m132,JOHN,I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
69601,L374676,u2040,m132,COLONEL,"You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away."
69602,L374675,u2045,m132,JOHN,"You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it."
69603,L374647,u2040,m132,COLONEL,I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
69604,L374646,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me."
69605,L374633,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this."
69606,L374632,u2040,m132,COLONEL,"Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!"
69607,L374631,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did."
69608,L374630,u2040,m132,COLONEL,"Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?"
69609,L374627,u2040,m132,COLONEL,"No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me."
69610,L374626,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Sure, you are."
69611,L374625,u2040,m132,COLONEL,You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
69612,L374624,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Hey, pretty nifty, huh?"
69613,L375259,u2045,m132,JOHN,Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
69614,L375258,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!"
69615,L375256,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them."
69616,L375255,u2045,m132,JOHN,You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
69617,L375254,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!"
69618,L375253,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea."
69619,L375252,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?"
69620,L375250,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
69621,L375249,u2045,m132,JOHN,Sure.
69622,L375248,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?"
69623,L375247,u2045,m132,JOHN,"You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs."
69624,L375243,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?"
69625,L375242,u2045,m132,JOHN,Yeah. It certainly is.
69626,L375241,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]"
69627,L375240,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, you bet!"
69628,L375239,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?"
69629,L375235,u2045,m132,JOHN,You betcha.
69630,L375234,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Now, that's all right, isn't it?"
69631,L375213,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk."
69632,L375212,u2045,m132,JOHN,"No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way."
69633,L375209,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterare you falling? Come here."
69634,L375208,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Hello, Mr. Connell."
69635,L374607,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!"
69636,L374606,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown."
69637,L374600,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?"
69638,L374599,u2045,m132,JOHN,I trust him.
69639,L375087,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Yes. Sure.
69640,L375086,u2042,m132,D. B.,"I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars."
69641,L375085,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?"
69642,L375083,u2042,m132,D. B.,Whyuh
69643,L375082,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?"
69644,L375081,u2042,m132,D. B.,Well?
69645,L375080,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty."
69646,L375079,u2042,m132,D. B.,Huh? Get what?
69647,L375078,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Well, I don't get it."
69648,L374729,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go."
69649,L374728,u2042,m132,D. B.,I want it as soon as possible.
69650,L374727,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for"

69654,L374530,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys."
69655,L374529,u2050,m132,POP,"If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite."
69656,L374511,u2050,m132,POP,"Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late."
69657,L374510,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business!"
69658,L374486,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. ""Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life."" Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!"
69659,L374485,u2050,m132,POP,"Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and"
69660,L374484,u2041,m132,CONNELL,How?
69661,L374483,u2050,m132,POP,"Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly."
69662,L374565,u2053,m132,TALL CHAP,"Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball."

69665,L374557,u2041,m132,CONNELL,"Oh, just traveling through, huh?"
69666,L374556,u2053,m132,TALL CHAP,No.
69667,L374555,u2041,m132,CONNELL,How about family? Got any family?
69668,L374546,u2053,m132,TALL CHAP,"Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over."
69669,L374545,u2041,m132,CONNELL,What are you doing up here then?
69670,L374544,u2053,m132,TALL CHAP,"No, I didn't."
69671,L374543,u2041,m132,CONNELL,Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
69672,L375376,u2042,m132,D. B.,"There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!"
69673,L375375,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started"
69674,L375374,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!"
69675,L375373,u2045,m132,JOHN,"No, I didn't write it, but"
69676,L375372,u2042,m132,D. B.,Did you write itor didn't you?
69677,L375371,u2045,m132,JOHN,What difference does that make?
69678,L375370,u2042,m132,D. B.,"And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!"
69679,L375369,u2045,m132,JOHN,Yes! I was paid! But the
69680,L375368,u2042,m132,D. B.,Were you paid for itor weren't you?
69681,L375367,u2045,m132,JOHN,That's got nothing to do with it!
69682,L375366,u2042,m132,D. B.,Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
69683,L375365,u2045,m132,JOHN,That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
69684,L375364,u2042,m132,D. B.,It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
69685,L375363,u2045,m132,JOHN,That's a lie!
69686,L375307,u2045,m132,JOHN,No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
69687,L375306,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!"
69688,L375305,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!"
69689,L375304,u2042,m132,D. B.,Is there anything wrong?
69690,L374997,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here."
69691,L374996,u2042,m132,D. B.,"Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement."
69692,L374984,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby."
69693,L374983,u2042,m132,D. B.,"There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people"
69694,L374982,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here."
69695,L375198,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice."
69696,L375197,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,"You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?"
69697,L375196,u2045,m132,JOHN,"I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!"
69698,L375194,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher."
69699,L375193,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,Uh-huh.
69700,L375192,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?"
69701,L375184,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,"Good night, John."
69702,L375183,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell."
69703,L375182,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,"Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers."
69704,L375181,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later."
69705,L375179,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the"
69706,L375178,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,Did you want to see her about something important?
69707,L375177,u2045,m132,JOHN,Oh!
69708,L375176,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,"No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house."
69709,L375175,u2045,m132,JOHN,She isn't?
69710,L375174,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
69711,L375173,u2045,m132,JOHN,Flowers.
69712,L375172,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,"Oh, how nice! Thank you very much."
69713,L375171,u2045,m132,JOHN,It's for Ann . . .
69714,L375170,u2045,m132,JOHN,Thanks.
69715,L375169,u2049,m132,MRS. MITCHELL,It's good to see you. Sit down.
69716,L374857,u2045,m132,JOHN,Okay.
69717,L374856,u2047,m132,MIKE,"Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you."
69718,L374855,u2045,m132,JOHN,Yeah.
69719,L374854,u2047,m132,MIKE,Have you got the speech I gave you?
69720,L374833,u2047,m132,MIKE,Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
69721,L374832,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Say, who's putting up this dough?"
69722,L374828,u2047,m132,MIKE,"Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth."
69723,L374827,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?"
69724,L374826,u2047,m132,MIKE,"Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!"
69725,L374825,u2045,m132,JOHN,How?
69726,L374824,u2047,m132,MIKE,I know one way you can do it.
69727,L374820,u2047,m132,MIKE,"And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina."
69728,L374819,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!"
69729,L374818,u2047,m132,MIKE,"Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?"
69730,L374817,u2045,m132,JOHN,Racket? What do you mean?
69731,L374816,u2047,m132,MIKE,"Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket"
69732,L374815,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a"
69733,L374814,u2047,m132,MIKE,"Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again."
69734,L374813,u2045,m132,JOHN,"What do you mean, too bad?"
69735,L374812,u2047,m132,MIKE,That's too bad.
69736,L374811,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up."
69737,L374810,u2047,m132,MIKE,Nineteen!
69738,L374809,u2045,m132,JOHN,"Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!"
69739,L374444,u2046,m132,MAYOR,"I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!"
69740,L374443,u2051,m132,SECRETARY,"Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird."
69741,L374442,u2046,m132,MAYOR,"A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?"
69742,L374441,u2051,m132,SECRETARY,I think it must have been a sea- gull.
69743,L374440,u2046,m132,MAYOR,Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
69744,L374439,u2051,m132,SECRETARY,"No, sir."
69745,L374438,u2046,m132,MAYOR,Is there a crowd in the street?
69746,L374437,u2046,m132,MAYOR,"Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?"
69747,L374436,u2051,m132,SECRETARY,I didn't see anything.
69748,L374435,u2046,m132,MAYOR,Out the window! Something just flew by!
69749,L374434,u2051,m132,SECRETARY,What?
69750,L374433,u2046,m132,MAYOR,"What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!"
69751,L374432,u2051,m132,SECRETARY,Shh!
69752,L374431,u2046,m132,MAYOR,"Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!"
69753,L374429,u2046,m132,MAYOR,"Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening."
69754,L374428,u2051,m132,SECRETARY,Spencer of the Chronicle .
69755,L378604,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,I'll take half of your action.
69756,L378603,u2065,m133,ROPER,It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
69757,L378602,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,What's the line?
69758,L378600,u2065,m133,ROPER,Good. I don't want to be late.
69759,L378599,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,"Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him."
69760,L378598,u2065,m133,ROPER,You want me to go up with you?
69761,L378597,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Apartment 306.
69762,L378596,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
69763,L378595,u2065,m133,ROPER,Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
69764,L378594,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Where's the stereo?
69765,L378589,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
69766,L378588,u2065,m133,ROPER,Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
69767,L378587,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,No shit! He's good!
69768,L378586,u2065,m133,ROPER,It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
69769,L378585,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
69770,L378584,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization."
69771,L378583,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
69772,L378582,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Yeah, okay."
69773,L378581,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
69774,L378580,u2065,m133,ROPER,"""Phoney Frank""? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar."
69775,L378579,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
69776,L378519,u2065,m133,ROPER,Deal.
69777,L378518,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Dinner's on you.
69778,L378517,u2065,m133,ROPER,You're my hero.
69779,L378516,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Floor seats.
69780,L378433,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
69781,L378432,u2065,m133,ROPER,We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
69782,L378431,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Not that we know of.
69783,L378430,u2065,m133,ROPER,He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
69784,L378429,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,I don't know.
69785,L378428,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there."
69786,L378427,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,No -- you can't do that.
69787,L378423,u2065,m133,ROPER,What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
69788,L378422,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,SWAT wants to go in.
69789,L378421,u2065,m133,ROPER,They're not usually graduate students.
69790,L378418,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,"Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us."
69791,L378417,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Hello, guys."
69792,L378624,u2060,m133,KORDA,Clarence Teal.
69793,L378623,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,This cousin of yours... What's his name?
69794,L378622,u2060,m133,KORDA,Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
69795,L378619,u2060,m133,KORDA,Of course.
69796,L378618,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Could I please have a little water?
69797,L378615,u2060,m133,KORDA,You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
69798,L378614,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,"I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?"
69799,L378613,u2060,m133,KORDA,Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
69800,L378612,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Where did you find an old recording like that?
69801,L378611,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
69802,L378610,u2060,m133,KORDA,"Duke Ellington. ""Things Ain't What They Used To Be"", recorded July 30, 1945."
69803,L378608,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
69804,L378607,u2060,m133,KORDA,What happened? Is there a problem?
69805,L378606,u2054,m133,BAFFERT,It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
69806,L378605,u2060,m133,KORDA,Who is it?
69807,L379024,u2060,m133,KORDA,Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
69808,L379023,u2055,m133,CLARENCE,I won't get away with it.
69809,L379022,u2060,m133,KORDA,Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
69810,L379021,u2055,m133,CLARENCE,"Don't make do it, Mike."
69811,L379018,u2060,m133,KORDA,Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
69812,L379017,u2055,m133,CLARENCE,"Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job."
69813,L379016,u2060,m133,KORDA,You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
69814,L378692,u2060,m133,KORDA,"Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want."
69815,L378691,u2055,m133,CLARENCE,I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
69816,L378690,u2060,m133,KORDA,God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
69817,L378688,u2060,m133,KORDA,You don't want to know.
69818,L378687,u2055,m133,CLARENCE,"What happened, Mike."
69819,L378686,u2060,m133,KORDA,Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
69820,L378685,u2055,m133,CLARENCE,"I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off."
69821,L378684,u2060,m133,KORDA,You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
69822,L378683,u2055,m133,CLARENCE,"So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike."
69823,L378682,u2060,m133,KORDA,You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
69824,L379095,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Is that where you're family lives?
69825,L379094,u2056,m133,DAVE,I hate fucking Springfield.
69826,L379093,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
69827,L379092,u2056,m133,DAVE,Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
69828,L379091,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?"
69829,L379090,u2056,m133,DAVE,Tell my dad.
69830,L379079,u2056,m133,DAVE,Huh?
69831,L379078,u2061,m133,MCCALL,They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
69832,L379077,u2056,m133,DAVE,"It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis."
69833,L379076,u2061,m133,MCCALL,How can I help you with the particles?
69834,L379075,u2056,m133,DAVE,"Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me."
69835,L379074,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Tell me what's wrong.
69836,L379072,u2056,m133,DAVE,They want Walter dead!
69837,L379071,u2061,m133,MCCALL,This has nothing to do with Walter.
69838,L379070,u2056,m133,DAVE,Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
69839,L379069,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Who's controlling your mind?
69840,L379066,u2056,m133,DAVE,"You can't help me, man."
69841,L379065,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave."
69842,L378493,u2065,m133,ROPER,You got it.
69843,L378492,u2057,m133,EARL,Automatic.
69844,L378491,u2065,m133,ROPER,Manual or automatic?
69845,L378489,u2065,m133,ROPER,You want a convertible or hardtop?
69846,L378488,u2057,m133,EARL,What?!
69847,L378481,u2065,m133,ROPER,You're gettin' the car.
69848,L378480,u2057,m133,EARL,Am I gettin' the car?
69849,L378479,u2065,m133,ROPER,The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
69850,L378465,u2065,m133,ROPER,Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
69851,L378464,u2057,m133,EARL,Really?
69852,L378453,u2057,m133,EARL,Then where's my FUCKING car!
69853,L378452,u2065,m133,ROPER,"It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you."
69854,L378444,u2065,m133,ROPER,I need to get something straight first.
69855,L378443,u2057,m133,EARL,Where's the car?
69856,L379168,u2060,m133,KORDA,"Wait a minute, lemme see that."
69857,L379167,u2058,m133,JAIL GUARD #2,"Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second."
69858,L379166,u2060,m133,KORDA,I what?
69859,L379165,u2058,m133,JAIL GUARD #2,You signed out twice.
69860,L379164,u2060,m133,KORDA,Is there a problem?
69861,L379163,u2058,m133,JAIL GUARD #2,Hold on a second here.
69862,L379157,u2058,m133,JAIL GUARD #2,Johnny who?
69863,L379156,u2060,m133,KORDA,"Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?"
69864,L379155,u2058,m133,JAIL GUARD #2,Who are you again?
69865,L378703,u2059,m133,KIMURA,"Roper, we're into it..."
69866,L378702,u2065,m133,ROPER,And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
69867,L378701,u2059,m133,KIMURA,Roper...
69868,L378700,u2065,m133,ROPER,"How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits."
69869,L378699,u2059,m133,KIMURA,Being faxed over now.
69870,L378698,u2065,m133,ROPER,Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
69871,L378697,u2059,m133,KIMURA,We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
69872,L378696,u2065,m133,ROPER,What do you got on Korda?
69873,L378647,u2059,m133,KIMURA,Solis said to keep you clear of this.
69874,L378646,u2065,m133,ROPER,Anything on Korda so far?
69875,L378426,u2065,m133,ROPER,I have to go face to face.
69876,L378425,u2059,m133,KIMURA,Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
69877,L378424,u2065,m133,ROPER,We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
69878,L378416,u2059,m133,KIMURA,Earl.
69879,L378415,u2065,m133,ROPER,What's the suspect's name?
69880,L378414,u2059,m133,KIMURA,That's right.
69881,L378413,u2065,m133,ROPER,"...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes..."
69882,L378412,u2059,m133,KIMURA,"That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't..."
69883,L378411,u2065,m133,ROPER,...a car.
69884,L378410,u2059,m133,KIMURA,The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
69885,L378409,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?"
69886,L378408,u2059,m133,KIMURA,"Hi, Roper."
69887,L379248,u2065,m133,ROPER,I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
69888,L379247,u2060,m133,KORDA,That's not going to look too good on your service record.
69889,L379246,u2065,m133,ROPER,Yeah.
69890,L379245,u2060,m133,KORDA,"I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?"
69891,L379240,u2060,m133,KORDA,Spread it out.
69892,L379239,u2065,m133,ROPER,It's all there.
69893,L379238,u2060,m133,KORDA,"Open the bag, dump everything on the table."
69894,L379237,u2065,m133,ROPER,Satisfied?
69895,L379236,u2060,m133,KORDA,Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
69896,L379235,u2065,m133,ROPER,I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
69897,L379234,u2060,m133,KORDA,Open your shirt.
69898,L378979,u2065,m133,ROPER,What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
69899,L378978,u2060,m133,KORDA,You can't kill me like this.
69900,L378930,u2060,m133,KORDA,I'll give you something.
69901,L378929,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage."
69902,L378928,u2060,m133,KORDA,No. You just do shit for me right now.
69903,L378927,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay."
69904,L378926,u2060,m133,KORDA,For now that's all.
69905,L378925,u2065,m133,ROPER,Is that all?
69906,L378924,u2060,m133,KORDA,I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
69907,L378923,u2060,m133,KORDA,"I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again."
69908,L378922,u2065,m133,ROPER,Yep.
69909,L378921,u2060,m133,KORDA,"Are you in charge, Roper?"
69910,L378918,u2065,m133,ROPER,Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
69911,L378917,u2060,m133,KORDA,"Alright, Roper. You want to come... come."
69912,L378916,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business."
69913,L378915,u2060,m133,KORDA,You don't have to come here.
69914,L379284,u2065,m133,ROPER,Stay put.
69915,L379283,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
69916,L379282,u2065,m133,ROPER,"McCall, you all right?"
69917,L379215,u2065,m133,ROPER,Good question.
69918,L379214,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?"
69919,L379205,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
69920,L379204,u2065,m133,ROPER,That's a chance I gotta take.
69921,L379203,u2061,m133,MCCALL,So what do you want to do?
69922,L379202,u2065,m133,ROPER,He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
69923,L379116,u2065,m133,ROPER,You've got to decide that for yourself.
69924,L379115,u2061,m133,MCCALL,And what if you can't live with it?
69925,L379114,u2065,m133,ROPER,You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
69926,L379113,u2061,m133,MCCALL,And what about the ones you don't save?
69927,L379112,u2065,m133,ROPER,I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
69928,L379111,u2061,m133,MCCALL,How many have you lost?
69929,L379110,u2065,m133,ROPER,That it is.
69930,L379109,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope."
69931,L379108,u2065,m133,ROPER,Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
69932,L379107,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
69933,L379106,u2065,m133,ROPER,It might have happened no matter who was up there.
69934,L378973,u2065,m133,ROPER,Pull up alongside.
69935,L378972,u2061,m133,MCCALL,You're crazy.
69936,L378971,u2065,m133,ROPER,"I don't know, but I've got to get on there."
69937,L378970,u2061,m133,MCCALL,What the fuck is going on.
69938,L378962,u2065,m133,ROPER,Damnit!
69939,L378961,u2061,m133,MCCALL,He's got the girl.
69940,L378953,u2061,m133,MCCALL,And doing a very good job of it.
69941,L378952,u2065,m133,ROPER,He's cutting down the visibility.
69942,L378951,u2061,m133,MCCALL,There's your answer. He's smart.
69943,L378904,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Police corruption. It's everywhere.
69944,L378903,u2065,m133,ROPER,"See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty."
69945,L378898,u2065,m133,ROPER,Occasionally you lose.
69946,L378897,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Is it always like this?
69947,L378896,u2065,m133,ROPER,About six years. My partner took me.
69948,L378895,u2061,m133,MCCALL,How long you been coming here?
69949,L378892,u2061,m133,MCCALL,You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
69950,L378891,u2065,m133,ROPER,How much you wanna bet?
69951,L378890,u2061,m133,MCCALL,We won.
69952,L378889,u2065,m133,ROPER,We lost.
69953,L378888,u2061,m133,MCCALL,We won!
69954,L378887,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"COME ON, RUSSELL!"
69955,L378886,u2065,m133,ROPER,The jockey!
69956,L378885,u2061,m133,MCCALL,COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
69957,L378883,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Yeah, first and second."
69958,L378882,u2061,m133,MCCALL,They need to run first and second?
69959,L378880,u2065,m133,ROPER,He'll be running at the quarter pole.
69960,L378879,u2061,m133,MCCALL,The 6 horse is still last.
69961,L378877,u2065,m133,ROPER,To run late!
69962,L378876,u2061,m133,MCCALL,To run last?
69963,L378875,u2065,m133,ROPER,That's okay. That's his style.
69964,L378874,u2061,m133,MCCALL,The 6 horse is last.
69965,L378871,u2061,m133,MCCALL,You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
69966,L378870,u2065,m133,ROPER,Still needs work.
69967,L378869,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I'm just practicing my lying.
69968,L378868,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
69969,L378867,u2065,m133,ROPER,So what do you want?... An autograph.
69970,L378866,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
69971,L378865,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Ronnie... Yeah, so."
69972,L378863,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Fine.
69973,L378862,u2065,m133,ROPER,We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
69974,L378859,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I do.
69975,L378858,u2065,m133,ROPER,I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
69976,L378857,u2065,m133,ROPER,I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
69977,L378856,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I have two words for you... Seek help.
69978,L378855,u2065,m133,ROPER,See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
69979,L378852,u2061,m133,MCCALL,You're a compulsive gambler?
69980,L378851,u2065,m133,ROPER,You know why I like the track?
69981,L378850,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side..."
69982,L378849,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Why did he do it?
69983,L378846,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine."
69984,L378845,u2065,m133,ROPER,What did you see?
69985,L378843,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Okay, stop."
69986,L378842,u2061,m133,MCCALL,My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
69987,L378840,u2065,m133,ROPER,So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
69988,L378839,u2061,m133,MCCALL,To save lives.
69989,L378838,u2065,m133,ROPER,Why?
69990,L378837,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Yes.
69991,L378836,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?"
69992,L378835,u2061,m133,MCCALL,You tell me.
69993,L378833,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Thou shall have no other God before me.
69994,L378832,u2065,m133,ROPER,What's the first commandment?
69995,L378831,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Yes.
69996,L378830,u2065,m133,ROPER,You know the ten commandments?
69997,L378829,u2061,m133,MCCALL,It's against my nature.
69998,L378828,u2065,m133,ROPER,Get good at it.
69999,L378827,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I'm not good at lying.
70000,L378826,u2065,m133,ROPER,"If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie."
70001,L378825,u2061,m133,MCCALL,What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
70002,L378824,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You could say something like,  ""Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."""
70003,L378823,u2061,m133,MCCALL,So what do I say to this guy?
70004,L378822,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it."
70005,L378820,u2065,m133,ROPER,Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
70006,L378819,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I can't do that.
70007,L378818,u2065,m133,ROPER,I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
70008,L378817,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Tell me what you need.
70009,L378814,u2065,m133,ROPER,It'll come. Try again.
70010,L378813,u2061,m133,MCCALL,No.
70011,L378812,u2065,m133,ROPER,"First things is, don't say, ""What's going on?"" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  ""I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you.""  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?"
70012,L378807,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I think so.
70013,L378806,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You think you can learn, McCall?"
70014,L378803,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Yeah, you think so, but it comes up."
70015,L378802,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I think I can handle that one.
70016,L378801,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Lesson two, ""Dead Eye""... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage."
70017,L378800,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage."
70018,L378799,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Around. Barnett's tough competition.
70019,L378798,u2065,m133,ROPER,Where did you hear that?
70020,L378797,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
70021,L378796,u2065,m133,ROPER,"No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it."
70022,L378795,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Do you really?
70023,L378794,u2065,m133,ROPER,That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
70024,L378793,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Every couple of months, huh?"
70025,L378792,u2061,m133,MCCALL,We see each other every couple of months.
70026,L378791,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Oh, ""city girl"". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?"
70027,L378790,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken."
70028,L378789,u2065,m133,ROPER,"She grow up in Livingtston, too?"
70029,L378788,u2061,m133,MCCALL,She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
70030,L378787,u2065,m133,ROPER,Explain how that works.
70031,L378786,u2061,m133,MCCALL,She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
70032,L378785,u2065,m133,ROPER,You living together?
70033,L378784,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"Yeah, I've got a girlfriend."
70034,L378783,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I don't gamble.
70035,L378782,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?"
70036,L378780,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Why? You like my ass?
70037,L378779,u2065,m133,ROPER,You got a girlfriend?
70038,L378778,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"Well, if I have to, I have to."
70039,L378777,u2065,m133,ROPER,You have to. It's a tradition.
70040,L378776,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I don't really like to drink.
70041,L378775,u2065,m133,ROPER,Come on. Let's go for a drink.
70042,L378772,u2065,m133,ROPER,Not the ones I'm at.
70043,L378771,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
70044,L378734,u2061,m133,MCCALL,We could fill it with water.
70045,L378733,u2065,m133,ROPER,How are we gonna get him out of there?
70046,L378728,u2065,m133,ROPER,I'm not sure.
70047,L378727,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Is there something wrong with that?
70048,L378726,u2065,m133,ROPER,"I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for ""fast advancement""."
70049,L378725,u2061,m133,MCCALL,"You caught me on an ""up"" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?"
70050,L378724,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?"
70051,L378723,u2061,m133,MCCALL,It was okay.
70052,L378722,u2065,m133,ROPER,How did you like Toronto?
70053,L378721,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
70054,L378720,u2065,m133,ROPER,You'd never been out of New York?
70055,L378719,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
70056,L378718,u2065,m133,ROPER,You don't like New York?
70057,L378717,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Furthest point I could find from New York.
70058,L378716,u2065,m133,ROPER,With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
70059,L378715,u2061,m133,MCCALL,National Marksman Competition.
70060,L378714,u2065,m133,ROPER,Recruited you from where?
70061,L378713,u2061,m133,MCCALL,They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
70062,L378712,u2065,m133,ROPER,"So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?"
70063,L378708,u2065,m133,ROPER,I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
70064,L378707,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
70065,L378578,u2065,m133,ROPER,A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
70066,L378577,u2061,m133,MCCALL,What's the point of this?
70067,L378574,u2065,m133,ROPER,Try to remember that.
70068,L378573,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I know.
70069,L378572,u2065,m133,ROPER,"SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know."
70070,L378571,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I've rarely shot anyone.
70071,L378570,u2065,m133,ROPER,It rarely has to be done.
70072,L378569,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Like it had to be done.
70073,L378568,u2065,m133,ROPER,How do you feel after a shooting.
70074,L378567,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Only at the very end.
70075,L378566,u2065,m133,ROPER,You ever been in a hostage situation?
70076,L378562,u2061,m133,MCCALL,If you say so.
70077,L378561,u2065,m133,ROPER,"We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?"
70078,L378559,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Sorry... Habit.
70079,L378558,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?"
70080,L378557,u2061,m133,MCCALL,I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
70081,L378556,u2065,m133,ROPER,You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
70082,L378555,u2061,m133,MCCALL,Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
70083,L378739,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that."
70084,L378738,u2062,m133,OFFICER #1,Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
70085,L378737,u2065,m133,ROPER,Is the hostage injured?
70086,L378736,u2062,m133,OFFICER #1,Only that floor.
70087,L378735,u2065,m133,ROPER,Have you evacuated anyone?
70088,L378731,u2065,m133,ROPER,Which apartment?
70089,L378730,u2062,m133,OFFICER #1,"Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife ""in flagrante"". Now he's holding her at knife point."
70090,L378729,u2065,m133,ROPER,Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
70091,L378764,u2065,m133,ROPER,My name's Scott Roper.
70092,L378763,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,"Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?"
70093,L378762,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count."
70094,L378761,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,And why the fuck would you do that for me?
70095,L378760,u2065,m133,ROPER,"I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work."
70096,L378759,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
70097,L378758,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job."
70098,L378756,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
70099,L378755,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything."
70100,L378754,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,She's the one to blame. Not me.
70101,L378753,u2065,m133,ROPER,Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
70102,L378752,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,I ain't interested in your life story.
70103,L378751,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?"
70104,L378750,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Let me show you something, Ray."
70105,L378749,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
70106,L378748,u2065,m133,ROPER,"I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay."
70107,L378747,u2063,m133,RAYMOND,"You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave."
70108,L378746,u2065,m133,ROPER,"I know how you feel, Ray."
70109,L379315,u2065,m133,ROPER,First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
70110,L379314,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Prude.
70111,L379313,u2065,m133,ROPER,The hell I am!
70112,L379312,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper."
70113,L379311,u2065,m133,ROPER,You crazy? With all those people around?
70114,L379309,u2064,m133,RONNIE,You thought I was talking about getting married?!
70115,L379308,u2065,m133,ROPER,"You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the ""M"" word."
70116,L379307,u2064,m133,RONNIE,I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
70117,L379306,u2065,m133,ROPER,I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
70118,L379305,u2064,m133,RONNIE,...the hell are you talking about?
70119,L379304,u2065,m133,ROPER,I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
70120,L379303,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Scott...
70121,L379302,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality."
70122,L379301,u2064,m133,RONNIE,That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
70123,L379300,u2065,m133,ROPER,A deeper level?
70124,L379299,u2064,m133,RONNIE,I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
70125,L379298,u2064,m133,RONNIE,You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
70126,L379297,u2065,m133,ROPER,Yeah.
70127,L379296,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?"
70128,L379295,u2065,m133,ROPER,Hmm?
70129,L379294,u2064,m133,RONNIE,I've been thinking.
70130,L379293,u2065,m133,ROPER,Hmm?
70131,L379292,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Scottie?
70132,L379289,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit."
70133,L379288,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie."
70134,L379281,u2065,m133,ROPER,Do it!
70135,L379280,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Scottie...
70136,L379279,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Stay here, don't move."
70137,L379278,u2065,m133,ROPER,"It's all over, babe, it's all over."
70138,L379277,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Scottie, Scottie..."
70139,L379189,u2064,m133,RONNIE,I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
70140,L379188,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie."
70141,L379185,u2065,m133,ROPER,Use your imagination.
70142,L379184,u2064,m133,RONNIE,I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
70143,L379181,u2064,m133,RONNIE,And you think he'll...
70144,L379180,u2065,m133,ROPER,Korda escaped.
70145,L379171,u2064,m133,RONNIE,In Europe women find older men very sexy.
70146,L379170,u2065,m133,ROPER,"How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy."
70147,L379135,u2065,m133,ROPER,...Let me just show you.
70148,L379134,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Yeah?
70149,L379133,u2065,m133,ROPER,For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
70150,L379132,u2064,m133,RONNIE,There is?
70151,L379131,u2065,m133,ROPER,I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
70152,L379130,u2064,m133,RONNIE,It's very nice.
70153,L379129,u2065,m133,ROPER,You like this place?
70154,L379027,u2065,m133,ROPER,He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
70155,L379026,u2064,m133,RONNIE,How's Paco doing?
70156,L379012,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Just now.
70157,L379011,u2065,m133,ROPER,When?
70158,L379010,u2064,m133,RONNIE,It's okay. We broke up.
70159,L379009,u2065,m133,ROPER,What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
70160,L379008,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again."
70161,L379007,u2064,m133,RONNIE,It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
70162,L379006,u2065,m133,ROPER,It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
70163,L379005,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning."
70164,L379002,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Scottie...
70165,L379001,u2065,m133,ROPER,Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
70166,L379000,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Yeah that's it.
70167,L378999,u2065,m133,ROPER,"What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar."
70168,L378998,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Mmm, needs a little something."
70169,L378997,u2065,m133,ROPER,What do you think?
70170,L378995,u2064,m133,RONNIE,And it's hard to get.
70171,L378994,u2065,m133,ROPER,I've been craving that stuff all week.
70172,L378993,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese."
70173,L378992,u2065,m133,ROPER,That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
70174,L378988,u2065,m133,ROPER,I was going to catch the last half on TV.
70175,L378987,u2064,m133,RONNIE,It's already started.
70176,L378986,u2065,m133,ROPER,"As a matter of fact, I do."
70177,L378985,u2064,m133,RONNIE,You got a bet on the game tonight?
70178,L378984,u2065,m133,ROPER,I wanted to get this out of the way.
70179,L378674,u2065,m133,ROPER,Ronnie...
70180,L378673,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"If you did, you never showed it."
70181,L378672,u2065,m133,ROPER,You think I didn't need you?
70182,L378671,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again."
70183,L378670,u2065,m133,ROPER,Something I guess I can't have anymore.
70184,L378669,u2064,m133,RONNIE,What do you want from me?
70185,L378668,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work."
70186,L378667,u2065,m133,ROPER,"I've proved that, didn't I?"
70187,L378666,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Scott, You can't save everyone."
70188,L378665,u2065,m133,ROPER,It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
70189,L378664,u2064,m133,RONNIE,You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
70190,L378663,u2065,m133,ROPER,I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
70191,L378659,u2064,m133,RONNIE,About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
70192,L378658,u2065,m133,ROPER,That a new picture?
70193,L378657,u2065,m133,ROPER,Can I come in?
70194,L378656,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Yeah. I'm sorry.
70195,L378655,u2065,m133,ROPER,You heard.
70196,L378654,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Maybe you should be.
70197,L378653,u2065,m133,ROPER,I'm not drunk. Yet.
70198,L378652,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?"
70199,L378651,u2065,m133,ROPER,Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
70200,L378650,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Hey.
70201,L378512,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Oh, I've got to get a shot of this."
70202,L378511,u2065,m133,ROPER,Please. I'm begging you.
70203,L378510,u2065,m133,ROPER,This Greg is really getting in my way.
70204,L378509,u2064,m133,RONNIE,I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
70205,L378508,u2065,m133,ROPER,Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
70206,L378507,u2065,m133,ROPER,Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
70207,L378506,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else."
70208,L378505,u2065,m133,ROPER,Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
70209,L378504,u2064,m133,RONNIE,Greg.
70210,L378503,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name."
70211,L378502,u2064,m133,RONNIE,You worship yourself.
70212,L378501,u2065,m133,ROPER,I worship you.
70213,L378500,u2064,m133,RONNIE,"Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me."
70214,L378499,u2065,m133,ROPER,This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
70215,L378407,u2065,m133,ROPER,SHIT!
70216,L378406,u2067,m133,TRACK ANNOUNCER,Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
70217,L378405,u2065,m133,ROPER,Where's the damn wire?!
70218,L378404,u2067,m133,TRACK ANNOUNCER,Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
70219,L378403,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Stay up there, Girl..."
70220,L378402,u2065,m133,ROPER,I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
70221,L378401,u2067,m133,TRACK ANNOUNCER,It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
70222,L378396,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl..."
70223,L378395,u2067,m133,TRACK ANNOUNCER,"...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing..."
70224,L378965,u2065,m133,ROPER,Come on!
70225,L378964,u2066,m133,SOLIS,"Yeah, they are but..."
70226,L378963,u2065,m133,ROPER,Are these yours?
70227,L378911,u2066,m133,SOLIS,Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
70228,L378910,u2065,m133,ROPER,What have you promised them?
70229,L378909,u2066,m133,SOLIS,"We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself ""Joe"". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for."
70230,L378908,u2065,m133,ROPER,Any verification on numbers.
70231,L378907,u2066,m133,SOLIS,"32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside."
70232,L378906,u2065,m133,ROPER,What do we got?
70233,L378643,u2066,m133,SOLIS,Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
70234,L378642,u2065,m133,ROPER,Who's running it!
70235,L378641,u2066,m133,SOLIS,Roper...
70236,L378640,u2065,m133,ROPER,Who's running it?
70237,L378639,u2066,m133,SOLIS,You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
70238,L378638,u2065,m133,ROPER,I want to be put on this case.
70239,L378637,u2066,m133,SOLIS,I can't do that.
70240,L378636,u2065,m133,ROPER,He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
70241,L378635,u2066,m133,SOLIS,The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
70242,L378553,u2065,m133,ROPER,"And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background..."
70243,L378552,u2066,m133,SOLIS,I'll provide you with transportation.
70244,L378551,u2065,m133,ROPER,Repoed this morning.
70245,L378550,u2066,m133,SOLIS,What happened to your Trans Am?
70246,L378549,u2065,m133,ROPER,The car is part of the deal.
70247,L378548,u2066,m133,SOLIS,Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
70248,L378547,u2065,m133,ROPER,You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
70249,L378546,u2066,m133,SOLIS,"Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own."
70250,L378545,u2065,m133,ROPER,And a car.
70251,L378544,u2066,m133,SOLIS,"Okay, I think I could swing that."
70252,L378543,u2065,m133,ROPER,Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
70253,L378542,u2066,m133,SOLIS,What do you think would be in order?
70254,L378541,u2065,m133,ROPER,The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
70255,L378540,u2066,m133,SOLIS,What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
70256,L378539,u2065,m133,ROPER,Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
70257,L378538,u2066,m133,SOLIS,You let us worry about that.
70258,L378537,u2065,m133,ROPER,"Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks."
70259,L378533,u2066,m133,SOLIS,His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
70260,L378532,u2065,m133,ROPER,Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
70261,L378531,u2066,m133,SOLIS,It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
70262,L378530,u2065,m133,ROPER,Your concern is heartwarming.
70263,L378529,u2066,m133,SOLIS,What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
70264,L378528,u2065,m133,ROPER,Define concern.
70265,L378527,u2066,m133,SOLIS,There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
70266,L378526,u2065,m133,ROPER,Depends. What's up?
70267,L378525,u2066,m133,SOLIS,Are you going to make this hard for me?
70268,L378524,u2065,m133,ROPER,What?
70269,L378523,u2066,m133,SOLIS,Roper.
70270,L378522,u2066,m133,SOLIS,"He says, ""Thank you very much.""  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief."
70271,L378521,u2065,m133,ROPER,Tell him to give me a raise.
70272,L379536,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
70273,L379535,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --"
70274,L379534,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,True.
70275,L379533,u2073,m134,HALDEN,System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
70276,L379530,u2073,m134,HALDEN,-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
70277,L379529,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"Yes, I believe he has --"
70278,L379528,u2073,m134,HALDEN,God-Damn you!
70279,L379526,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
70280,L379525,u2073,m134,HALDEN,They have nothing to do with this --
70281,L379524,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Yes.
70282,L379523,u2073,m134,HALDEN,There are two million people in there with you.
70283,L379522,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,I need to take back what's mine.
70284,L379521,u2073,m134,HALDEN,What do you need?
70285,L379520,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
70286,L379519,u2073,m134,HALDEN,What do you want?
70287,L379518,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"Halden, how nice to hear your voice."
70288,L379517,u2073,m134,HALDEN,This is Halden.
70289,L379663,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
70290,L379662,u2070,m134,DIGITAL GENA,Why --
70291,L379661,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Because I took it out of your memory.
70292,L379660,u2070,m134,DIGITAL GENA,How come I can't remember?
70293,L379659,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life."
70294,L379658,u2070,m134,DIGITAL GENA,She said I have a son...
70295,L379656,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,To live forever.
70296,L379655,u2070,m134,DIGITAL GENA,Why?
70297,L379653,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,It's all been transferred.
70298,L379652,u2070,m134,DIGITAL GENA,Okay...
70299,L379651,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,It's okay.
70300,L379649,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,From the dream.
70301,L379648,u2072,m134,GENA,Wake up?!
70302,L379647,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,It's time to wake up.
70303,L379645,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"Nothing, go back to sleep."
70304,L379644,u2072,m134,GENA,What's happening?
70305,L379638,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
70306,L379637,u2072,m134,GENA,But this is impossible.
70307,L379635,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Just like you always wanted.
70308,L379634,u2072,m134,GENA,Guests?
70309,L379633,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,The guests are here.
70310,L379631,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Yes.
70311,L379630,u2072,m134,GENA,It's all here...
70312,L379452,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,No...
70313,L379451,u2072,m134,GENA,"You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?"
70314,L379429,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Someone who believes in miracles.
70315,L379428,u2072,m134,GENA,Who are you?!
70316,L379424,u2072,m134,GENA,About what?
70317,L379423,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,You were right.
70318,L379421,u2072,m134,GENA,"I'm serious, how did you know my name?"
70319,L379420,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Do you believe in miracles?
70320,L379418,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?"
70321,L379417,u2072,m134,GENA,"No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --"
70322,L379416,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Your life that bad?
70323,L379414,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,-- No.
70324,L379413,u2072,m134,GENA,This is how you pick up women --
70325,L379412,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?"
70326,L379411,u2072,m134,GENA,That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
70327,L379410,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"If you could meet God, what would you say to him?"
70328,L379409,u2072,m134,GENA,As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
70329,L379861,u2078,m134,TANNER,And down here --
70330,L379860,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Only up there in the dream they called life.
70331,L379859,u2078,m134,TANNER,"But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies."
70332,L379858,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,One would assume so.
70333,L379857,u2078,m134,TANNER,"Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do."
70334,L379855,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Yes.
70335,L379854,u2078,m134,TANNER,-- Two million people plugged-in here.
70336,L379853,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --"
70337,L379850,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
70338,L379849,u2078,m134,TANNER,-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
70339,L379848,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
70340,L379734,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end."
70341,L379733,u2078,m134,TANNER,Dream?!
70342,L379732,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"Yes, but only in the dream they call life."
70343,L379731,u2078,m134,TANNER,"You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you."
70344,L379730,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Yes...
70345,L379729,u2078,m134,TANNER,You were the one who was dying.
70346,L379718,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Not real?
70347,L379717,u2078,m134,TANNER,It's not real.
70348,L379716,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,The new world.
70349,L379715,u2078,m134,TANNER,In a computer program.
70350,L379714,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning."
70351,L379713,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,In here I am.
70352,L379712,u2078,m134,TANNER,You are not a God.
70353,L379711,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Yes.
70354,L379710,u2078,m134,TANNER,Divinity?
70355,L379708,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,So wrong --
70356,L379707,u2078,m134,TANNER,Not my problem.
70357,L379706,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
70358,L379704,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Then what?
70359,L379703,u2078,m134,TANNER,No.
70360,L379702,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed."
70361,L379701,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,True.  But why?
70362,L379700,u2078,m134,TANNER,"The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed."
70363,L379557,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,-- He will.
70364,L379556,u2069,m134,DEX,But what if he doesn't --
70365,L379555,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,It's his nature.
70366,L379554,u2069,m134,DEX,You sure he's going to come?
70367,L379553,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
70368,L379552,u2069,m134,DEX,And what about the reconfiguration?
70369,L379551,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,Unfinished business.
70370,L379550,u2069,m134,DEX,Where the hell are you going?
70371,L379549,u2069,m134,DEX,"Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?"
70372,L379548,u2068,m134,CHRISTOPH,"Remember, I'm not the one who chose this."
70373,L379543,u2073,m134,HALDEN,-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
70374,L379542,u2071,m134,EMMA,The maze has been changed --
70375,L379540,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all."
70376,L379539,u2071,m134,EMMA,What about the customers with reservations?
70377,L379538,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system."
70378,L379504,u2071,m134,EMMA,At least a day.
70379,L379503,u2073,m134,HALDEN,How long?
70380,L379502,u2071,m134,EMMA,We're going to have to reconfigure.
70381,L379501,u2073,m134,HALDEN,How long 'till we can eject?
70382,L379402,u2072,m134,GENA,Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
70383,L379401,u2078,m134,TANNER,Take care.
70384,L379395,u2078,m134,TANNER,There is no --
70385,L379394,u2072,m134,GENA,The woman you're stuck on.
70386,L379393,u2078,m134,TANNER,Who?
70387,L379392,u2072,m134,GENA,What's her name?
70388,L379390,u2072,m134,GENA,The weather.
70389,L379389,u2078,m134,TANNER,What?
70390,L379387,u2072,m134,GENA,I'm South Dakota.
70391,L379386,u2078,m134,TANNER,New York.
70392,L379385,u2072,m134,GENA,Where you plugged-in from?
70393,L379778,u2078,m134,TANNER,"If she's alive, you get it back."
70394,L379777,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Insurance?
70395,L379776,u2078,m134,TANNER,Insurance.
70396,L379775,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Need the disk back!
70397,L379773,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Times Square.
70398,L379772,u2078,m134,TANNER,Where?
70399,L379771,u2073,m134,HALDEN,An interface attendant.
70400,L379768,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"Come on Tanner, think this through."
70401,L379767,u2078,m134,TANNER,Then where is she?
70402,L379766,u2073,m134,HALDEN,There was no need to kill her.
70403,L379765,u2078,m134,TANNER,Try harder.
70404,L379764,u2073,m134,HALDEN,We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
70405,L379763,u2078,m134,TANNER,To hide the evidence.
70406,L379762,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Why would I do that?
70407,L379761,u2078,m134,TANNER,Then you had her killed.
70408,L379760,u2078,m134,TANNER,Katie was digitized.
70409,L379759,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Not his style.
70410,L379758,u2078,m134,TANNER,The truth.
70411,L379757,u2073,m134,HALDEN,What did he tell you?
70412,L379617,u2078,m134,TANNER,-- Who did he digitize?!
70413,L379616,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
70414,L379615,u2078,m134,TANNER,Who did he digitize?
70415,L379614,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work."
70416,L379613,u2078,m134,TANNER,"Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need."
70417,L379610,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Good question.
70418,L379609,u2078,m134,TANNER,Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
70419,L379608,u2073,m134,HALDEN,That's right.
70420,L379607,u2078,m134,TANNER,Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
70421,L379606,u2073,m134,HALDEN,He wouldn't say.
70422,L379605,u2078,m134,TANNER,Why?
70423,L379604,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant."
70424,L379603,u2073,m134,HALDEN,It's not used for anything.
70425,L379602,u2078,m134,TANNER,A hotel?
70426,L379601,u2073,m134,HALDEN,The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
70427,L379600,u2078,m134,TANNER,What is it?
70428,L379595,u2078,m134,TANNER,The truth.
70429,L379594,u2073,m134,HALDEN,What?
70430,L379593,u2078,m134,TANNER,One condition.
70431,L379589,u2073,m134,HALDEN,-- Christoph changed the maze.
70432,L379588,u2078,m134,TANNER,"You've got the keys, send someone in --"
70433,L379587,u2073,m134,HALDEN,The only way to eject it is from the inside.
70434,L379584,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it."
70435,L379583,u2078,m134,TANNER,"Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --"
70436,L379582,u2078,m134,TANNER,And you weren't involved.
70437,L379581,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
70438,L379580,u2078,m134,TANNER,Corporate fingerprints all over it.
70439,L379579,u2078,m134,TANNER,-- I saw the program.
70440,L379578,u2073,m134,HALDEN,"Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --"
70441,L379577,u2078,m134,TANNER,Try harder.
70442,L379574,u2078,m134,TANNER,He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
70443,L379573,u2073,m134,HALDEN,You're jumping to conclusions.
70444,L379509,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Go!
70445,L379508,u2078,m134,TANNER,We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
70446,L379494,u2073,m134,HALDEN,-- Yes.
70447,L379493,u2078,m134,TANNER,He had access to the keys --
70448,L379486,u2073,m134,HALDEN,-- He won't.
70449,L379485,u2078,m134,TANNER,Won't be time if he gets access --
70450,L379472,u2078,m134,TANNER,"Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes."
70451,L379471,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Two maze runners.
70452,L379433,u2078,m134,TANNER,"Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job."
70453,L379432,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
70454,L379336,u2078,m134,TANNER,But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
70455,L379335,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
70456,L379331,u2073,m134,HALDEN,Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
70457,L379330,u2078,m134,TANNER,He had keys.
70458,L379838,u2074,m134,KATIE,There was no other choice.
70459,L379837,u2078,m134,TANNER,Sorry?!
70460,L379836,u2074,m134,KATIE,I'm sorry.
70461,L379832,u2074,m134,KATIE,What's the difference?
70462,L379831,u2078,m134,TANNER,Not you.  A copy.
70463,L379830,u2074,m134,KATIE,But you were with me.
70464,L379829,u2078,m134,TANNER,I know.
70465,L379828,u2074,m134,KATIE,I wasn't with you.
70466,L379826,u2074,m134,KATIE,Way you kiss me.
70467,L379825,u2078,m134,TANNER,What?
70468,L379821,u2078,m134,TANNER,Yes.
70469,L379820,u2074,m134,KATIE,And it meant something.
70470,L379816,u2078,m134,TANNER,You weren't real.
70471,L379815,u2074,m134,KATIE,Realize?
70472,L379814,u2078,m134,TANNER,To see how long it would take for me to realize.
70473,L379813,u2074,m134,KATIE,For what?
70474,L379812,u2078,m134,TANNER,It was a test.
70475,L379811,u2074,m134,KATIE,Why?
70476,L379810,u2078,m134,TANNER,"Once they digitized you, they added it."
70477,L379809,u2074,m134,KATIE,But I don't know anything about programming.
70478,L379808,u2078,m134,TANNER,Yes.
70479,L379807,u2074,m134,KATIE,You said we were on the same programming team.
70480,L379805,u2074,m134,KATIE,Her?
70481,L379804,u2078,m134,TANNER,That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
70482,L379803,u2078,m134,TANNER,Corporation can.
70483,L379802,u2074,m134,KATIE,That's not possible.  No one can do that.
70484,L379801,u2078,m134,TANNER,Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
70485,L379794,u2078,m134,TANNER,Night City.
70486,L379793,u2074,m134,KATIE,-- The inside?
70487,L379792,u2078,m134,TANNER,We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
70488,L379791,u2074,m134,KATIE,Who are you?!
70489,L379790,u2078,m134,TANNER,Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
70490,L379788,u2074,m134,KATIE,What are you talking about?
70491,L379787,u2078,m134,TANNER,-- You told me.
70492,L379786,u2074,m134,KATIE,Then how do you know about --
70493,L379785,u2078,m134,TANNER,No.
70494,L379784,u2074,m134,KATIE,You went to my high-school?
70495,L379781,u2078,m134,TANNER,-- Katie.
70496,L379780,u2074,m134,KATIE,"I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --"
70497,L379743,u2078,m134,TANNER,No.
70498,L379742,u2074,m134,KATIE,Someone you have to get back to?
70499,L379380,u2074,m134,KATIE,Tanner.
70500,L379379,u2078,m134,TANNER,I've got to get back.
70501,L379378,u2074,m134,KATIE,"Some things never change, do they?"
70502,L379377,u2078,m134,TANNER,Cleaning up a mess.
70503,L379376,u2074,m134,KATIE,What brings you inside?
70504,L379463,u2076,m134,LAWYER,Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
70505,L379462,u2075,m134,KID,Don't know what you're talking about.
70506,L379448,u2075,m134,KID,Just like that --
70507,L379447,u2076,m134,LAWYER,Just like that?
70508,L379446,u2075,m134,KID,My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
70509,L379445,u2076,m134,LAWYER,There?
70510,L379444,u2075,m134,KID,It was just there.
70511,L379443,u2076,m134,LAWYER,Try me.
70512,L379442,u2075,m134,KID,Because you'll never believe me.
70513,L379441,u2076,m134,LAWYER,Why not?
70514,L379440,u2075,m134,KID,This.  No point to it.
70515,L379439,u2076,m134,LAWYER,What's so funny?
70516,L379438,u2076,m134,LAWYER,Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
70517,L379437,u2075,m134,KID,Don't know what you're talking about.
70518,L379436,u2076,m134,LAWYER,You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
70519,L379435,u2075,m134,KID,"Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side."
70520,L379434,u2076,m134,LAWYER,Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

70604,L384409,u2094,m135,ZORDON,... We must try to communicate with them.
70605,L384408,u2081,m135,ALPHA 5,"I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen."

70619,L384348,u2082,m135,BILLY,Where did it originate?
70620,L384347,u2084,m135,DULCEA,It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.

70700,L384289,u2086,m135,IVAN,"Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!"
70701,L384288,u2085,m135,GOLDAR,"No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting."
70702,L384286,u2085,m135,GOLDAR,You want me to place a few calls?
70703,L384285,u2086,m135,IVAN,Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.

70709,L384439,u2088,m135,MORDANT,Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
70710,L384438,u2086,m135,IVAN,"What do you mean ""basically""?"
70711,L384437,u2088,m135,MORDANT,"""Basically""."
70712,L384436,u2086,m135,IVAN,So they've been destroyed?
70713,L384435,u2088,m135,MORDANT,That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
70714,L384268,u2088,m135,MORDANT,"You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--"

70752,L389794,u2095,m136,AL CAPONE,But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
70753,L389793,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"You've got the public upset, Al."
70754,L389792,u2095,m136,AL CAPONE,"What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!"
70755,L389424,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
70756,L389423,u2095,m136,AL CAPONE,"Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you."
70757,L389422,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,But ya got a Boss.
70758,L389421,u2095,m136,AL CAPONE,One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
70759,L389419,u2095,m136,AL CAPONE,"Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends."
70760,L389418,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,Sure. What's with the brick wall?
70761,L389417,u2095,m136,AL CAPONE,And a lot more. Can we talk?
70762,L389416,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
70763,L389415,u2095,m136,AL CAPONE,I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
70764,L389414,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,So Chicago's been good to ya.
70765,L389471,u2096,m136,BOBBY CLOWES,But not you.
70766,L389470,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Poor, yeah."
70767,L389469,u2096,m136,BOBBY CLOWES,"I remember reading a poem in college. ""Sicily. Poor, noble isle...""."
70768,L389468,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Tell me about it.
70769,L389467,u2096,m136,BOBBY CLOWES,The goddamned bastards.
70770,L389466,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
70771,L389465,u2096,m136,BOBBY CLOWES,"You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke."
70772,L389464,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Charlie Luciano.
70773,L389463,u2096,m136,BOBBY CLOWES,I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
70774,L389791,u2097,m136,BOO-BOO HOFF,Not another word.
70775,L389790,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Boo-Boo.
70776,L389789,u2097,m136,BOO-BOO HOFF,"Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention."
70777,L389788,u2104,m136,LANSKY,The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
70778,L389787,u2097,m136,BOO-BOO HOFF,"Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?"
70779,L389786,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides."
70780,L390100,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
70781,L390099,u2098,m136,CAPONE,"You scare me, Charlie."
70782,L390098,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
70783,L390087,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another."
70784,L390086,u2098,m136,CAPONE,"Whatever you say, Boss."
70785,L390085,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
70786,L390084,u2098,m136,CAPONE,But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
70787,L390083,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
70788,L390082,u2098,m136,CAPONE,"Up here, Boss."
70789,L389587,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,Scared.
70790,L389586,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,What do you mean?
70791,L389585,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,I guess I am. Just a little.
70792,L389584,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
70793,L389583,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,No. Not everything.
70794,L389582,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,And now you have everything.
70795,L389581,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,I came into this world flat on my ass.
70796,L389580,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,Life knocked me back.
70797,L389579,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,So what happened?
70798,L389578,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,I had everything. Once.
70799,L389576,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,Why should I be?
70800,L389575,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,Are you frightened?
70801,L389452,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
70802,L389451,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,"An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat."
70803,L389450,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,"We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze."
70804,L389449,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,"Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy."
70805,L389448,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,"Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily."
70806,L389445,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
70807,L389444,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,I got my partner in there!
70808,L389443,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,Could we step outside?
70809,L389442,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,"I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms."
70810,L389440,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,"Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef."
70811,L389439,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
70812,L389433,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
70813,L389432,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,"When my money moves, I go with it."
70814,L389410,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,If we have to.
70815,L389409,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,We could lose the deal!
70816,L389393,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,He's got a line on the good stuff.
70817,L389392,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,From your mouth ta God's ear.
70818,L389391,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
70819,L389348,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,What's that divided four ways?
70820,L389347,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,Four-twenty-eight.
70821,L389318,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Can't we get a couple whores over?
70822,L389317,u2099,m136,CHARLIE,"When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal."
70823,L389360,u2101,m136,FRANK,But if ya can't catch the guys...
70824,L389359,u2100,m136,DETECTIVE MULLAVEY,It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
70825,L389358,u2101,m136,FRANK,"When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?"
70826,L389357,u2100,m136,DETECTIVE MULLAVEY,"Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand."
70827,L389356,u2101,m136,FRANK,He was around...
70828,L389355,u2100,m136,DETECTIVE MULLAVEY,Shane was a friend of yours?
70829,L389354,u2101,m136,FRANK,You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
70830,L389353,u2100,m136,DETECTIVE MULLAVEY,They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
70831,L390027,u2101,m136,FRANK,Maranzano. Ta ice you.
70832,L390026,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Who hired the bastard?
70833,L390025,u2101,m136,FRANK,Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
70834,L389910,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
70835,L389909,u2101,m136,FRANK,How's Bugsy doin'?
70836,L389908,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
70837,L389891,u2101,m136,FRANK,We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
70838,L389890,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You got men on Profaci's place?
70839,L389889,u2101,m136,FRANK,"Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya."
70840,L389830,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
70841,L389829,u2101,m136,FRANK,He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
70842,L389828,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Bastard didn't even show.
70843,L389648,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Which is why he doesn't need us.
70844,L389647,u2101,m136,FRANK,But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
70845,L389532,u2101,m136,FRANK,"What are ya thinkin', Charlie?"
70846,L389531,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,"The deal's too good, Frankie"
70847,L389525,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
70848,L389524,u2101,m136,FRANK,Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
70849,L389523,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,"Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!"
70850,L389522,u2101,m136,FRANK,I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
70851,L389399,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
70852,L389398,u2101,m136,FRANK,"No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?"
70853,L389326,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,"Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach."
70854,L389325,u2101,m136,FRANK,Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
70855,L389320,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,That ain't what your mama said.
70856,L389319,u2101,m136,FRANK,You ain't even a man yet.
70857,L389316,u2101,m136,FRANK,Long as Charlie says.
70858,L389315,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
70859,L389654,u2101,m136,FRANK,I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
70860,L389653,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take."
70861,L389652,u2101,m136,FRANK,"I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side."
70862,L389560,u2101,m136,FRANK,That's it.
70863,L389559,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
70864,L389558,u2101,m136,FRANK,Well...
70865,L389350,u2101,m136,FRANK,Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
70866,L389349,u2104,m136,LANSKY,A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
70867,L390037,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
70868,L390036,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,"I'm gonna lose you, Charlie."
70869,L390033,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,But there's...
70870,L390032,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I'm doin' business here!
70871,L390031,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,Charlie?
70872,L389918,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,It always is.
70873,L389917,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,Would it be painful for you?
70874,L389913,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,"You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again."
70875,L389912,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
70876,L389875,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me."
70877,L389874,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,I'm very sorry... I didn't...
70878,L389873,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"If I look weak now, it's over."
70879,L389871,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
70880,L389870,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,London?
70881,L389869,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,I booked passage to London.
70882,L389740,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Gives us something in common.
70883,L389739,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,So you all make the same mistakes?
70884,L389738,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
70885,L389737,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,You could have stopped him.
70886,L389672,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Guess I'm too confused to think.
70887,L389671,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,Why? You're the innocent one.
70888,L389670,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Have you thought about this?
70889,L389669,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,It's too late.
70890,L389668,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You got something to hide?
70891,L389667,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,It's a mask.
70892,L389666,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
70893,L389664,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,You're sure?
70894,L389663,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Same here.
70895,L389662,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,I needed to see you again.
70896,L389661,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Something came up.
70897,L389660,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,I was calling yesterday.
70898,L389659,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Luciano.
70899,L389592,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,For what?
70900,L389591,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,I'm already late.
70901,L389590,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
70902,L389589,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,I must be going.
70903,L389588,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,What's the matter?
70904,L389571,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,No. I'm here with you.
70905,L389570,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You here with Bobby?
70906,L389495,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,For being a man.
70907,L389494,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,For being a bootlegger?
70908,L389493,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,No. They envy you.
70909,L389492,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I can just imagine.
70910,L389491,u2102,m136,GAY ORLOVA,"Inside, they were talking of you."
70911,L390097,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
70912,L390096,u2103,m136,JOE PROFACI,Julius Caesar never took no vote.
70913,L390093,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, ""Charlie, we still want you to run things for us"", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no."
70914,L390092,u2103,m136,JOE PROFACI,"Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?"
70915,L390091,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me."
70916,L390090,u2103,m136,JOE PROFACI,Who'll make the rules?
70917,L390089,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war."
70918,L390088,u2103,m136,JOE PROFACI,"Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop."
70919,L389975,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses."
70920,L389974,u2103,m136,JOE PROFACI,Charlie!
70921,L390045,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again."
70922,L390044,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
70923,L390043,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink."
70924,L390042,u2104,m136,LANSKY,What's your problem?
70925,L390041,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?"
70926,L389896,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Tommy Reina.
70927,L389895,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Who?
70928,L389894,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty."
70929,L389893,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us."
70930,L389892,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,"
70931,L389883,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I NEED THE TWENTY!
70932,L389882,u2104,m136,LANSKY,It'll just be a few minutes.
70933,L389881,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"You bastards, I said twenty!"
70934,L389879,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I told you twenty!
70935,L389878,u2104,m136,LANSKY,You're getting' 10 cc's
70936,L389833,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I'll do fine.
70937,L389832,u2104,m136,LANSKY,It's not myself I'm worried about.
70938,L389831,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer."
70939,L389733,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Might as well put the time to use.
70940,L389732,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Your honeymoon, Meyer?"
70941,L389731,u2104,m136,LANSKY,I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
70942,L389730,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,How soon can we pull this off?
70943,L389729,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'."
70944,L389728,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I'll handle the Boss.
70945,L389727,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides."
70946,L389726,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Like Don Maranzano.
70947,L389725,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along."
70948,L389724,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Like a party for all our friends.
70949,L389723,u2104,m136,LANSKY,We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
70950,L389722,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money."
70951,L389721,u2104,m136,LANSKY,I been thinkin'...
70952,L389720,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
70953,L389719,u2104,m136,LANSKY,We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
70954,L389718,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Whatta ya mean? It's great!
70955,L389717,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Guess I'm not a single type guy.
70956,L389716,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on."
70957,L389715,u2104,m136,LANSKY,No. We ain't even...
70958,L389714,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
70959,L389713,u2104,m136,LANSKY,It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
70960,L389712,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Meyer.
70961,L389651,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it."
70962,L389650,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply."
70963,L389627,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
70964,L389626,u2104,m136,LANSKY,We'll figure out something.
70965,L389529,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off."
70966,L389528,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,So what is the problem?
70967,L389527,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem."
70968,L389461,u2104,m136,LANSKY,A million bucks. In the last six months.
70969,L389460,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Meyer just finished the books.
70970,L389287,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
70971,L389286,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You fellas got names?
70972,L389906,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
70973,L389905,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses."
70974,L389900,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you."
70975,L389899,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Why's it gotta be Tommy!
70976,L389898,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war."
70977,L389897,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
70978,L389644,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,They don't give a shit about us!
70979,L389643,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria."
70980,L389635,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Ben-jamin.
70981,L389634,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,"Come off it, Bugs."
70982,L389633,u2104,m136,LANSKY,"Come off it, Bugs."
70983,L389282,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,"Come on. Tell us, Shitface."
70984,L389281,u2104,m136,LANSKY,Yeah. So who the fuck does?
70985,L390010,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
70986,L390009,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie."
70987,L390008,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"One move pardner, and you're a dead man."
70988,L390004,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Couple hands. No harm in it.
70989,L390003,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"Come on, Charlie. We got business."
70990,L390002,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
70991,L390000,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?"
70992,L389999,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Not stupid. Fat.
70993,L389998,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,The kid just called me stupid.
70994,L389997,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be."
70995,L389994,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
70996,L389993,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
70997,L389992,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
70998,L389991,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,But that's an hour's drive.
70999,L389990,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
71000,L389989,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
71001,L389988,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation."
71002,L389986,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Not if they all die at once.
71003,L389985,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us."
71004,L389984,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,They're friends of our enemy.
71005,L389983,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
71006,L389982,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
71007,L389981,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,What are ya thinkin'?
71008,L389956,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way."
71009,L389955,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"Tell me, Charlie. Please."
71010,L389954,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes."
71011,L389953,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
71012,L389952,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,So tell me when I ain't done it.
71013,L389951,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
71014,L389950,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason."
71015,L389823,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,And I got it all planned.
71016,L389822,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You gotta plan these things.
71017,L389821,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
71018,L389819,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Didn't know you felt that way.
71019,L389818,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
71020,L389817,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
71021,L389816,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
71022,L389815,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,I know about you.
71023,L389814,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Boss, I got all the time you need."
71024,L389813,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?"
71025,L389812,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Where we headed?
71026,L389749,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
71027,L389748,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
71028,L389747,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano."
71029,L389746,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,What the fuck does that mean?
71030,L389745,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss."
71031,L389744,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
71032,L389743,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,He's trying to make it.
71033,L389742,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
71034,L389708,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate."
71035,L389707,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,This business is about taking risks.
71036,L389686,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Never threaten me, Boss."
71037,L389685,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
71038,L389684,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside."
71039,L389683,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family."
71040,L389681,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,See if these two are my friends.
71041,L389680,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
71042,L389679,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,You boys carryin' pieces?
71043,L389678,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,"It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out."
71044,L389677,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
71045,L389676,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,I'm glad ya come.
71046,L389554,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,Ya piss like a man.
71047,L389553,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Whatta ya mean, Boss?"
71048,L389552,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,I like that.
71049,L389551,u2109,m136,MASSERIA,Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
71050,L389550,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"If ever I need a Boss, Joe."
71051,L389979,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino."
71052,L389978,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Forget it. That's past.
71053,L389973,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory."
71054,L389972,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,You disrespect our tradition.
71055,L389971,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
71056,L389970,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
71057,L389969,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
71058,L389968,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself."
71059,L389967,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,The terms will be mine.
71060,L389966,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
71061,L389965,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"We must be friends, Charlie."
71062,L389964,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
71063,L389963,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
71064,L389962,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,They do what I tell 'em.
71065,L389961,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
71066,L389860,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
71067,L389859,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together."
71068,L389858,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know."
71069,L389857,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I don't fuck my partners.
71070,L389856,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas."
71071,L389854,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I'll take care of the Boss.
71072,L389853,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
71073,L389852,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
71074,L389851,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,That's why I'm here.
71075,L389850,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,We learn from life.
71076,L389849,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I found that out.
71077,L389848,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind."
71078,L389518,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
71079,L389517,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,And the Jews?
71080,L389516,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us."
71081,L389515,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I got partners.
71082,L389514,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,You get fifteen percent.
71083,L389513,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,What about the share.
71084,L389512,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,We combine everything. You are my second in command.
71085,L389511,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
71086,L389510,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman."
71087,L389507,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him."
71088,L389506,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,He's an animal!
71089,L389505,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
71090,L389504,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
71091,L389503,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I've got friends.
71092,L389502,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,And how many soldiers do you have?
71093,L389501,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started."
71094,L389500,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
71095,L389497,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,The name's Charlie.
71096,L389496,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you."
71097,L389479,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Don, I'd be honored."
71098,L389478,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,Then perhaps you need to know me.
71099,L389477,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Not a lot ta know.
71100,L389476,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,"I must know more of you, my son."
71101,L389475,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Good liquor draws a good crowd.
71102,L389474,u2108,m136,MARANZANO,I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
71103,L389473,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Don Maranzano. Welcome.
71104,L389846,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
71105,L389845,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,And what do you want out of this?
71106,L389844,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.

71110,L389840,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
71111,L389839,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,Strategy.
71112,L389609,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,"A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace."
71113,L389608,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Okay. I'm listening.
71114,L389607,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
71115,L389606,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,We can operate around these guys.
71116,L389605,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,"You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano."
71117,L389604,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,We were overdue to get hit.
71118,L389603,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,Thank you for keeping me informed.

71120,L389601,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,"And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared."
71121,L389600,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,I turned him down flat.
71122,L389599,u2111,m136,ROTHSTEIN,Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
71123,L389904,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is."
71124,L389903,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
71125,L389888,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
71126,L389887,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Guess I'm just lucky.
71127,L389886,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,"Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived."
71128,L389835,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Yeah. But he needs me alive.
71129,L389834,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Maranzano wants you dead.
71130,L389657,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,If it comes to that. Yeah.
71131,L389656,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
71132,L389646,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
71133,L389645,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
71134,L389642,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,You wouldn't live out the week.
71135,L389641,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,"I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good."
71136,L389640,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,"Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems."
71137,L389624,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Fuck 'em.
71138,L389623,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Forget it.
71139,L389565,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Hell. It's been four days!

71142,L389562,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Come on. Be polite.
71143,L389561,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Where's the stiff?
71144,L389521,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,There won't be any way to stay out of it.
71145,L389520,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
71146,L389519,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
71147,L389486,u2112,m136,SIEGEL,I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
71148,L389485,u2105,m136,LUCIANO,Spare us.

71276,L390139,u2124,m137,STU,Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
71277,L390138,u2117,m137,HERB,"Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here..."
71278,L390137,u2124,m137,STU,Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
71279,L390136,u2117,m137,HERB,"Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -"
71280,L390651,u2120,m137,JULIE,Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
71281,L390650,u2118,m137,HUTCH,The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
71282,L390432,u2120,m137,JULIE,What'll it do if they pull the plug?
71283,L390431,u2118,m137,HUTCH,"You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain."
71284,L390429,u2120,m137,JULIE,"I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>."
71285,L390428,u2118,m137,HUTCH,That's not going to stop his nightmare -
71286,L390427,u2120,m137,JULIE,No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
71287,L390424,u2120,m137,JULIE,He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
71288,L390423,u2118,m137,HUTCH,Holy shit.
71289,L390524,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!"
71290,L390523,u2124,m137,STU,You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
71291,L390522,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want."
71292,L390521,u2124,m137,STU,Monkeybone...!?
71293,L390520,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"The monkey, of course. It was his idea."
71294,L390519,u2124,m137,STU,But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
71295,L390518,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!"
71296,L390517,u2124,m137,STU,Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
71297,L390516,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?"
71298,L390515,u2124,m137,STU,YOU SET ME UP!!
71299,L390514,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?"
71300,L390485,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!"
71301,L390484,u2124,m137,STU,NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
71302,L390397,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me."
71303,L390396,u2124,m137,STU,Land of Death. How do I get there?
71304,L390393,u2124,m137,STU,"Hyp, I'll do anything."
71305,L390392,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it."
71306,L390391,u2124,m137,STU,"Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to..."
71307,L390388,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?"
71308,L390387,u2124,m137,STU,You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
71309,L390386,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother."
71310,L390385,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -"
71311,L390384,u2124,m137,STU,Maybe you could talk to Death!
71312,L390383,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick."
71313,L390380,u2124,m137,STU,Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
71314,L390379,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM."
71315,L390378,u2124,m137,STU,"Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never..."
71316,L390374,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?"
71317,L390373,u2124,m137,STU,"I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some..."
71318,L390371,u2124,m137,STU,Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
71319,L390370,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
71320,L390369,u2124,m137,STU,Tell me what?
71321,L390368,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
71322,L390366,u2124,m137,STU,"Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here..."
71323,L390365,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,Uh huh. And?
71324,L390364,u2124,m137,STU,"Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>."
71325,L390363,u2119,m137,HYPNOS,"Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!"
71326,L390702,u2120,m137,JULIE,"He called me ""Doc."""
71327,L390701,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?"
71328,L390698,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
71329,L390697,u2120,m137,JULIE,But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
71330,L390696,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
71331,L390695,u2120,m137,JULIE,It looks so...<u>new</u>.
71332,L390694,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
71333,L390598,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?"
71334,L390597,u2120,m137,JULIE,"You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?"
71335,L390596,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
71336,L390595,u2120,m137,JULIE,"Baby, don't lie. I know you went out."
71337,L390594,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
71338,L390593,u2120,m137,JULIE,Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
71339,L390582,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here."
71340,L390581,u2120,m137,JULIE,What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
71341,L390574,u2120,m137,JULIE,I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
71342,L390573,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy."
71343,L390571,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,I need a new PR guy.
71344,L390570,u2120,m137,JULIE,They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
71345,L390569,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. ""Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma"" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?"
71346,L390568,u2120,m137,JULIE,"I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?"
71347,L390567,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
71348,L390546,u2120,m137,JULIE,Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
71349,L390545,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,Got a doctor on duty.
71350,L390544,u2120,m137,JULIE,You sure this is...medically advisable?
71351,L390543,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"Ohhh, nothing."
71352,L390542,u2120,m137,JULIE,What are you watching?
71353,L390538,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,<i></i> In what way?
71354,L390537,u2120,m137,JULIE,You're acting kind of...odd.
71355,L390536,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,Sure. Why?
71356,L390535,u2120,m137,JULIE,"Stu, are you...feeling okay?"
71357,L390534,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,Bitchin' good cake.
71358,L390532,u2120,m137,JULIE,Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
71359,L390531,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise..."
71360,L390530,u2125,m137,STU-BONE,"Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?"
71361,L390529,u2120,m137,JULIE,"Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back."
71362,L390758,u2124,m137,STU,My <u>tail</u> itches.
71363,L390757,u2120,m137,JULIE,What's the matter?
71364,L390756,u2124,m137,STU,Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
71365,L390755,u2120,m137,JULIE,"Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming."
71366,L390550,u2120,m137,JULIE,"It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER."
71367,L390549,u2124,m137,STU,How was it? I don't recall.
71368,L390490,u2124,m137,STU,"Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker."
71369,L390489,u2120,m137,JULIE,Stu?
71370,L390171,u2124,m137,STU,I'd better go report this...
71371,L390170,u2120,m137,JULIE,"I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky."
71372,L390166,u2124,m137,STU,Are you okay??
71373,L390165,u2120,m137,JULIE,I don't think so.
71374,L390164,u2124,m137,STU,Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
71375,L390162,u2124,m137,STU,I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
71376,L390161,u2120,m137,JULIE,"<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!"
71377,L390160,u2124,m137,STU,I might wake up.
71378,L390159,u2120,m137,JULIE,"What's the ""bad"" part?"
71379,L390158,u2124,m137,STU,"I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?"
71380,L390157,u2120,m137,JULIE,"Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!"
71381,L390156,u2124,m137,STU,The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
71382,L390155,u2120,m137,JULIE,Who?
71383,L390154,u2124,m137,STU,Look at this! He won't let us leave!
71384,L390135,u2124,m137,STU,"Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better."
71385,L390134,u2120,m137,JULIE,Can't you give it to me later?
71386,L390133,u2124,m137,STU,"That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you."
71387,L390132,u2120,m137,JULIE,It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
71388,L390131,u2124,m137,STU,They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
71389,L390130,u2120,m137,JULIE,You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
71390,L390322,u2121,m137,KIMMY,"This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order."
71391,L390321,u2120,m137,JULIE,Kimmy! What's the matter?
71392,L390248,u2121,m137,KIMMY,"Give me a date, Doctor."
71393,L390247,u2120,m137,JULIE,It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
71394,L390246,u2121,m137,KIMMY,"Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out."
71395,L390245,u2120,m137,JULIE,"Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -"
71396,L390235,u2121,m137,KIMMY,Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
71397,L390234,u2120,m137,JULIE,The ring...
71398,L390233,u2121,m137,KIMMY,I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
71399,L390232,u2120,m137,JULIE,"I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine."
71400,L390231,u2121,m137,KIMMY,"An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?"
71401,L390230,u2120,m137,JULIE,When'd you get in?
71402,L390229,u2121,m137,KIMMY,"Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother..."
71403,L390638,u2124,m137,STU,"Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--"
71404,L390637,u2122,m137,KITTY,Go. Just <u>go</u>.
71405,L390636,u2122,m137,KITTY,"<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO."
71406,L390635,u2124,m137,STU,How am I gonna get past the guards?
71407,L390634,u2122,m137,KITTY,You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
71408,L390633,u2124,m137,STU,You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
71409,L390632,u2122,m137,KITTY,Don't ask where I got it.
71410,L390563,u2124,m137,STU,Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
71411,L390562,u2122,m137,KITTY,"You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her."
71412,L390561,u2124,m137,STU,"Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey."
71413,L390560,u2122,m137,KITTY,"I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you."
71414,L390276,u2124,m137,STU,"Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again."
71415,L390275,u2122,m137,KITTY,Hypnos?
71416,L390272,u2122,m137,KITTY,"Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense."
71417,L390271,u2124,m137,STU,Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
71418,L390481,u2124,m137,STU,"Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--"
71419,L390480,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,"Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist."
71420,L390479,u2124,m137,STU,"You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me."
71421,L390478,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,"Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine."
71422,L390477,u2124,m137,STU,"It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?"
71423,L390476,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
71424,L390475,u2124,m137,STU,"You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you."
71425,L390467,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,Isn't that Lulu?
71426,L390466,u2124,m137,STU,What?
71427,L390465,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,Stu...LOOK!
71428,L390464,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,There's a thing here! There's a switch!
71429,L390463,u2124,m137,STU,IT'S NOT WORKING.
71430,L390462,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,Stu...Stu...
71431,L390420,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,I don't <u>know</u>.
71432,L390419,u2124,m137,STU,Where'd he go??
71433,L390418,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,"Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?"
71434,L390417,u2124,m137,STU,"He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you."

71439,L390404,u2124,m137,STU,No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

71445,L390382,u2124,m137,STU,"Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do."
71446,L390381,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -

71452,L390325,u2124,m137,STU,"Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>."
71453,L390324,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,"Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that."

71458,L390303,u2124,m137,STU,"<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!"
71459,L390302,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
71460,L390301,u2124,m137,STU,He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
71461,L390291,u2124,m137,STU,"Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey."

71470,L390279,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
71471,L390274,u2124,m137,STU,I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?

71474,L390266,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,"You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>."

71477,L390263,u2124,m137,STU,Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
71478,L390262,u2123,m137,MONKEYBONE,"I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination."
71479,L390261,u2124,m137,STU,<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
71480,L391793,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything."
71481,L391792,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,You want to come inside?
71482,L391791,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Well, I'd love to see inside your club."
71483,L391790,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,Is there something else I can do for you?
71484,L391789,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
71485,L391788,u2127,m138,MARIAN,What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
71486,L391787,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
71487,L391786,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I'm just concerned about my daughter.
71488,L391785,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,Who told you we deal drugs?
71489,L391784,u2127,m138,MARIAN,And you don't deal drugs?
71490,L391783,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,"We like to think so, yeah."
71491,L391782,u2127,m138,MARIAN,My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
71492,L391781,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,"Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome."
71493,L391780,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday."
71494,L391754,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Have a nice day.
71495,L391753,u2126,m138,DISCIPLE PROSPECT,What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
71496,L391752,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Oh, let me get out of your way then."

71498,L391750,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Oh, please, don't hurt me."
71499,L391862,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Goodbye, sweetheart."
71500,L391861,u2130,m138,PAULA,"Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!"
71501,L391860,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Mm hmm.
71502,L391859,u2130,m138,PAULA,"I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?"
71503,L391858,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I can make my own decisions.
71504,L391857,u2130,m138,PAULA,Mother!
71505,L391856,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better."
71506,L391855,u2130,m138,PAULA,Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
71507,L391854,u2130,m138,PAULA,I'd love to.
71508,L391853,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling."
71509,L391852,u2130,m138,PAULA,You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
71510,L391851,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything."
71511,L391850,u2130,m138,PAULA,I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
71512,L391849,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Mm hmm.
71513,L391848,u2130,m138,PAULA,"It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?"
71514,L391847,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I'm sorry.
71515,L391846,u2130,m138,PAULA,Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
71516,L391845,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Aaron?
71517,L391844,u2130,m138,PAULA,You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
71518,L391843,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Oh, I hope so, dear."
71519,L391842,u2130,m138,PAULA,"No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?"
71520,L391841,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it."
71521,L391840,u2130,m138,PAULA,"Mom, I need to talk to you."
71522,L391834,u2130,m138,PAULA,"No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own."
71523,L391833,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Oh, that has nothing to do with it."
71524,L391832,u2130,m138,PAULA,"Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?"
71525,L391831,u2127,m138,MARIAN,What's wrong?
71526,L391826,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people."
71527,L391825,u2130,m138,PAULA,"Mother, I ..."
71528,L391821,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Oh, it's so nice to meet you."
71529,L391820,u2130,m138,PAULA,"Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer."
71530,L391737,u2130,m138,PAULA,"That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York."
71531,L391736,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"You know, you never tell me anything."
71532,L391735,u2130,m138,PAULA,I don't want to talk about it.
71533,L391734,u2127,m138,MARIAN,He seemed quite taken with you.
71534,L391733,u2130,m138,PAULA,I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
71535,L391732,u2127,m138,MARIAN,But I was dusting.
71536,L391731,u2130,m138,PAULA,Behind the books.
71537,L391730,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Well, they were right out in plain view."
71538,L391729,u2130,m138,PAULA,Mother!
71539,L391728,u2127,m138,MARIAN,You know ...  ... whoops!
71540,L391727,u2130,m138,PAULA,What pictures?
71541,L391726,u2127,m138,MARIAN,What about the fellow in those pictures?
71542,L391725,u2130,m138,PAULA,"No, I'm working too much, I don't have time."
71543,L391724,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Dating anyone?
71544,L391723,u2130,m138,PAULA,I'm good.
71545,L391722,u2127,m138,MARIAN,How are you doing sweetheart?
71546,L391721,u2130,m138,PAULA,That's why it's good you came to visit me.
71547,L391720,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
71548,L391714,u2130,m138,PAULA,I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
71549,L391713,u2127,m138,MARIAN,The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
71550,L391712,u2130,m138,PAULA,That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
71551,L391711,u2127,m138,MARIAN,... What are they all doing there?
71552,L391710,u2130,m138,PAULA,Uh-huh?
71553,L391709,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
71554,L391707,u2130,m138,PAULA,"That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it."
71555,L391706,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!"
71556,L391705,u2130,m138,PAULA,You don't like where I live?
71557,L391704,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Well, once you're inside, it's nice."
71558,L391703,u2130,m138,PAULA,"So, what do you think?"
71559,L391778,u2128,m138,MARIKA,... Manly?
71560,L391777,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
71561,L391775,u2128,m138,MARIKA,"Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice."
71562,L391774,u2127,m138,MARIAN,He's an organic farmer.
71563,L391773,u2128,m138,MARIKA,What does he do?
71564,L391772,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single."
71565,L391771,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
71566,L391770,u2128,m138,MARIKA,What happened?
71567,L391769,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Oh, it was such a big scandal."
71568,L391768,u2128,m138,MARIKA,Really?
71569,L391767,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
71570,L391766,u2128,m138,MARIKA,"And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year."
71571,L391765,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
71572,L391764,u2128,m138,MARIKA,I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
71573,L391763,u2128,m138,MARIKA,Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
71574,L391762,u2127,m138,MARIAN,She's at work.  I'm her mother.
71575,L391761,u2128,m138,MARIKA,It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
71576,L391760,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Who is it?
71577,L391693,u2129,m138,MISCHA,"Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up."
71578,L391692,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
71579,L391691,u2129,m138,MISCHA,Forty-five all total.
71580,L391690,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I see.  How much?
71581,L391689,u2129,m138,MISCHA,Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
71582,L391688,u2127,m138,MARIAN,This way?
71583,L391687,u2129,m138,MISCHA,This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
71584,L391684,u2129,m138,MISCHA,"Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day."
71585,L391683,u2127,m138,MARIAN,You mean it's dangerous?
71586,L391682,u2129,m138,MISCHA,"Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole."
71587,L391681,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
71588,L391680,u2129,m138,MISCHA,Moscow.
71589,L391679,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
71590,L391678,u2129,m138,MISCHA,Yeah.
71591,L391677,u2127,m138,MARIAN,... And the children thought I should take a trip.
71592,L391676,u2129,m138,MISCHA,... Oh ...
71593,L391675,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ..."
71594,L391674,u2129,m138,MISCHA,"So, you come here all by yourself?"
71595,L391673,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here."
71596,L391672,u2129,m138,MISCHA,And where is she?
71597,L391671,u2127,m138,MARIAN,I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
71598,L391669,u2127,m138,MARIAN,"I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute."
71599,L391668,u2129,m138,MISCHA,What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
71600,L391667,u2127,m138,MARIAN,Are you sure you got my bag in?
71601,L391666,u2129,m138,MISCHA,Where to?
71602,L393280,u2131,m139,BOY,"Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up."
71603,L393279,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
71604,L393278,u2131,m139,BOY,I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
71605,L393277,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Thanks very much, sonny--"
71606,L393276,u2131,m139,BOY,"All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff."
71607,L393275,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?"
71608,L393274,u2131,m139,BOY,Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
71609,L393273,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people."
71610,L393272,u2131,m139,BOY,"Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?"
71611,L393271,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
71612,L393270,u2131,m139,BOY,The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
71613,L393269,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Where's the Majority Leader?
71614,L393268,u2131,m139,BOY,"Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page."
71615,L393267,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?"
71616,L393266,u2131,m139,BOY,"Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking."
71617,L393265,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
71618,L393264,u2131,m139,BOY,"Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it."
71619,L393873,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I'm saying I didn't sign it!
71620,L393872,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,"You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?"
71621,L393871,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,It couldn't be.
71622,L393870,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,But it *isn't*?
71623,L393869,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Looks like it, but--"
71624,L393868,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,"Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?"
71625,L393867,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!"
71626,L393866,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
71627,L393865,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Never.
71628,L393864,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,You've never *seen* this contract.
71629,L393863,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I did not--
71630,L393862,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
71631,L393857,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
71632,L393856,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,It was?
71633,L393855,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
71634,L393854,u2132,m139,CHAIRMAN,"--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--""trumped up"" against you!"
71635,L393059,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Blow a bugle!
71636,L393058,u2133,m139,COOK,Let's send out a pigeon!
71637,L393057,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"And while you're at it, get me a bed!"
71638,L393044,u2141,m139,MCGANN,I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
71639,L393043,u2133,m139,COOK,Positively not in the station! Gone!
71640,L393040,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?"
71641,L393039,u2133,m139,COOK,What's he bringing pigeons for?
71642,L393036,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go."
71643,L393035,u2133,m139,COOK,"Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now."
71644,L394128,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--"
71645,L394127,u2134,m139,DIZ,Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
71646,L394126,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What!
71647,L394125,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State."
71648,L394124,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Diz!
71649,L394036,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!"
71650,L394035,u2134,m139,DIZ,He's a house-afire!
71651,L394034,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,The war's on!
71652,L393892,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--"
71653,L393891,u2134,m139,DIZ,"All I know is--he said to me tonight-- ""What does your wife think?"" My wife. Thinks we're married--"
71654,L393890,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?"
71655,L393889,u2134,m139,DIZ,Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
71656,L393888,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Why me?
71657,L393887,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, ""I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?"" He might *listen* to *you*--"
71658,L393886,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!"
71659,L393885,u2134,m139,DIZ,"He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--"
71660,L393736,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Take me home, Diz."
71661,L393735,u2134,m139,DIZ,"You know, we're getting married."
71662,L393734,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Huh?
71663,L393733,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid."
71664,L393719,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Right now--everything I own--!
71665,L393718,u2134,m139,DIZ,Hey! We're gettin' married--!
71666,L393717,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--"
71667,L393716,u2134,m139,DIZ,You said it!
71668,L393715,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir."
71669,L393714,u2134,m139,DIZ,Susan? Nah!
71670,L393713,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?"
71671,L393712,u2134,m139,DIZ,No--not offhand--
71672,L393711,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?"
71673,L393710,u2134,m139,DIZ,Okay--I mean--
71674,L393709,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Don't say ""okay,"" Diz. Say you think it's beautiful."
71675,L393708,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Yeah, I know. That's okay."
71676,L393707,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,My first name's--Clarissa.
71677,L393706,u2134,m139,DIZ,What?
71678,L393705,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
71679,L393704,u2134,m139,DIZ,What?
71680,L393703,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yeah--that's right. Diz--
71681,L393702,u2134,m139,DIZ,We're gonna get married.
71682,L393701,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Where?
71683,L393700,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Well, let's get going."
71684,L393699,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
71685,L393698,u2134,m139,DIZ,Do we *have* to?
71686,L393697,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No.
71687,L393696,u2134,m139,DIZ,Have *you*?
71688,L393695,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?"
71689,L393694,u2134,m139,DIZ,Is the wind tired out there?
71690,L393693,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?"
71691,L393692,u2134,m139,DIZ,Tunnel?
71692,L393691,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel."
71693,L393690,u2134,m139,DIZ,I'll cherish ya.
71694,L393689,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Okay. You don't mind?
71695,L393688,u2134,m139,DIZ,Tonight?
71696,L393687,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Any time.
71697,L393686,u2134,m139,DIZ,Good idea. When?
71698,L393685,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,How about getting married?
71699,L393684,u2134,m139,DIZ,Yeah.
71700,L393683,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Diz--
71701,L393682,u2134,m139,DIZ,Again? Good idea.
71702,L393681,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through."
71703,L393680,u2134,m139,DIZ,I apologize.
71704,L393679,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
71705,L393678,u2134,m139,DIZ,*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
71706,L393677,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
71707,L393676,u2134,m139,DIZ,No. How'd you feel? Quick.
71708,L393675,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Do you know how I felt, Diz?"
71709,L393674,u2134,m139,DIZ,Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
71710,L393673,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--"
71711,L393672,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!"
71712,L393671,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Shut up, Diz."
71713,L393670,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!"
71714,L393669,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
71715,L393668,u2134,m139,DIZ,Waiter!
71716,L393667,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
71717,L393666,u2134,m139,DIZ,My friends?
71718,L393665,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz."
71719,L393664,u2134,m139,DIZ,Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
71720,L393663,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yeah.
71721,L393662,u2134,m139,DIZ,Yeah. Funny--
71722,L393661,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Drunks are funny--
71723,L393660,u2134,m139,DIZ,"""There's more light here,"" he says--"
71724,L393659,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Why do I always laugh at that?
71725,L393657,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,And to Don Quixote!
71726,L393656,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid."
71727,L393655,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--"
71728,L393654,u2134,m139,DIZ,Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
71729,L393653,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--"
71730,L393652,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?"
71731,L393651,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! ""I'll turn my glamour on him,"" she says--"
71732,L393650,u2134,m139,DIZ,Oh--yeah--
71733,L393649,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Paine.
71734,L393648,u2134,m139,DIZ,What dame?
71735,L393647,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--"
71736,L393646,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, ""Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--"" And he jumps right in and says, ""Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?"" He had me."
71737,L393645,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
71738,L393644,u2134,m139,DIZ,Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
71739,L393577,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,That's taking place outside now.
71740,L393576,u2134,m139,DIZ,Yeah. What about the second act?
71741,L393575,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Did you like the first act?
71742,L393559,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
71743,L393558,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Frankly, kid--are you goofy?"
71744,L393557,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,You play--left field.
71745,L393556,u2134,m139,DIZ,What do I play?
71746,L393555,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
71747,L393554,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Yes. Mostly ""Puss.""  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play."
71748,L393553,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots."
71749,L393552,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
71750,L393551,u2134,m139,DIZ,Who?
71751,L393550,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Ah. One of the supporting characters.
71752,L393548,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
71753,L393547,u2134,m139,DIZ,What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
71754,L393546,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute."
71755,L393186,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--!"
71756,L393185,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!"
71757,L393184,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
71758,L393183,u2134,m139,DIZ,Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
71759,L393173,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Whadaya mean--*right*?
71760,L393172,u2134,m139,DIZ,Will you go chase an ambulance!
71761,L393167,u2134,m139,DIZ,Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
71762,L393166,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!"
71763,L393103,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
71764,L393102,u2134,m139,DIZ,You know--little worms--ambition.
71765,L393101,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What! Who?
71766,L393100,u2134,m139,DIZ,You got worms.
71767,L393099,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks."
71768,L393098,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing."
71769,L393097,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--"
71770,L393096,u2134,m139,DIZ,I would cherish you--and stay sober.
71771,L393095,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Oh--that again. Yeah.
71772,L393094,u2134,m139,DIZ,You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
71773,L393093,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Huh?
71774,L393092,u2134,m139,DIZ,That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
71775,L393091,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"What's this, Diz?"
71776,L393090,u2134,m139,DIZ,Would you settle for a husband?
71777,L393089,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes."
71778,L393088,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Well, because you're doing all right at the minute."
71779,L393087,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Tell me why!
71780,L393083,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--"
71781,L393082,u2134,m139,DIZ,Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
71782,L393081,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?"
71783,L393080,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes."
71784,L393079,u2134,m139,DIZ,Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
71785,L393078,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?"
71786,L393077,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
71787,L393076,u2134,m139,DIZ,"Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?"
71788,L393055,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
71789,L393054,u2134,m139,DIZ,That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
71790,L393053,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
71791,L393050,u2134,m139,DIZ,No!
71792,L393049,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
71793,L392885,u2135,m139,EMMA,"Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith."
71794,L392884,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?"
71795,L392883,u2135,m139,EMMA,No wonder--without your dinner.
71796,L392882,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
71797,L392879,u2137,m139,HUBERT,That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
71798,L392878,u2135,m139,EMMA,Otis!
71799,L392862,u2135,m139,EMMA,"Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--"
71800,L392861,u2137,m139,HUBERT,I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
71801,L392843,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!"
71802,L392842,u2135,m139,EMMA,Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
71803,L392832,u2135,m139,EMMA,Nonsense.
71804,L392831,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing."
71805,L392830,u2135,m139,EMMA,"We're waiting, Hubert."
71806,L392829,u2137,m139,HUBERT,I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
71807,L392828,u2135,m139,EMMA,"Dinner, Hubert."
71808,L392765,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Now, pet--  Jim!"
71809,L392764,u2135,m139,EMMA,"Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!"
71810,L392763,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--"
71811,L392762,u2135,m139,EMMA,"This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!"
71812,L392761,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--"
71813,L392760,u2135,m139,EMMA,"Can't that wait, Hubert?"
71814,L392759,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Taylor, my dear."
71815,L392758,u2135,m139,EMMA,Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
71816,L392757,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
71817,L392756,u2135,m139,EMMA,Great saints!
71818,L392755,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Sam Foley--dead!
71819,L392754,u2135,m139,EMMA,What is it?
71820,L392753,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Yes, Joe, yes--right away."
71821,L392751,u2135,m139,EMMA,What is it?
71822,L392750,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!"
71823,L392749,u2135,m139,EMMA,That infernal phone!
71824,L392748,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?"
71825,L392747,u2135,m139,EMMA,I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
71826,L393030,u2144,m139,PAINE,Oh! Go away.
71827,L393029,u2136,m139,GRIFFITH,Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
71828,L393028,u2144,m139,PAINE,"All right, why?"
71829,L393027,u2136,m139,GRIFFITH,"How do you feel, champ?"
71830,L393026,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill."
71831,L393025,u2136,m139,GRIFFITH,"Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--"
71832,L393024,u2144,m139,PAINE,Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
71833,L393023,u2136,m139,GRIFFITH,"All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--"
71834,L393022,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Are you ready for him, Bill?"
71835,L392947,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--"
71836,L392946,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Oh--oh.
71837,L392943,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
71838,L392942,u2141,m139,MCGANN,He's batty!
71839,L392804,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
71840,L392803,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
71841,L392781,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two!
71842,L392780,u2141,m139,MCGANN,*You* tell Jim Taylor.
71843,L392779,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--"
71844,L392778,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait."
71845,L392777,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man."
71846,L393755,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"I doubt it! Come on, Ken."
71847,L393754,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Y-yes, Jim."
71848,L393753,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?"
71849,L393752,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Me! Jim--how--?
71850,L393751,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!"
71851,L393750,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
71852,L393749,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
71853,L392951,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Oh--Jim!
71854,L392950,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,*But you never asked me*!
71855,L392949,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--"
71856,L392948,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
71857,L392945,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!"
71858,L392944,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,What!
71859,L392941,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
71860,L392940,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
71861,L392821,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
71862,L392820,u2137,m139,HUBERT,I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
71863,L392819,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,*You won't?*
71864,L392818,u2137,m139,HUBERT,I *won't* send Horace Miller!
71865,L392817,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
71866,L392816,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--"
71867,L392815,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
71868,L392814,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--"
71869,L392813,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!"
71870,L392812,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Henry Hill.
71871,L392811,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,They put up *their* candidate? Who?
71872,L392806,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony."
71873,L392805,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick."
71874,L392802,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Horace Mill--!
71875,L392801,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!"
71876,L392800,u2137,m139,HUBERT,One minute! Just one minute!
71877,L392784,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Yes, Jim."
71878,L392783,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,You'll see those committees when we're finished!
71879,L392782,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!"
71880,L392934,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!"
71881,L392933,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"What were you saying, Governor? Sorry."
71882,L392931,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
71883,L392930,u2137,m139,HUBERT,The--head?
71884,L392929,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail."
71885,L392926,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Ma! Hold him!
71886,L392925,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--"
71887,L392924,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Aw--
71888,L392923,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
71889,L392904,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--""Boy Stuff""--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State."
71890,L392903,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun."
71891,L392902,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--"
71892,L392901,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--"
71893,L392900,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct."
71894,L392899,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--"
71895,L392898,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--"
71896,L392866,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!"
71897,L392865,u2145,m139,PETER,"""Boy Stuff."" That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--"
71898,L392857,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Himself!
71899,L392856,u2145,m139,PETER,"Well, Jeff put that out himself."
71900,L392855,u2137,m139,HUBERT,I did. What about it?
71901,L392851,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Oh, a *boy*!"
71902,L392850,u2145,m139,PETER,"Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!"
71903,L392834,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Is *what* getting me down?
71904,L392833,u2145,m139,PETER,"What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?"
71905,L393837,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Emma!
71906,L393836,u2143,m139,OTIS,A dirty frame!
71907,L392872,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Emma! Will you *please*--?
71908,L392871,u2143,m139,OTIS,Jeff for Senator.
71909,L392870,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Than what?
71910,L392869,u2143,m139,OTIS,"No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad."
71911,L392864,u2137,m139,HUBERT,What stuff?
71912,L392863,u2143,m139,OTIS,"He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' ""Boy Stuff's"" got the swellest stuff in it."
71913,L392928,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Uh--could--could I help--?
71914,L392927,u2140,m139,MA,"I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!"
71915,L392918,u2140,m139,MA,"Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--"
71916,L392917,u2137,m139,HUBERT,A pet shop?
71917,L392914,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Why, of course."
71918,L392913,u2140,m139,MA,"Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg."
71919,L392906,u2137,m139,HUBERT,"Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--"
71920,L392905,u2140,m139,MA,Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
71921,L392893,u2140,m139,MA,Certainly. Step right in.
71922,L392892,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
71923,L392891,u2140,m139,MA,Yes. Come in.
71924,L392890,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
71925,L392889,u2140,m139,MA,I *thought* I heard... Yes?
71926,L394041,u2137,m139,HUBERT,When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
71927,L394040,u2139,m139,JIMMIE,"When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--"
71928,L392845,u2137,m139,HUBERT,I beg your pardon?
71929,L392844,u2139,m139,JIMMIE,That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
71930,L392841,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
71931,L392840,u2139,m139,JIMMIE,"Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?"
71932,L392839,u2137,m139,HUBERT,Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
71933,L392838,u2139,m139,JIMMIE,"Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!"
71934,L393744,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
71935,L393743,u2141,m139,MCGANN,What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
71936,L393742,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
71937,L393395,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot."
71938,L393394,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
71939,L393393,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders."
71940,L393392,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--"
71941,L393391,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann."
71942,L393033,u2141,m139,MCGANN,What? Who?
71943,L393032,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Look! There it is!
71944,L393031,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--"
71945,L392990,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator."
71946,L392989,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
71947,L392986,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
71948,L392985,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Just a minute, I better make sure."
71949,L392984,u2141,m139,MCGANN,The porter's got them. They're coming.
71950,L392983,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
71951,L392982,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington."
71952,L392981,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Washington!
71953,L394108,u2148,m139,SENATOR,"In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?"
71954,L394107,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I yield.
71955,L394106,u2148,m139,SENATOR,Will the Senator yield for a question?
71956,L394020,u2148,m139,SENATOR,Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
71957,L394019,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,For one week!
71958,L394018,u2148,m139,SENATOR,Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
71959,L394017,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,For a question!
71960,L394016,u2148,m139,SENATOR,Will the Senator yield?
71961,L393963,u2148,m139,SENATOR,I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
71962,L393962,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I addressed the Chair first, sir!"
71963,L393961,u2148,m139,SENATOR,Mr. President!
71964,L393960,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Mr. President!
71965,L393861,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
71966,L393860,u2148,m139,SENATOR,Where were you?
71967,L394185,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!"
71968,L394184,u2144,m139,PAINE,"No, Jeff--please--!"
71969,L394183,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Please, sir!--come with me!"
71970,L394164,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?"
71971,L394163,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, sir, you bet I would."
71972,L394161,u2144,m139,PAINE,"The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?"
71973,L394160,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, sir, I yield for a question."
71974,L394003,u2144,m139,PAINE,I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
71975,L394002,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--"
71976,L394001,u2144,m139,PAINE,He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
71977,L394000,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Mr. President--
71978,L393997,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Mr. President--
71979,L393996,u2144,m139,PAINE,Mr. President! A point of order!
71980,L393995,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--"
71981,L393994,u2144,m139,PAINE,Will the Senator--
71982,L393990,u2144,m139,PAINE,The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
71983,L393989,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I have no defense against forged papers and--
71984,L393988,u2144,m139,PAINE,I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
71985,L393987,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Mr. President--
71986,L393986,u2144,m139,PAINE,Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
71987,L393985,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,It does!
71988,L393984,u2144,m139,PAINE,Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
71989,L393983,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,For a *question*.
71990,L393982,u2144,m139,PAINE,Will he *yield*?
71991,L393981,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Ah, now, that's better."
71992,L393980,u2144,m139,PAINE,Will he yield for a question?
71993,L393979,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yield *how*, sir?"
71994,L393827,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!"
71995,L393826,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Y-yes.
71996,L393741,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
71997,L393740,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
71998,L393739,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--"
71999,L393738,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
72000,L393737,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--"
72001,L393379,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Goodnight, Miss Paine."
72002,L393378,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Goodnight, Jeff."
72003,L393377,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Well--goodnight.
72004,L393376,u2144,m139,PAINE,Good as new! It's quite all right--
72005,L393375,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--"
72006,L393374,u2144,m139,PAINE,"That's all right, my boy--don't bother--"
72007,L393373,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
72008,L393358,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--"
72009,L393357,u2144,m139,PAINE,Here--where are you running off to?
72010,L393356,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time."
72011,L393355,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Nonsense, Jeff."
72012,L393354,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--"
72013,L393353,u2144,m139,PAINE,What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
72014,L393352,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--"
72015,L393351,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--"
72016,L393350,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, I was--"
72017,L393349,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?"
72018,L393348,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir."
72019,L393347,u2144,m139,PAINE,"The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--"
72020,L393346,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--"
72021,L392980,u2144,m139,PAINE,No.
72022,L392979,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?"
72023,L392978,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on..."
72024,L392977,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning..."
72025,L392976,u2144,m139,PAINE,"His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--"
72026,L392975,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
72027,L392974,u2144,m139,PAINE,"You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us."
72028,L392973,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes."
72029,L392972,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes."
72030,L392971,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Thank you, sir."
72031,L392970,u2144,m139,PAINE,"""Boy Stuff."" Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father."
72032,L392969,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's."
72033,L394193,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,We'd better see.
72034,L394192,u2140,m139,MA,Just fine.
72035,L394191,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"How's Amos, Ma?"
72036,L394190,u2140,m139,MA,"Certainly would, Joseph."
72037,L394189,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--"
72038,L394188,u2140,m139,MA,Fine--
72039,L394187,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--"
72040,L394186,u2140,m139,MA,"Hello, Jefferson."
72041,L392936,u2140,m139,MA,What?
72042,L392935,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Now, Amos, now--  What?"
72043,L392922,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Sorry about this, Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room, sir--"
72044,L392921,u2140,m139,MA,Satan's in this little fella tonight!
72045,L392920,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!"
72046,L392916,u2140,m139,MA,"Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor."
72047,L392915,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!"
72048,L392911,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--"
72049,L392910,u2140,m139,MA,"Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son."
72050,L392909,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, Ma?"
72051,L392908,u2140,m139,MA,Jefferson--
72052,L392907,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh, now--"
72053,L392896,u2140,m139,MA,Well--I'll go to Halifax!
72054,L392895,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!"
72055,L393798,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,You're a liar!
72056,L393797,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
72057,L393796,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
72058,L393795,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Can't you?
72059,L393788,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life."
72060,L393787,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?"
72061,L393786,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--"
72062,L393785,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--"
72063,L393784,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
72064,L393783,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Like what, Mr. Taylor?"
72065,L393782,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--"
72066,L394195,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
72067,L394194,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
72068,L393943,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"To a hard night's work, son. Come on!"
72069,L393942,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Where do we go from here?
72070,L393941,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Hurray!
72071,L393940,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yay!
72072,L393939,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!"
72073,L393938,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Saunders--if there was *any* way--
72074,L393937,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--"
72075,L393936,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Oh--Saunders--
72076,L393935,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!"
72077,L393934,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,But--I've done everything I--
72078,L393933,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What you *have* to do is fight!
72079,L393932,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Wait--
72080,L393931,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
72081,L393930,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--"
72082,L393929,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well, I guess it's a chance."
72083,L393928,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
72084,L393927,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way."
72085,L393925,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
72086,L393924,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What are you going to do?
72087,L393923,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
72088,L393922,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--"
72089,L393921,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I'm not.
72090,L393920,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--"
72091,L393919,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Saunders--
72092,L393918,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Hello.
72093,L393728,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Are you drunk?
72094,L393727,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
72095,L393726,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Saunders--!
72096,L393725,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--""Thank you, Mr. Smith."" Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!"
72097,L393630,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Wow!
72098,L393629,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--"
72099,L393628,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !"
72100,L393627,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
72101,L393616,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--"
72102,L393615,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Don't mention it--
72103,L393614,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
72104,L393613,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Oh--*Saunders*!
72105,L393612,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Thanks a lot.
72106,L393611,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
72107,L393610,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Do you want to dictate them?
72108,L393609,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate!"
72109,L393608,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Not another bill?
72110,L393607,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
72111,L393606,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Second drawer.
72112,L393605,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--""Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents."" Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. ""Yours truly, Stinky Moore."" Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?"
72113,L393604,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country."
72114,L393603,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Already? All these letters?
72115,L393602,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
72116,L393601,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
72117,L393600,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Must have been tickled pink.
72118,L393599,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
72119,L393598,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Great.
72120,L393597,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?"
72121,L393596,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?"
72122,L393595,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,What do they--? Who are all those--?
72123,L393544,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
72124,L393543,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  ""--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"""
72125,L393542,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Well--no. I didn't. Why?
72126,L393541,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?"
72127,L393540,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said."
72128,L393539,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No--
72129,L393538,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"You--don't know it, do you?"
72130,L393537,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,In Terry Canyon?
72131,L393536,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
72132,L393532,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--"
72133,L393531,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?"
72134,L393530,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
72135,L393529,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--"
72136,L393528,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--"
72137,L393527,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,You win. It's--Clarissa.
72138,L393526,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I've got more. You better tell me.
72139,L393525,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No! Stop it!
72140,L393524,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Lena.
72141,L393523,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No!
72142,L393522,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Letitia.
72143,L393521,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No!
72144,L393520,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Abigail.
72145,L393519,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,It *is* not!
72146,L393518,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I know. It's--Violet.
72147,L393517,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well, if it's all the same to you--"
72148,L393516,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
72149,L393515,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Look--I think we ought to skip it.
72150,L393514,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?"
72151,L393513,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I also answer to whistles.
72152,L393512,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
72153,L393511,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Why?
72154,L393510,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got ""Saunders"" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?"
72155,L393509,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Terrible, thank you."
72156,L393508,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?"
72157,L393507,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Go right ahead.
72158,L393506,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain ""Saunders."" Why can't I?"
72159,L393505,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I don't see where we are *with* it.
72160,L393504,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
72161,L393503,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Have I?
72162,L393502,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
72163,L393501,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No complaints.
72164,L393500,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"It hasn't been easy, has it?"
72165,L393499,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?"
72166,L393498,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
72167,L393497,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Since sixteen or so.
72168,L393496,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Have you always had to--work?
72169,L393495,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
72170,L393494,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
72171,L393493,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
72172,L393492,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,You mean--here?
72173,L393489,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
72174,L393488,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No.
72175,L393487,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?"
72176,L393486,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--"
72177,L393485,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, yes--"
72178,L393484,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Uh--getting back to this, Senator--"
72179,L393483,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
72180,L393482,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,He did?
72181,L393481,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know."
72182,L393480,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
72183,L393479,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well--gosh--that--that isn't ""particulars,"" is it?"
72184,L393477,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading ""land of the free"" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: ""I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."""
72185,L393476,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,On paper?
72186,L393473,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--"
72187,L393472,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--"
72188,L393471,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I did--and--and I got right up.
72189,L393470,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Try sitting down.
72190,L393469,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
72191,L393468,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Yes, Senator--*twice*."
72192,L393467,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?"
72193,L393451,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,And a *lot* of paper!
72194,L393450,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Thanks very much.
72195,L393449,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders."
72196,L393448,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
72197,L393447,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I said--shall we get started *now* or--
72198,L393446,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Pardon?
72199,L393445,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
72200,L393444,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?"
72201,L393443,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,We're over in the House.
72202,L393442,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
72203,L393441,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,*This* is.
72204,L393440,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
72205,L393439,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
72206,L393438,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
72207,L393437,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,The Steering Committee.
72208,L393436,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What?
72209,L393435,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,What's that?
72210,L393434,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
72211,L393433,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Calendar?
72212,L393432,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--"
72213,L393431,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Some committee's got it.
72214,L393430,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Good. Where are we?
72215,L393429,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, I see that."
72216,L393428,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
72217,L393427,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Why?
72218,L393426,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
72219,L393425,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Why?
72220,L393424,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Committee.
72221,L393423,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Committee, huh?"
72222,L393422,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
72223,L393421,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,How?
72224,L393420,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--"
72225,L393419,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--"
72226,L393418,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!"
72227,L393417,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Tonight.
72228,L393416,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,A *day*!
72229,L393415,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh, just a day--"
72230,L393414,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--"
72231,L393413,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,And with your help--
72232,L393412,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I see. *This* one is so simple--
72233,L393411,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh, but this one is so simple."
72234,L393410,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--"
72235,L393409,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Right.
72236,L393408,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?"
72237,L393407,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I know--but you--you're going to help.
72238,L393406,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?"
72239,L393405,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
72240,L393404,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
72241,L393403,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
72242,L393402,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?"
72243,L393401,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp..."
72244,L393400,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,We're going right ahead with--*what*?
72245,L393399,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!"
72246,L393398,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
72247,L393397,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Punch?
72248,L393396,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Go ahead--punch.
72249,L393153,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
72250,L393152,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,You *couldn't*?
72251,L393151,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"No, gee--I couldn't stay here--"
72252,L393147,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
72253,L393146,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
72254,L393145,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No. What had you better--?
72255,L393144,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
72256,L393143,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
72257,L393142,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
72258,L393141,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Convene?
72259,L393140,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?"
72260,L393139,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out."
72261,L393138,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
72262,L393137,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
72263,L393136,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Whose statue is that?
72264,L393135,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
72265,L393134,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there."
72266,L393133,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Well--he's got nothing on me.
72267,L393132,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--"
72268,L393131,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Most natural thing in the world!
72269,L393130,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
72270,L393129,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
72271,L393128,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,There *what* was?
72272,L393127,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--"
72273,L393126,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Did you say--bus?
72274,L393125,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--"
72275,L393121,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Pleased to meet you, sir."
72276,L393120,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore."
72277,L393119,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?"
72278,L393118,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--"
72279,L393117,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Is--is something the matter?
72280,L393113,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,J-Jefferson Smith.
72281,L393112,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What's your name?
72282,L393110,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No!
72283,L393109,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,The man downstairs said number--
72284,L393108,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,*No*!
72285,L393107,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Office of--Senator Smith?
72286,L393106,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What is it?
72287,L393332,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
72288,L393331,u2152,m139,VOICES,"Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that."
72289,L393321,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,That's what I said--the *truth*!
72290,L393320,u2152,m139,VOICES,"The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! ""What *is* truth?"" asked so-and-so, and turned away!"
72291,L393319,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
72292,L393214,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
72293,L393213,u2152,m139,VOICES,A camp! Well!
72294,L393212,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
72295,L393211,u2152,m139,VOICES,Ah! That's more like it! What?
72296,L393200,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--"
72297,L393199,u2152,m139,VOICES,"Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?"
72298,L393643,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!"
72299,L393642,u2150,m139,SUSAN,You're not going to take your *suit* off!
72300,L393641,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: ""Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear."" ""Not the collar, Mary,"" he said, ""my shoes."" ""Well, for land's sake,"" Ma said, ""Take the pesky things off!"" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week."
72301,L393640,u2150,m139,SUSAN,Well--I--
72302,L393639,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
72303,L393638,u2150,m139,SUSAN,Well! You don't say!
72304,L393637,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new."
72305,L393636,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"And how's your bill, Senator?"
72306,L393635,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,That's--that's splendid.
72307,L393634,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"I'm splendid, too."
72308,L393633,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
72309,L393632,u2150,m139,SUSAN,Splendid.
72310,L393631,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?"
72311,L393370,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"Goodnight, Senator--"
72312,L393369,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--"
72313,L393368,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,No--I mean--yes--that is--
72314,L393367,u2150,m139,SUSAN,Then you *did* say it.
72315,L393366,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Oh--you are!
72316,L393365,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful."
72317,L393364,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that."
72318,L393363,u2150,m139,SUSAN,How are the pigeons?
72319,L393362,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--"
72320,L393019,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father."
72321,L393018,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Sure.
72322,L393004,u2150,m139,SUSAN,Wonderful!
72323,L393003,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals."
72324,L394110,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair."
72325,L394109,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?"
72326,L394101,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
72327,L394100,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"""--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--""  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on."
72328,L394032,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Ring the call to quorum.
72329,L394031,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. ""If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--,"" and that begins to look like me--""may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators.""  Mr. President--*I so direct*."
72330,L393992,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!"
72331,L393991,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"Order, gentlemen!"
72332,L393966,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!"
72333,L393965,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"You were about to recognize me, sir--"
72334,L393964,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--"
72335,L393820,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Yes, sir--"
72336,L393819,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
72337,L393565,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--"
72338,L393564,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith."
72339,L393313,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"Senator, you can talk all you want to, now."
72340,L393312,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"""So help me God."""
72341,L393311,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"""I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."""
72342,L393307,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
72343,L393306,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--"
72344,L393067,u2149,m139,SPIELER,"Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry."
72345,L393066,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
72346,L393065,u2149,m139,SPIELER,Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
72347,L393064,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
72348,L393063,u2149,m139,SPIELER,"How's that, buddy?"
72349,L393062,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
72350,L393223,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Well--I can *manage*--
72351,L393222,u2142,m139,NOSEY,Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
72352,L393217,u2142,m139,NOSEY,Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
72353,L393216,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,"Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--"
72354,L393215,u2142,m139,NOSEY,Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
72355,L393210,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Well--I have got *one* idea--
72356,L393209,u2142,m139,NOSEY,"A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?"
72357,L393208,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Ax?
72358,L393203,u2142,m139,NOSEY,Swell!
72359,L393202,u2138,m139,JEFFERSON,Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
72360,L393201,u2142,m139,NOSEY,"One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?"
72361,L393457,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann--"
72362,L393456,u2141,m139,MCGANN,What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
72363,L393455,u2141,m139,MCGANN,A Bill! Not *him*!
72364,L393454,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,The Head Man's writing a Bill.
72365,L393453,u2141,m139,MCGANN,What do you mean? What's going on?
72366,L393452,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,I wouldn't wait if I were you.
72367,L393390,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--"
72368,L393389,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute."
72369,L393388,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
72370,L393387,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
72371,L393386,u2141,m139,MCGANN,What! Who?
72372,L393385,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,How'd you like a punch in the nose?
72373,L393384,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
72374,L393881,u2144,m139,PAINE,Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
72375,L393880,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!"
72376,L393760,u2144,m139,PAINE,--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
72377,L393759,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
72378,L393758,u2144,m139,PAINE,--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
72379,L393592,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
72380,L393591,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
72381,L393590,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor."
72382,L393589,u2144,m139,PAINE,My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
72383,L393588,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Susan!
72384,L393587,u2144,m139,PAINE,"That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid."
72385,L393586,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
72386,L393585,u2144,m139,PAINE,I know that.
72387,L393584,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
72388,L393583,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow."
72389,L393582,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--"
72390,L393581,u2144,m139,PAINE,--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
72391,L393580,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"That's dynamite, Joe!"
72392,L393579,u2144,m139,PAINE,Let's get away from here.
72393,L393578,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
72394,L393465,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight."
72395,L393464,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Joe! You *told* him to!
72396,L393460,u2144,m139,PAINE,What's the matter?
72397,L393459,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Joe--drop everything and come with me!
72398,L393163,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--"
72399,L393162,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--"
72400,L393021,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along."
72401,L393020,u2144,m139,PAINE,Chick--
72402,L393010,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
72403,L393009,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!"
72404,L392997,u2141,m139,MCGANN,"Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine."
72405,L392996,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!"
72406,L392988,u2141,m139,MCGANN,Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
72407,L392987,u2144,m139,PAINE,"You can't find it in racing forms, Chick."
72408,L393182,u2142,m139,NOSEY,Okay. See you here.
72409,L393181,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!"
72410,L393180,u2142,m139,NOSEY,Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
72411,L393179,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?"
72412,L393175,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well, well!"
72413,L393174,u2142,m139,NOSEY,"What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!"
72414,L393171,u2142,m139,NOSEY,Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
72415,L393170,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Go away, Nosey."
72416,L393169,u2142,m139,NOSEY,"Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!"
72417,L394175,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,He did it.
72418,L394174,u2144,m139,PAINE,Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
72419,L393910,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!"
72420,L393909,u2144,m139,PAINE,It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
72421,L393908,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!"
72422,L393907,u2144,m139,PAINE,"I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--"
72423,L393906,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
72424,L393905,u2144,m139,PAINE,Do you?
72425,L393904,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What are you talking about? What difference--?
72426,L393903,u2144,m139,PAINE,"But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?"
72427,L393902,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well--me, too!"
72428,L393901,u2144,m139,PAINE,He's lost complete faith in me--
72429,L393900,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Why don't you do it yourself?
72430,L393899,u2144,m139,PAINE,Yes--
72431,L393898,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
72432,L393897,u2144,m139,PAINE,Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
72433,L393896,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"What do you want, Senator?"
72434,L393261,u2144,m139,PAINE,I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
72435,L393260,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--"
72436,L393259,u2144,m139,PAINE,What do you mean?
72437,L393258,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yeah?  And what else?
72438,L393257,u2144,m139,PAINE,"You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington."
72439,L393256,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
72440,L393255,u2144,m139,PAINE,"You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--"
72441,L393254,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
72442,L393253,u2144,m139,PAINE,"You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--"
72443,L393252,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No?
72444,L393251,u2144,m139,PAINE,I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
72445,L393250,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Nice *compliment*!
72446,L393249,u2144,m139,PAINE,You're the best nurse I can think of--
72447,L393248,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--"
72448,L393247,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Oh, now--that won't do--"
72449,L393246,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,That's right.
72450,L393245,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--"
72451,L393244,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
72452,L393243,u2144,m139,PAINE,"By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?"
72453,L393242,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
72454,L393241,u2144,m139,PAINE,No?
72455,L393240,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
72456,L393239,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?"
72457,L393238,u2147,m139,SAUNDERS,"You want to see me, Senator?"
72458,L394053,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!"
72459,L394052,u2144,m139,PAINE,I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
72460,L394051,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
72461,L394050,u2144,m139,PAINE,And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
72462,L394049,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
72463,L394048,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
72464,L393884,u2144,m139,PAINE,No--I--I'll take a walk--
72465,L393883,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
72466,L393807,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"But--if he *does*, Joe--"
72467,L393806,u2144,m139,PAINE,Maybe he won't get up.
72468,L393805,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Anything *better* to offer?
72469,L393804,u2144,m139,PAINE,It's crucifying him--!
72470,L393803,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--"
72471,L393792,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
72472,L393791,u2144,m139,PAINE,You can't say *that* to--
72473,L393790,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Just a minute, Joe!"
72474,L393789,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jim!
72475,L393779,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--"
72476,L393778,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--"
72477,L393777,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
72478,L393775,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in."
72479,L393774,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him."
72480,L393773,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home."
72481,L393772,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Jim, you don't have to--"
72482,L393771,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together."
72483,L393770,u2144,m139,PAINE,I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
72484,L393769,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,You won't stand for it?
72485,L393768,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Jim, I won't stand for it."
72486,L393767,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces."
72487,L393766,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him."
72488,L393765,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?"
72489,L393764,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington."
72490,L393763,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,What do you think?
72491,L393762,u2144,m139,PAINE,Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
72492,L393761,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,That's him. Let him in.
72493,L392955,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
72494,L392954,u2144,m139,PAINE,A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
72495,L392953,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
72496,L392952,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home."
72497,L392798,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
72498,L392797,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders."
72499,L392796,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with."
72500,L392795,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
72501,L392794,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street."
72502,L392793,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,"Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--"
72503,L392792,u2144,m139,PAINE,"I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?"
72504,L392791,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
72505,L392790,u2144,m139,PAINE,"How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?"
72506,L392789,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
72507,L392788,u2144,m139,PAINE,Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
72508,L392787,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
72509,L392786,u2144,m139,PAINE,"--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him."
72510,L392785,u2151,m139,TAYLOR,That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
72511,L393383,u2144,m139,PAINE,And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
72512,L393382,u2150,m139,SUSAN,What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
72513,L393381,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest."
72514,L393361,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"How nice. How do you do, Senator?"
72515,L393360,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan."
72516,L393359,u2150,m139,SUSAN,Father--oh.
72517,L393237,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"Listen, Father! ""Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine""!"
72518,L393236,u2144,m139,PAINE,Do I actually *see* this--?
72519,L393235,u2150,m139,SUSAN,Such pretty knees for a big boy!
72520,L393234,u2144,m139,PAINE,His first 'whiff'!
72521,L393017,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons."
72522,L393016,u2144,m139,PAINE,"All right, we'll take Jeff with us--"
72523,L393015,u2150,m139,SUSAN,How nice.
72524,L392993,u2150,m139,SUSAN,"I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund."
72525,L392992,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator."
72526,L394166,u2144,m139,PAINE,Page boys!
72527,L394165,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,"Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator."
72528,L394159,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
72529,L394158,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?"
72530,L394009,u2144,m139,PAINE,"Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!"
72531,L394008,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Order!
72532,L394006,u2144,m139,PAINE,--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
72533,L394005,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Order!
72534,L394004,u2144,m139,PAINE,"I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !"
72535,L393999,u2144,m139,PAINE,It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
72536,L393998,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Senator Paine will state it!
72537,L393978,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
72538,L393977,u2144,m139,PAINE,Will the Senator yield?
72539,L393973,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Will Senator Smith yield to--?
72540,L393972,u2144,m139,PAINE,Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
72541,L393294,u2144,m139,PAINE,I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
72542,L393293,u2146,m139,PRESIDENT,Senator Paine.
72543,L393292,u2144,m139,PAINE,Mr. President...
72544,L395401,u2153,m140,2ND BODYGUARD,Certainly.
72545,L395400,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?

72547,L395396,u2153,m140,2ND BODYGUARD,Some people like it.
72548,L395395,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That's going to be fun.
72549,L395390,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
72550,L395389,u2153,m140,2ND BODYGUARD,"Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what."
72551,L395386,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Who are you?
72552,L395385,u2153,m140,2ND BODYGUARD,No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
72553,L395040,u2154,m140,AGENT,"Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody."
72554,L395039,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
72555,L395038,u2154,m140,AGENT,Who's that?
72556,L395037,u2162,m140,CEDAR,We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
72557,L395035,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Yes, I"
72558,L395034,u2154,m140,AGENT,"Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds."
72559,L395033,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Yes.
72560,L395032,u2154,m140,AGENT,Deeds?
72561,L395031,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?"

72563,L395028,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Good morning.
72564,L396357,u2155,m140,AMY,He sure is.
72565,L396356,u2171,m140,JANE,He's still pixilated.
72566,L396323,u2155,m140,AMY,"Yes, indeedy."
72567,L396322,u2171,m140,JANE,"Oh, yes."
72568,L396318,u2155,m140,AMY,Uh-huh.
72569,L396317,u2171,m140,JANE,"Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us."
72570,L396315,u2155,m140,AMY,Always.
72571,L396314,u2171,m140,JANE,"Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow."
72572,L396306,u2155,m140,AMY,"Yes, you own it."
72573,L396305,u2171,m140,JANE,"Why, you own it, Longfellow."
72574,L396200,u2155,m140,AMY,"Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right."
72575,L396199,u2171,m140,JANE,He sure is pixilated.
72576,L396198,u2155,m140,AMY,Never can tell what he's going to do.
72577,L396197,u2171,m140,JANE,"For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming."
72578,L396192,u2171,m140,JANE,And sings.
72579,L396191,u2155,m140,AMY,Sometimes he whistles.
72580,L396190,u2171,m140,JANE,"He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself."
72581,L396183,u2155,m140,AMY,Uh-huh.
72582,L396182,u2171,m140,JANE,Pixilated.
72583,L396179,u2155,m140,AMY,"Oh yes, pixilated."
72584,L396178,u2171,m140,JANE,They think he's pixilated.
72585,L396175,u2155,m140,AMY,Sometimes twice.
72586,L396174,u2171,m140,JANE,Most every day.
72587,L396172,u2171,m140,JANE,He was a seven-months baby.
72588,L396171,u2155,m140,AMY,Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
72589,L396170,u2171,m140,JANE,Since he was born.

72591,L395997,u2156,m140,APPLICANT,Thank you very much.
72592,L395996,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions."
72593,L395995,u2156,m140,APPLICANT,"No, no children."

72597,L395834,u2157,m140,BABE,Would you like to go for a walk?
72598,L395833,u2174,m140,LONGFELLOW'S VOICE,I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
72599,L395695,u2157,m140,BABE,Why not?
72600,L395694,u2174,m140,LONGFELLOW'S VOICE,I haven't.
72601,L395693,u2157,m140,BABE,"You don't go out with girls very much, do you?"
72602,L395692,u2174,m140,LONGFELLOW'S VOICE,No.
72603,L395691,u2157,m140,BABE,No. Are you?

72605,L396262,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"You are , aren't you?"
72606,L396261,u2157,m140,BABE,What's that got to do with it?
72607,L396260,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?"
72608,L396259,u2157,m140,BABE,What's that got to do with it?
72609,L396258,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him."
72610,L396250,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object."
72611,L396249,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, thank you!"
72612,L396149,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all."
72613,L396148,u2157,m140,BABE,It isn't all! I'd like to explain
72614,L396147,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"That's all, Miss Bennett."
72615,L396146,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yes, but I"
72616,L396145,u2162,m140,CEDAR,And you saw them happen?
72617,L396144,u2157,m140,BABE,They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
72618,L396143,u2162,m140,CEDAR,But they did take place?
72619,L396142,u2157,m140,BABE,NO!!
72620,L396141,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Are they true!
72621,L396140,u2157,m140,BABE,Yes!
72622,L396139,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Were you present when all these things took place?
72623,L396138,u2157,m140,BABE,Yes!
72624,L396137,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Are these the articles?
72625,L396136,u2157,m140,BABE,Yes!
72626,L396135,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
72627,L396134,u2157,m140,BABE,Yes.
72628,L396133,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
72629,L396130,u2157,m140,BABE,No! I resigned last week!
72630,L396129,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?"
72631,L396128,u2157,m140,BABE,No!
72632,L396127,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?"
72633,L396125,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Your Honor!
72634,L396124,u2157,m140,BABE,It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
72635,L395948,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, hello darling."
72636,L395947,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Hello, Mary?"
72637,L395870,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yes, of course."
72638,L395869,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Would you like to read it? It's to you.
72639,L395865,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Mary - I - excuse me
72640,L395864,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yes, here we are again.  Good night."
72641,L395863,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, here we are again."
72642,L395861,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it."
72643,L395860,u2157,m140,BABE,A girl?
72644,L395859,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl."
72645,L395858,u2157,m140,BABE,"No, I don't mind."
72646,L395857,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me."
72647,L395855,u2157,m140,BABE,I don't blame you.
72648,L395854,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"In a day or so, I think."
72649,L395853,u2157,m140,BABE,Are you? When?
72650,L395852,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Mary, I'm going home."
72651,L395851,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,All right.
72652,L395850,u2157,m140,BABE,"Let's just walk, okay?"
72653,L395849,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you."
72654,L395843,u2157,m140,BABE,Thank you.
72655,L395842,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Gosh, she looks better every time I see her."
72656,L395841,u2157,m140,BABE,Ready?
72657,L395836,u2157,m140,BABE,I'll get my hat.
72658,L395835,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Yes, if it isn't too late."
72659,L395829,u2157,m140,BABE,You threw them out!
72660,L395828,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!"
72661,L395827,u2157,m140,BABE,I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
72662,L395745,u2157,m140,BABE,I'd like to read it some time.
72663,L395744,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
72664,L395743,u2157,m140,BABE,"Well, that's very nice. Thank you."
72665,L395742,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met."
72666,L395741,u2157,m140,BABE,No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
72667,L395740,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
72668,L395721,u2157,m140,BABE,It had better be good.
72669,L395720,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do ""Humoresque"" with you."
72670,L395719,u2157,m140,BABE,"""Humoresque""? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes."
72671,L395718,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Sure. I can sing ""Humoresque."""
72672,L395717,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, I suppose you could do better."
72673,L395716,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Sure!
72674,L395715,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yes. I can do ""Swanee River."" Would you like to hear me?"
72675,L395714,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,He did?
72676,L395713,u2157,m140,BABE,The drums. He taught me to play some.
72677,L395712,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What did he play?
72678,L395711,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yeah, I know."
72679,L395710,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,He did? I play the tuba
72680,L395709,u2157,m140,BABE,"He played in the town band, too."
72681,L395708,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
72682,L395707,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: ""No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."""
72683,L395706,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,You have?
72684,L395705,u2157,m140,BABE,I've often thought about going back.
72685,L395703,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Gosh! What do you know about that!
72686,L395702,u2157,m140,BABE,Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
72687,L395701,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Really?
72688,L395700,u2157,m140,BABE,"I'm from a small town too, you know."
72689,L395699,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
72690,L395698,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them."
72691,L395697,u2157,m140,BABE,You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
72692,L395696,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, I don't know."
72693,L395689,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Nothing
72694,L395688,u2157,m140,BABE,What did you mean by that?
72695,L395687,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, that"
72696,L395686,u2157,m140,BABE,You said I was a lady in distress.
72697,L395685,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What's that?
72698,L395684,u2157,m140,BABE,"You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal."
72699,L395683,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around."
72700,L395682,u2157,m140,BABE,Here's a nice place.
72701,L395680,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?"
72702,L395679,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know."
72703,L395678,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?"
72704,L395677,u2157,m140,BABE,"You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?"
72705,L395675,u2157,m140,BABE,Why don't you try?
72706,L395674,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"You can almost spit on it, can't you?"
72707,L395673,u2157,m140,BABE,There's Times Square.
72708,L395648,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America."
72709,L395647,u2157,m140,BABE,"Now, what do you see?"
72710,L395646,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That depends on what they see.
72711,L395645,u2157,m140,BABE,"I say, to most people it's a washout."
72712,L395644,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Huh?
72713,L395643,u2157,m140,BABE,"To most people, it's an awful letdown."
72714,L395642,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,It's wonderful.
72715,L395641,u2157,m140,BABE,There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
72716,L395635,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yeah, let's."
72717,L395634,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Yes.
72718,L395633,u2157,m140,BABE,Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
72719,L395631,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
72720,L395630,u2157,m140,BABE,Uh-huh.
72721,L395629,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Have you seen the papers?
72722,L395624,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Do you always wear your hair like that?
72723,L395623,u2157,m140,BABE,What are they going to do?
72724,L395622,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
72725,L395621,u2157,m140,BABE,What did they say?
72726,L395620,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Gosh, you look pretty tonight."
72727,L395619,u2157,m140,BABE,What did they say?
72728,L395618,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
72729,L395615,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if"
72730,L395614,u2157,m140,BABE,Oh. What's happening about the opera?
72731,L395613,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Sure. I met you.
72732,L395606,u2157,m140,BABE,"Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of."
72733,L395605,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do."
72734,L395604,u2157,m140,BABE,I enjoy it.
72735,L395603,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
72736,L395497,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, I don't mind."
72737,L395496,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together."
72738,L395448,u2157,m140,BABE,Really?
72739,L395447,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Look - there's Brookfield, the poet."
72740,L395443,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep."
72741,L395442,u2157,m140,BABE,"You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?"
72742,L395432,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Oh - uh - nothing.
72743,L395431,u2157,m140,BABE,What?
72744,L395430,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"You were a lady in distress, weren't you?"
72745,L395429,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you."
72746,L395428,u2157,m140,BABE,"Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody."
72747,L395427,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Tell me more about yourself.
72748,L395426,u2157,m140,BABE,"Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you."
72749,L395425,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Feel better now?
72750,L395420,u2157,m140,BABE,"Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much."
72751,L395419,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What happened?
72752,L395418,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, no, really - I'll be all right."
72753,L395417,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Look, this is my house. I'd like to"
72754,L395416,u2157,m140,BABE,"No, thank you. I'll be all right."
72755,L395413,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . ."
72756,L395412,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,You fainted.
72757,L395825,u2157,m140,BABE,Hello.
72758,L395824,u2175,m140,MABEL,Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
72759,L395810,u2157,m140,BABE,We're not going out tonight.
72760,L395809,u2175,m140,MABEL,"Just a minute. No, you don't."
72761,L395802,u2157,m140,BABE,What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
72762,L395801,u2175,m140,MABEL,You're acting like a school girl.
72763,L395800,u2157,m140,BABE,Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
72764,L395799,u2175,m140,MABEL,What'll I tell him if he calls up?
72765,L395798,u2175,m140,MABEL,Running away is no solution.
72766,L395797,u2157,m140,BABE,I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
72767,L395796,u2175,m140,MABEL,"You're a fool, Babe."
72768,L395762,u2157,m140,BABE,No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
72769,L395761,u2175,m140,MABEL,Huh?
72770,L395760,u2157,m140,BABE,"He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?"
72771,L395759,u2175,m140,MABEL,"Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again."
72772,L395758,u2157,m140,BABE,"Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat."
72773,L395757,u2175,m140,MABEL,The guy's balmy.
72774,L395756,u2157,m140,BABE,Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
72775,L395755,u2175,m140,MABEL,Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
72776,L395754,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yeah, then what?"
72777,L395753,u2175,m140,MABEL,"You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?"
72778,L395752,u2157,m140,BABE,Why? Why do we have to do it?
72779,L395751,u2175,m140,MABEL,People have been crucified before.
72780,L395750,u2157,m140,BABE,I'm crucifying him.
72781,L395749,u2175,m140,MABEL,Uh-huh.
72782,L395748,u2157,m140,BABE,"Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out."
72783,L395747,u2157,m140,BABE,Good night.
72784,L395736,u2157,m140,BABE,"I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me."
72785,L395735,u2175,m140,MABEL,"You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us."
72786,L395734,u2157,m140,BABE,Don't be ridiculous.
72787,L395733,u2175,m140,MABEL,My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
72788,L395732,u2157,m140,BABE,No. It's nothing.
72789,L395731,u2175,m140,MABEL,"What's up, Babe? Something's eating you."
72790,L395730,u2157,m140,BABE,Nothing.
72791,L395729,u2175,m140,MABEL,"What's the matter, hon?"
72792,L395944,u2157,m140,BABE,Hello . . .
72793,L395943,u2176,m140,MAC,"It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing."
72794,L395941,u2176,m140,MAC,"Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?"
72795,L395940,u2157,m140,BABE,"This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices."
72796,L395898,u2157,m140,BABE,Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
72797,L395897,u2176,m140,MAC,"Oh, as bad as that, huh?"
72798,L395896,u2157,m140,BABE,That's the rub.
72799,L395895,u2176,m140,MAC,"I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?"
72800,L395894,u2157,m140,BABE,He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
72801,L395893,u2176,m140,MAC,You're crazy! You can't do that!
72802,L395892,u2157,m140,BABE,I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
72803,L395891,u2176,m140,MAC,Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
72804,L395890,u2157,m140,BABE,I'm going to tell him the truth.
72805,L395889,u2176,m140,MAC,What're you going to do?
72806,L395886,u2176,m140,MAC,"Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?"
72807,L395885,u2157,m140,BABE,"Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?"
72808,L395884,u2176,m140,MAC,"Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he"
72809,L395883,u2157,m140,BABE,"Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!"
72810,L395882,u2176,m140,MAC,"Why, Babe - that's terrific!  ""Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"""
72811,L395881,u2157,m140,BABE,Yes.
72812,L395880,u2176,m140,MAC,Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
72813,L395879,u2157,m140,BABE,Last night he proposed to me.
72814,L395878,u2176,m140,MAC,"What's bothering you, huh?"
72815,L395540,u2176,m140,MAC,"You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it."
72816,L395539,u2157,m140,BABE,With pay!  She is out the door.
72817,L395538,u2176,m140,MAC,Sure.
72818,L395537,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay."
72819,L395536,u2176,m140,MAC,"Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!"
