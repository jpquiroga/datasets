72819,L395536,u2176,m140,MAC,"Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!"
72820,L395535,u2157,m140,BABE,I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
72821,L395534,u2176,m140,MAC,"You're a genius, Babe - a genius!"
72822,L395533,u2157,m140,BABE,"Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson."
72823,L395532,u2176,m140,MAC,When're you going to see him again?
72824,L395531,u2157,m140,BABE,I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
72825,L395530,u2176,m140,MAC,"Marvelous!  ""At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'""  Beautiful! What happened after that?"
72826,L395529,u2157,m140,BABE,Had the boys follow us.
72827,L395528,u2176,m140,MAC,How'd you get the picture?
72828,L395527,u2157,m140,BABE,"If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune."
72829,L395526,u2176,m140,MAC,"Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?"
72830,L395525,u2157,m140,BABE,He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
72831,L395524,u2176,m140,MAC,Is he really that big a sap?
72832,L395523,u2157,m140,BABE,I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
72833,L395522,u2176,m140,MAC,Did it?
72834,L395521,u2157,m140,BABE,"It took some high-powered acting, believe me."
72835,L395520,u2176,m140,MAC,"Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!"
72836,L395206,u2157,m140,BABE,Have lunch.
72837,L395205,u2176,m140,MAC,"Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?"
72838,L395204,u2157,m140,BABE,Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
72839,L395203,u2176,m140,MAC,Uh-huh.
72840,L395202,u2157,m140,BABE,With pay!
72841,L395201,u2176,m140,MAC,With pay!
72842,L395200,u2157,m140,BABE,Can I have a month's vacation?
72843,L395199,u2176,m140,MAC,"Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have"
72844,L395198,u2157,m140,BABE,"Oh, he's not getting away with anything."
72845,L395197,u2176,m140,MAC,"What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this."
72846,L395196,u2157,m140,BABE,"Look, I can do it!"
72847,L395847,u2158,m140,BOB,Come on - let's go!
72848,L395846,u2168,m140,FRANK,Ow! My foot's asleep!
72849,L395808,u2168,m140,FRANK,Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
72850,L395807,u2158,m140,BOB,"Boy, was he burning."
72851,L395806,u2168,m140,FRANK,Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
72852,L395723,u2168,m140,FRANK,Shhh!
72853,L395722,u2158,m140,BOB,I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
72854,L395610,u2168,m140,FRANK,Babe ought to get him drunk again.
72855,L395609,u2158,m140,BOB,It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
72856,L395424,u2158,m140,BOB,Hurry up!
72857,L395423,u2168,m140,FRANK,"Come on, come on!"
72858,L395411,u2158,m140,BOB,Right.
72859,L395410,u2168,m140,FRANK,I tell you that dame's nuts.
72860,L395409,u2158,m140,BOB,I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
72861,L395656,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!"
72862,L395655,u2159,m140,BUDINGTON,"Yes, but you said"
72863,L395654,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!"
72864,L395653,u2159,m140,BUDINGTON,"don't want to be critical, John, but here it is"
72865,L395179,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office."
72866,L395178,u2159,m140,BUDINGTON,"But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get"
72867,L395177,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?"
72868,L395176,u2159,m140,BUDINGTON,"But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh"
72869,L395175,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already."
72870,L395165,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?"
72871,L395164,u2159,m140,BUDINGTON,John
72872,L395163,u2162,m140,CEDAR,We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
72873,L395926,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
72874,L395925,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"I wish you luck, sir."
72875,L395924,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Perfect! Perfect!
72876,L395923,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"How is this, sir?"
72877,L395920,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Yes.
72878,L395919,u2160,m140,BUTLER,Me sir?
72879,L395918,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Sit over there, will you?"
72880,L395916,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Yes, sir."
72881,L395915,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it."
72882,L395914,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir."
72883,L395913,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
72884,L395912,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Stuff, sir?"
72885,L395909,u2160,m140,BUTLER,A smaller bowl of flowers.
72886,L395908,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?"
72887,L395907,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Oh, yes sir."
72888,L395906,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Is that the best you've got?
72889,L395905,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Yes, sir."
72890,L395904,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Fourteen carat?
72891,L395903,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Yes, sir."
72892,L395902,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Gold, eh?"
72893,L395901,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir."
72894,L395900,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,How's it going? Okay?
72895,L395779,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Me, sir?"
72896,L395778,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,You try it.
72897,L395602,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on."
72898,L395601,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Yes, sir."
72899,L395600,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Who? Miss Dawson?
72900,L395599,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Miss Dawson on the phone, sir."
72901,L395598,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
72902,L395360,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"Yes, sir."
72903,L395359,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
72904,L395219,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
72905,L395218,u2160,m140,BUTLER,"The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir."
72906,L395965,u2166,m140,FARMER,Let me go!
72907,L395964,u2161,m140,BUTLERS,We'll send for the police!
72908,L395963,u2166,m140,FARMER,I wanna see that guy!
72909,L395962,u2161,m140,BUTLERS,"He's not home, I tell you!"
72910,L395961,u2166,m140,FARMER,Let me go! I wanna see him!
72911,L395960,u2161,m140,BUTLERS,You can't come up here!
72912,L395669,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?"
72913,L395668,u2167,m140,FIRST BROTHER,"They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money."
72914,L395667,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Nuisance value?
72915,L395666,u2167,m140,FIRST BROTHER,They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
72916,L395665,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Relatives of old man Semple.
72917,L395167,u2162,m140,CEDAR,The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
72918,L395166,u2167,m140,FIRST BROTHER,"Come on, John. What happened?"
72919,L395016,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb."
72920,L395015,u2167,m140,FIRST BROTHER,"Better wire him right away, John."
72921,L395014,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Thank heaven.
72922,L396343,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Mr. Cedar!
72923,L396342,u2162,m140,CEDAR,But your honor
72924,L396341,u2172,m140,JUDGE,You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
72925,L396338,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
72926,L396337,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Mr. Cedar!
72927,L396336,u2162,m140,CEDAR,It's a lie!
72928,L396301,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Proceed.
72929,L396300,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Your Honor, I object."
72930,L396181,u2162,m140,CEDAR,What was that you said he was?
72931,L396180,u2172,m140,JUDGE,He's what?
72932,L396177,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?"
72933,L396176,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Must we have the echo?
72934,L396163,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
72935,L396162,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify."
72936,L396123,u2162,m140,CEDAR,This is outrageous!
72937,L396122,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Miss Bennett please!
72938,L395221,u2163,m140,COBB,"I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down."
72939,L395220,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on."
72940,L395144,u2163,m140,COBB,That tuba player!
72941,L395143,u2162,m140,CEDAR,What?
72942,L395142,u2163,m140,COBB,Look!
72943,L395138,u2163,m140,COBB,I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
72944,L395137,u2162,m140,CEDAR,You can't?
72945,L395136,u2163,m140,COBB,I can't find him.
72946,L395132,u2163,m140,COBB,"See you later, kid."
72947,L395131,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you."
72948,L395105,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it."
72949,L395104,u2163,m140,COBB,Yeah. A glorified doormat.
72950,L395042,u2163,m140,COBB,"No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions."
72951,L395041,u2162,m140,CEDAR,I guess we'd better try somebody else.
72952,L395023,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
72953,L395022,u2163,m140,COBB,That's pretty.
72954,L395009,u2163,m140,COBB,It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
72955,L395008,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him."
72956,L395007,u2163,m140,COBB,But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
72957,L395006,u2162,m140,CEDAR,I'm not interested in the newspapers.
72958,L395005,u2163,m140,COBB,"Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers."
72959,L395004,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Hang up.
72960,L395003,u2163,m140,COBB,"Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney"
72961,L395002,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Hang up.
72962,L395001,u2163,m140,COBB,Wants to know who the heir is.
72963,L395000,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Newspaperman?
72964,L396026,u2180,m140,VOICE,Okay.
72965,L396025,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
72966,L396024,u2180,m140,VOICE,Yeah?
72967,L396023,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie"
72968,L396022,u2180,m140,VOICE,All set.
72969,L396021,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?"
72970,L395020,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
72971,L395019,u2180,m140,VOICE,Where?
72972,L395018,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont."
72973,L395017,u2180,m140,VOICE,Yes?
72974,L395366,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir."
72975,L395365,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them."
72976,L395364,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair."
72977,L395243,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
72978,L395242,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds."
72979,L395241,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in."
72980,L395240,u2162,m140,CEDAR,A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
72981,L395239,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Why not? Who is he?
72982,L395230,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, yes. Yes, I will."
72983,L395229,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I mean, about the Power of Attorney."
72984,L395228,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Huh?
72985,L395227,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds."
72986,L395217,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet."
72987,L395216,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates."
72988,L395215,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?"
72989,L395214,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
72990,L395213,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?"
72991,L395212,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Yes. That is to say
72992,L395211,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?"
72993,L395210,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds."
72994,L395209,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet."
72995,L395208,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something."
72996,L395154,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
72997,L395153,u2162,m140,CEDAR,No?
72998,L395152,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, I wasn't worried about that."
72999,L395151,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me."
73000,L395150,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"No, thank you."
73001,L395149,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Will you have a cigar?
73002,L395126,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,When?
73003,L395125,u2162,m140,CEDAR,You're going to New York with us.
73004,L395124,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What for?
73005,L395123,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack."
73006,L395118,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Who - me? No.
73007,L395117,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?"
73008,L395103,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Buffer?
73009,L395102,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
73010,L395099,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?"
73011,L395098,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!"
73012,L395094,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to"
73013,L395093,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy."
73014,L395092,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know."
73015,L395091,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?"
73016,L395090,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Why, no."
73017,L395089,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Are your parents living?
73018,L395088,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Yes.
73019,L395087,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?"
73020,L395086,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,All right.
73021,L395085,u2162,m140,CEDAR,I'd like to ask you a few questions.
73022,L395078,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington."
73023,L395077,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,How do you do.
73024,L395076,u2162,m140,CEDAR,How do you do.
73025,L395075,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Yes.
73026,L395074,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
73027,L395062,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
73028,L395061,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?"
73029,L395060,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,"No, I'm his housekeeper."
73030,L395059,u2162,m140,CEDAR,That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
73031,L395058,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
73032,L395057,u2162,m140,CEDAR,"No, thanks."
73033,L395056,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,"Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?"
73034,L395054,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,"No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park."
73035,L395053,u2162,m140,CEDAR,Is Mr. Deeds in?
73036,L395052,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,"Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?"
73037,L396046,u2163,m140,COBB,"Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches."
73038,L396045,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry."
73039,L396044,u2163,m140,COBB,What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
73040,L396043,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
73041,L396039,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?"
73042,L396038,u2163,m140,COBB,"Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks."
73043,L396037,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?"
73044,L396036,u2163,m140,COBB,What about your knocking off for lunch?
73045,L395959,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,They can have the Estate.
73046,L395958,u2163,m140,COBB,You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
73047,L395939,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Shut up!
73048,L395938,u2163,m140,COBB,"She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - ""Cinderella Man."" You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!"
73049,L395935,u2163,m140,COBB,"Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing"
73050,L395934,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
73051,L395933,u2163,m140,COBB,"Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too."
73052,L395597,u2163,m140,COBB,"Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor."
73053,L395596,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Yes, I guess I'll have to."
73054,L395595,u2163,m140,COBB,That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
73055,L395594,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"But what about this ""Cinderella Man""?"
73056,L395593,u2163,m140,COBB,"Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you."
73057,L395592,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to"
73058,L395591,u2163,m140,COBB,Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
73059,L395590,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Sometimes it's the only solution.
73060,L395589,u2163,m140,COBB,"No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything."
73061,L395588,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
73062,L395587,u2163,m140,COBB,They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
73063,L395586,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"I don't remember. ""Cinderella Man!"" What do they mean by that?"
73064,L395585,u2163,m140,COBB,Are those stories true?
73065,L395584,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"What do they mean by this - ""Cinderella Man!"""
73066,L395583,u2163,m140,COBB,What do you think bodyguards are for?
73067,L395582,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, they insisted on following me."
73068,L395581,u2163,m140,COBB,And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
73069,L395580,u2163,m140,COBB,What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
73070,L395579,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
73071,L395578,u2163,m140,COBB,Arthur! Who's Arthur?
73072,L395577,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Arthur wants to quit!
73073,L395576,u2163,m140,COBB,Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
73074,L395376,u2163,m140,COBB,"Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!"
73075,L395375,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Some other time, Cobb. Some other time."
73076,L395374,u2163,m140,COBB,Name your poison and I'll supply it.
73077,L395373,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Oh.
73078,L395372,u2163,m140,COBB,Women! Ever heard of 'em?
73079,L395371,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What're you talking about?
73080,L395370,u2163,m140,COBB,"Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?"
73081,L395369,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Entertainment?
73082,L395368,u2163,m140,COBB,"Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?"
73083,L395363,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Only common sense.
73084,L395362,u2163,m140,COBB,I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
73085,L395266,u2163,m140,COBB,Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
73086,L395265,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That's funny. Why is that?
73087,L395264,u2163,m140,COBB,Uh-huh.
73088,L395263,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?"
73089,L395260,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me."
73090,L395259,u2163,m140,COBB,"You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from ""Lucia.""[2]"
73091,L395226,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was."
73092,L395225,u2163,m140,COBB,"Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur."
73093,L395224,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
73094,L395223,u2163,m140,COBB,"Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  ""Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."""
73095,L395222,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?"
73096,L395148,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"No, thanks."
73097,L395147,u2163,m140,COBB,Have a drink?
73098,L395128,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I don't think we've got any suitcases.
73099,L395127,u2163,m140,COBB,This afternoon - at four o'clock.
73100,L395116,u2163,m140,COBB,"Oh, that's different if it's just poetry."
73101,L395115,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help."
73102,L395114,u2163,m140,COBB,I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
73103,L395113,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Huh?
73104,L395112,u2163,m140,COBB,Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
73105,L395111,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"""There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"""
73106,L395110,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I've got one for Cobb
73107,L395109,u2163,m140,COBB,Nah.
73108,L395108,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?"
73109,L395107,u2163,m140,COBB,Why should you?
73110,L395106,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington."
73111,L395101,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it."
73112,L395100,u2163,m140,COBB,"Oh, it'll do in a pinch."
73113,L395323,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman."
73114,L395322,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,"Because it just isn't a business, that's all!"
73115,L395321,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Why not?
73116,L395320,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,"You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business."
73117,L395319,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Now, where were we?"
73118,L395316,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that ."
73119,L395315,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,Naturally.
73120,L395314,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Me?!
73121,L395313,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,"Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you."
73122,L395312,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?"
73123,L395311,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
73124,L395310,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows."
73125,L395309,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
73126,L395306,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?"
73127,L395305,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,We provide opera.
73128,L395302,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"We own an opera house, don't we?"
73129,L395301,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,"Why, it's an artistic institution"
73130,L395300,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,It isn't? What is it conducted for?
73131,L395299,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,"You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit."
73132,L395296,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it."
73133,L395295,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,"Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings."
73134,L395294,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
73135,L395280,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I'm Chairman.
73136,L395279,u2164,m140,DOUGLAS,"Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected."
73137,L395278,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I'm Chairman?
73138,L396225,u2181,m140,VON HOLLER,"It takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?"
73139,L396224,u2165,m140,DR. FOSDICK,Ja.
73140,L396223,u2181,m140,VON HOLLER,It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
73141,L396222,u2165,m140,DR. FOSDICK,"Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting."
73142,L396221,u2181,m140,VON HOLLER,"Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?"
73143,L396220,u2165,m140,DR. FOSDICK,Uh-huh.
73144,L396219,u2181,m140,VON HOLLER,"You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples."
73145,L396008,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?"
73146,L396007,u2166,m140,FARMER,my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
73147,L396006,u2166,m140,FARMER,"Oh, Mr. Deeds"
73148,L396005,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
73149,L396004,u2166,m140,FARMER,Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
73150,L395978,u2166,m140,FARMER,Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
73151,L395977,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!"
73152,L395976,u2166,m140,FARMER,Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
73153,L395973,u2166,m140,FARMER,"Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!"
73154,L395972,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Let him alone.
73155,L395358,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters."
73156,L395357,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is."
73157,L395356,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"Now wait a minute, buddy"
73158,L395355,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that."
73159,L395354,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds."
73160,L395350,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million."
73161,L395349,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?"
73162,L395348,u2169,m140,HALLOR,Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
73163,L395345,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?"
73164,L395344,u2169,m140,HALLOR,Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
73165,L395338,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Oh. That.
73166,L395337,u2169,m140,HALLOR,I say we don't want to appear greedy.
73167,L395336,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Huh?
73168,L395335,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds."
73169,L395329,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
73170,L395328,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"No, I mean - about my client."
73171,L395327,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Why, I turned them down, naturally."
73172,L395326,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"What about it, Mr. Deeds?"
73173,L395325,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000."
73174,L395262,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back."
73175,L395261,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?"
73176,L395257,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it."
73177,L395256,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds."
73178,L395255,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
73179,L395254,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"Yes, sir."
73180,L395253,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,A child? My uncle's?
73181,L395252,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child."
73182,L395251,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What kind of wife did you say she was?
73183,L395250,u2169,m140,HALLOR,"I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?"
73184,L395247,u2169,m140,HALLOR,Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
73185,L395246,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Mrs. Semple?
73186,L395493,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Yeah, what if I am? What about it?"
73187,L395492,u2170,m140,HENABERRY,"Look, he's temperamental."
73188,L395480,u2170,m140,HENABERRY,You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
73189,L395479,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,No.
73190,L395474,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, I play the tuba."
73191,L395473,u2170,m140,HENABERRY,Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
73192,L395466,u2170,m140,HENABERRY,"Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off."
73193,L395465,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, I don't know. I"
73194,L395462,u2170,m140,HENABERRY,"Why, you must drink! All poets drink!"
73195,L395461,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"No - I don't want it, thank you."
73196,L396347,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Thank you, Your Honor."
73197,L396346,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Proceed.
73198,L396345,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
73199,L396344,u2172,m140,JUDGE,"Anything else, Mr. Deeds?"
73200,L396329,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers."
73201,L396328,u2172,m140,JUDGE,"Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed."
73202,L396325,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor."
73203,L396324,u2172,m140,JUDGE,"Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon."
73204,L396303,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Not at all.
73205,L396302,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
73206,L396295,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the ""Cinderella Man"" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined."
73207,L396294,u2172,m140,JUDGE,"Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?"
73208,L396285,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you."
73209,L396284,u2172,m140,JUDGE,A what?
73210,L396282,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I"
73211,L396281,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Proceed.
73212,L396280,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Take the stand!
73213,L396279,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
73214,L396278,u2172,m140,JUDGE,Yes?
73215,L396277,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Your Honor
73216,L395446,u2182,m140,WAITER,Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
73217,L395445,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Oh, the poet? Where?"
73218,L395444,u2182,m140,WAITER,Brookfield just came in.
73219,L395441,u2182,m140,WAITER,Uh-huh.
73220,L395440,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I write poetry.
73221,L395439,u2182,m140,WAITER,Uh-huh.
73222,L395438,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"I'm a writer myself, you know."
73223,L395437,u2182,m140,WAITER,Uh-huh.
73224,L395436,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?"
73225,L395435,u2182,m140,WAITER,"Huh? On, no. Nobody important."
73226,L395513,u2177,m140,MORROW,"Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!"
73227,L395512,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That ought to be fun.
73228,L395511,u2177,m140,MORROW,"Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet."
73229,L395510,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Binge?
73230,L395509,u2177,m140,MORROW,"Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?"
73231,L395508,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
73232,L395507,u2177,m140,MORROW,"Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before."
73233,L395506,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights."
73234,L395505,u2177,m140,MORROW,"Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!"
73235,L395504,u2177,m140,MORROW,The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
73236,L395503,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,That's all right. I got it off my chest.
73237,L395502,u2177,m140,MORROW,"Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard."
73238,L395135,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
73239,L395134,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
73240,L395130,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though."
73241,L395129,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,"Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year."
73242,L395122,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Now you keep out of this!
73243,L395121,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
73244,L395120,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Don't pay any attention to her.
73245,L395119,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,"No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married"
73246,L395097,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel."
73247,L395096,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
73248,L395084,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
73249,L395083,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
73250,L395073,u2178,m140,MRS. MEREDITH,I don't know.
73251,L395072,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Who are they?
73252,L396035,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Oh. Oh!
73253,L396034,u2179,m140,SVENSON,South Dakota - but on the top.
73254,L396033,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,South Dakota - north?
73255,L396032,u2179,m140,SVENSON,South Dakota north.
73256,L396031,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Where is your farm?
73257,L396030,u2179,m140,SVENSON,"Yes, ma'am."
73258,L396029,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Farmer?
73259,L396028,u2179,m140,SVENSON,Christian Svenson.
73260,L396027,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What is your name?
73261,L395845,u2175,m140,MABEL,Thank you so much. Good night.
73262,L395844,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
73263,L395840,u2175,m140,MABEL,"Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one."
73264,L395839,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?"
73265,L395838,u2175,m140,MABEL,"Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately."
73266,L395837,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?"
73267,L395831,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out."
73268,L395830,u2175,m140,MABEL,You mean  by the neck or something?

73302,L395566,u2183,m140,WALTER,"The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: ""Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"""

73334,L395343,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
73335,L395342,u2183,m140,WALTER,"Yes, sir."
73336,L395341,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
73337,L395340,u2183,m140,WALTER,"Why, I'm assisting you, sir."
73338,L395339,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,What do you think you're doing?
73339,L395332,u2183,m140,WALTER,"Yes, sir."
73340,L395331,u2173,m140,LONGFELLOW,"What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life."
73341,L395330,u2183,m140,WALTER,"Tails tonight, sir?"
73342,L400278,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"""There's no shame in getting a little therapy"", right, Doc?"
73343,L400277,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You can go out there if you like...
73344,L400274,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass."
73345,L400273,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Take your time.
73346,L400272,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --"
73347,L400267,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't ""worked for him"" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things."
73348,L400266,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Doubtful. What did he say?
73349,L400265,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?"
73350,L400264,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You must have been concerned.
73351,L400263,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon."
73352,L400262,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What happened?
73353,L400261,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
73354,L400260,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,One hundred books?
73355,L400259,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99."
73356,L400258,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Uh-huh. What are they?
73357,L400257,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"I had ordered some books. ""The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."""
73358,L400256,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
73359,L400255,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
73360,L399753,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
73361,L399752,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Really? You think so?
73362,L399751,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
73363,L399750,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Hmm?
73364,L399749,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
73365,L399748,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Good kids.
73366,L399747,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?"
73367,L399746,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,How did they threaten you?
73368,L399745,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,"It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me."
73369,L399744,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
73370,L399743,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,Why are they ganging up against me?
73371,L399742,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Me more than most.
73372,L399741,u2184,m141,ALTHEA,What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
73373,L400341,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,A friend?
73374,L400340,u2185,m141,COOK,Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
73375,L400332,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
73376,L400331,u2185,m141,COOK,Were you supposed to have a session?
73377,L400330,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?"
73378,L399772,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
73379,L399771,u2185,m141,COOK,I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
73380,L399770,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
73381,L399769,u2185,m141,COOK,"Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?"
73382,L399768,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Why's that?
73383,L399767,u2185,m141,COOK,"Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either..."
73384,L399766,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
73385,L399765,u2185,m141,COOK,That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
73386,L399764,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
73387,L399763,u2185,m141,COOK,"We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom..."
73388,L399762,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What's that?
73389,L399761,u2185,m141,COOK,It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
73390,L399760,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Uh-huh.
73391,L399759,u2185,m141,COOK,"I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today..."
73392,L399758,u2185,m141,COOK,Could you come with me please?
73393,L399757,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Mr. Cook.
73394,L399756,u2185,m141,COOK,Dr. Mumford.
73395,L400600,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Not any more.
73396,L400599,u2186,m141,CORRECTIONAL OFFICER,But you do therapy?
73397,L400598,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"No, not really."
73398,L400597,u2186,m141,CORRECTIONAL OFFICER,"You're the shrink, aren't you?"
73399,L400596,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'm fine.
73400,L400595,u2186,m141,CORRECTIONAL OFFICER,Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
73401,L400327,u2198,m141,SHEELER,"No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such..."
73402,L400326,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout..."
73403,L400325,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?"
73404,L400324,u2198,m141,SHEELER,"You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?"
73405,L400319,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
73406,L400318,u2198,m141,SHEELER,"But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd."
73407,L400236,u2198,m141,SHEELER,So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
73408,L400235,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,...And I from Phyllis.
73409,L400234,u2198,m141,SHEELER,"What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco..."
73410,L400225,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
73411,L400224,u2198,m141,SHEELER,Thank you.
73412,L399785,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,I think he's got a point.
73413,L399784,u2198,m141,SHEELER,"Ernest, what do you think?"
73414,L399783,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,What an asshole!
73415,L400458,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife."
73416,L400457,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
73417,L400456,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
73418,L400455,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What's that?
73419,L400454,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though."
73420,L400453,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I see.
73421,L400452,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board."
73422,L400451,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What kind of doubts?
73423,L400450,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring..."
73424,L400449,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,How do you mean?
73425,L400448,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow."
73426,L400251,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,My approach?
73427,L400250,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
73428,L400243,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
73429,L400242,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,Interesting approach. What was his name?
73430,L400238,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,"I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?"
73431,L400237,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
73432,L400233,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Are we?
73433,L400232,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
73434,L400230,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Right now?
73435,L400229,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,What are you doing for lunch?
73436,L400223,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Of course... I've heard great things about you.
73437,L400222,u2187,m141,DELBANCO,I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
73438,L400221,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
73439,L400467,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,"Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --"
73440,L400466,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I feel like we're making real progress here.
73441,L400392,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,My pleasure.
73442,L400391,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,"Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for..."
73443,L400386,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
73444,L400385,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,"Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here."
73445,L400382,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,And the experiment is in here?
73446,L400381,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment."
73447,L400380,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,But you did come to me.
73448,L400379,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
73449,L400378,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --"
73450,L400377,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
73451,L400376,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You remember when I asked you about pornography --
73452,L400375,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,What exactly is it supposed to do?
73453,L400374,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
73454,L400373,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,Should I open it now?
73455,L400372,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's a thought I had.
73456,L400371,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,What is it?
73457,L400003,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,You are so mean.
73458,L400002,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What's that?
73459,L400001,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Now we're back on track.
73460,L400000,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,I was... never satisfied.
73461,L399999,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What?!
73462,L399998,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
73463,L399997,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I didn't hear you.
73464,L399996,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,Go to hell.
73465,L399995,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Where's your wife, Henry?"
73466,L399993,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,I never said that.
73467,L399992,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
73468,L399991,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,No?
73469,L399990,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
73470,L399989,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
73471,L399988,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
73472,L399987,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,"You find it distasteful, don't you?"
73473,L399986,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Not for this. Not me, you're not."
73474,L399985,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,Why? I'm paying for this.
73475,L399984,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Stop now.
73476,L399983,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,What?
73477,L399982,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Henry!
73478,L399981,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
73479,L399980,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Mr. Follett.
73480,L399979,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
73481,L399645,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Good, then go."
73482,L399644,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,"Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --"
73483,L399643,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come."
73484,L399642,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,"Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --"
73485,L399641,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?"
73486,L399640,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,Why not?
73487,L399639,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I don't want to hear any more today.
73488,L399638,u2188,m141,FOLLETT,I have eighteen more minutes!
73489,L400445,u2189,m141,GILROY,"I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch."
73490,L400444,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What brought this on?
73491,L400443,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Mr. Gilroy --
73492,L400442,u2189,m141,GILROY,No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
73493,L400441,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Do you want to come in?
73494,L400440,u2189,m141,GILROY,"It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice."
73495,L400439,u2189,m141,GILROY,My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
73496,L400438,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
73497,L399884,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,She seems very unhappy.
73498,L399883,u2190,m141,JEREMY,"You're the doctor, what do you think?"
73499,L399882,u2190,m141,JEREMY,She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
73500,L399881,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What do you think's wrong with her?
73501,L399880,u2190,m141,JEREMY,No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
73502,L399879,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Tastes good.
73503,L399878,u2190,m141,JEREMY,"Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?"
73504,L399877,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,A little.
73505,L399876,u2190,m141,JEREMY,"We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?"
73506,L399875,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You've done well.
73507,L399874,u2190,m141,JEREMY,"Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now."
73508,L399873,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"We've been talking about her, mostly."
73509,L399872,u2190,m141,JEREMY,Althea hasn't told you?
73510,L399871,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What do you do?
73511,L399870,u2190,m141,JEREMY,"Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now."
73512,L399869,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, ""I should have spent more time at the office."""
73513,L399868,u2190,m141,JEREMY,"I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- ""I treated myself too well."""
73514,L399867,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I've had my moments.
73515,L399866,u2190,m141,JEREMY,Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
73516,L399863,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Nope.
73517,L399862,u2190,m141,JEREMY,I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
73518,L399860,u2190,m141,JEREMY,"Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five."
73519,L399859,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Doc. Nice to meet you.
73520,L399858,u2190,m141,JEREMY,You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
73521,L400586,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,"Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned."
73522,L400585,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry."
73523,L400584,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,"Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?"
73524,L400583,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'm sorry you're frustrated.
73525,L400582,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,What?
73526,L400581,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"I'm sorry, your honor."
73527,L400580,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,"Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000."
73528,L400579,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Yes.
73529,L400578,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
73530,L400577,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Yes, your honor."
73531,L400576,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
73532,L400575,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
73533,L400574,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I do.
73534,L400573,u2191,m141,JUDGE OTTO,"Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?"
73535,L400219,u2192,m141,LILY,"Well, come on in."
73536,L400218,u2199,m141,SKIP,Yeah.
73537,L400217,u2192,m141,LILY,You do?
73538,L400216,u2199,m141,SKIP,Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
73539,L400215,u2192,m141,LILY,"Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise."
73540,L400214,u2199,m141,SKIP,What are they?
73541,L400213,u2192,m141,LILY,It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
73542,L400212,u2199,m141,SKIP,That's a lot of people all at once.
73543,L400211,u2192,m141,LILY,I'd better get in there.
73544,L400210,u2199,m141,SKIP,"So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?"
73545,L400206,u2199,m141,SKIP,What?
73546,L400205,u2192,m141,LILY,"I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so..."
73547,L400204,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower."
73548,L400203,u2192,m141,LILY,Oh?
73549,L400202,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house..."
73550,L400517,u2192,m141,LILY,"Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love."
73551,L400516,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What it might take is... doing time.
73552,L400515,u2192,m141,LILY,Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
73553,L400514,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That's it? That's what you're giving me?
73554,L400513,u2192,m141,LILY,"Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing."
73555,L400512,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Okay.
73556,L400511,u2192,m141,LILY,"Yes, you do, you damn well do."
73557,L400510,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything."
73558,L400509,u2192,m141,LILY,I want to give you something. Will you let me?
73559,L400508,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You would have met in some shower eventually...
73560,L400507,u2192,m141,LILY,Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
73561,L400506,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,He told you.
73562,L400505,u2192,m141,LILY,I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
73563,L400504,u2192,m141,LILY,Doc.
73564,L400503,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Lily.
73565,L400502,u2192,m141,LILY,Doc...
73566,L400208,u2192,m141,LILY,...so accomplished.
73567,L400207,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,...so rich?
73568,L400201,u2192,m141,LILY,It's a pleasure to meet you.
73569,L400200,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily."
73570,L400197,u2192,m141,LILY,"You're on your own today, honey."
73571,L400196,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Where am I supposed to eat?
73572,L400195,u2192,m141,LILY,"They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour."
73573,L399914,u2192,m141,LILY,"No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening."
73574,L399913,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Why do you watch?
73575,L399912,u2192,m141,LILY,"Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park."
73576,L399911,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,...And?
73577,L399910,u2192,m141,LILY,"It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20."
73578,L399909,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
73579,L399908,u2192,m141,LILY,And the Brocketts?
73580,L399907,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's a pretty piece of land.
73581,L399906,u2192,m141,LILY,"Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?"
73582,L399755,u2192,m141,LILY,Doc.  Ainge...
73583,L399754,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily."
73584,L399666,u2192,m141,LILY,Not sure. Let me think about it.
73585,L399665,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You like me. How come?
73586,L399664,u2192,m141,LILY,"So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?"
73587,L399663,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man."
73588,L399662,u2192,m141,LILY,"You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down."
73589,L399660,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Lily, I don't think even you could know that --"
73590,L399659,u2192,m141,LILY,"Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined."
73591,L399658,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Oh, I don't know..."
73592,L399657,u2192,m141,LILY,How long you been in this town?
73593,L399654,u2192,m141,LILY,You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
73594,L399653,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What do you want to know?
73595,L399652,u2192,m141,LILY,"Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is."
73596,L399651,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It was Henry Follett.
73597,L399650,u2192,m141,LILY,I think it's like... inquisitive.
73598,L399649,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Does the phrase ""nosy"" have any meaning to you, Lily?"
73599,L399648,u2192,m141,LILY,Who was that?
73600,L399647,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,My patient had to leave early.
73601,L399646,u2192,m141,LILY,You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
73602,L400588,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Thanks for your help, Lionel."
73603,L400587,u2193,m141,LIONEL,It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
73604,L399775,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"You're right, as usual. See you."
73605,L399774,u2193,m141,LIONEL,"You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble."
73606,L399773,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Hello, Lionel."
73607,L399739,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope."
73608,L399738,u2193,m141,LIONEL,Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
73609,L399736,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?"
73610,L399735,u2193,m141,LIONEL,Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
73611,L399734,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here."
73612,L399733,u2193,m141,LIONEL,I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
73613,L399732,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Sure I can, Lionel."
73614,L399731,u2193,m141,LIONEL,-- you crazy? You can't do this!
73615,L399728,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,-- Go on!
73616,L399727,u2193,m141,LIONEL,...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
73617,L399724,u2193,m141,LIONEL,"Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way..."
73618,L399723,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
73619,L400436,u2194,m141,MARTIN,"Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa."
73620,L400435,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,How are you?
73621,L400434,u2194,m141,MARTIN,Did you straighten her out?
73622,L400433,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Martin.
73623,L400432,u2194,m141,MARTIN,"Hiya, Doc."
73624,L399900,u2194,m141,MARTIN,"No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot."
73625,L399899,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Is she a friend of yours?
73626,L399898,u2194,m141,MARTIN,What's wrong with her?
73627,L399896,u2194,m141,MARTIN,Got to.
73628,L399895,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'm trying.
73629,L399894,u2194,m141,MARTIN,Can you help Mom?
73630,L399893,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That would explain it.
73631,L399892,u2194,m141,MARTIN,I been drivin' since I was twelve.
73632,L399891,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You're good.
73633,L399890,u2194,m141,MARTIN,I just got my license two weeks ago.
73634,L399889,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Don't need it.
73635,L399888,u2194,m141,MARTIN,Got a license?  But no car?
73636,L399887,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Sure.
73637,L399886,u2194,m141,MARTIN,But you know how to drive?
73638,L400543,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Mother... go away!
73639,L400542,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,"It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister."
73640,L399926,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,What kind of doctor are you?
73641,L399925,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway."
73642,L399924,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,Do you think that's a good idea?
73643,L399923,u2200,m141,SOFIE,We're going for a walk.
73644,L399922,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,What's happening here?
73645,L399920,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,Mumford... like the town?
73646,L399919,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford."
73647,L400541,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that."
73648,L400540,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
73649,L400535,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,"No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling."
73650,L400534,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Could I see Sofie, please?"
73651,L400533,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,"Just who is here, can you tell me?"
73652,L400532,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Good evening, Mrs. Cook."
73653,L400531,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,"Well, look who's here..."
73654,L400366,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,"Take a hike, Dr. Quack!"
73655,L400365,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Wow. You're something.
73656,L400364,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
73657,L400363,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Well... you see, the problem is --"
73658,L400358,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
73659,L400357,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Why don't you tell me?
73660,L400356,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,I think you do.
73661,L400355,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"No, I really don't."
73662,L400354,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,I think you know what I mean.
73663,L400353,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What do you mean?
73664,L400352,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,"Finally, some common sense..."
73665,L400345,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,What?
73666,L400344,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,There's something I think we need to talk about.
73667,L400343,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,What'd you want?
73668,L399929,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"That's right, the fake kind."
73669,L399928,u2195,m141,MRS. COOK,Oh... not a real doctor.
73670,L399927,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Ph.D., psychologist."
73671,L400594,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
73672,L400593,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Will you be here?
73673,L400592,u2200,m141,SOFIE,We're only talking about six weeks.
73674,L400591,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Will you wait for me?
73675,L400590,u2200,m141,SOFIE,You got off easy.
73676,L400570,u2200,m141,SOFIE,What is your name?
73677,L400569,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Anything... just ask.
73678,L400568,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"...but first, you have to tell me something..."
73679,L400566,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
73680,L400565,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Oh.
73681,L400564,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
73682,L400563,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
73683,L400562,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Will you think about it?
73684,L400561,u2200,m141,SOFIE,What?
73685,L400560,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off."
73686,L400559,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"I know it! Please believe me, I know that..."
73687,L400558,u2200,m141,SOFIE,But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
73688,L400557,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,But...
73689,L400556,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I am irate!
73690,L400554,u2200,m141,SOFIE,You deserve it.
73691,L400553,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
73692,L400552,u2200,m141,SOFIE,You feel violated?
73693,L400551,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You're not the only one...
73694,L400550,u2200,m141,SOFIE,...How violated I feel?
73695,L400548,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You probably got the idea.
73696,L400547,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Part of it. We were watching ""ER"" until someone called."
73697,L400546,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Sofie...
73698,L400545,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Which show was that?
73699,L400544,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I guess you saw the show...?
73700,L400539,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?"
73701,L400538,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Mother...
73702,L400497,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --"
73703,L400496,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Hello.
73704,L400495,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Hello?
73705,L400494,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you."
73706,L400493,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Transference.
73707,L400492,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Transference!
73708,L400491,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What was that?
73709,L400490,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well."
73710,L400489,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I think so.
73711,L400488,u2200,m141,SOFIE,The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
73712,L400487,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Okay...
73713,L400486,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
73714,L400485,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I don't follow you.
73715,L400484,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way."
73716,L400483,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'm glad.
73717,L400482,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you."
73718,L400481,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Um-huh.
73719,L400480,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?"
73720,L400478,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
73721,L400477,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?"
73722,L400476,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Is it something you've heard about me?
73723,L400475,u2200,m141,SOFIE,How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
73724,L400474,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You're upset.
73725,L400473,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford."
73726,L400472,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Is something wrong, Sofie?"
73727,L400471,u2200,m141,SOFIE,It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
73728,L400469,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Of course.
73729,L400468,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
73730,L400416,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence."
73731,L400415,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Of course.
73732,L400414,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you."
73733,L400413,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I don't know if --
73734,L400412,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is."
73735,L400411,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That's... good?
73736,L400410,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
73737,L400409,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Yeah?
73738,L400408,u2200,m141,SOFIE,-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
73739,L400403,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I thought only action movies had villains like that.
73740,L400402,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me."
73741,L400401,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That's one way to put it.
73742,L400400,u2200,m141,SOFIE,My brother said you were about to fire me.
73743,L400399,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
73744,L400398,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Why'd you come to the house the other night?
73745,L400397,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Either one.
73746,L400396,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Which thing?
73747,L400395,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That's what I like.
73748,L400394,u2200,m141,SOFIE,When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
73749,L400174,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone."
73750,L400173,u2200,m141,SOFIE,And this is legitimate therapy?
73751,L400172,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
73752,L400171,u2200,m141,SOFIE,It's all right.
73753,L400170,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You like it?
73754,L400169,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
73755,L400168,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
73756,L400167,u2200,m141,SOFIE,And he's where?
73757,L400166,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
73758,L400165,u2200,m141,SOFIE,So whose route is this?
73759,L400164,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so."
73760,L400163,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Is that when you split up?
73761,L400161,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
73762,L400160,u2200,m141,SOFIE,And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
73763,L400159,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Disgusting.
73764,L400158,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"That was really bad, wasn't it?"
73765,L400157,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter."
73766,L400156,u2200,m141,SOFIE,...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
73767,L400155,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Yes.
73768,L400154,u2200,m141,SOFIE,You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
73769,L400153,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?"
73770,L400152,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It doesn't matter. Go on.
73771,L400151,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
73772,L400150,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You're doing great.
73773,L399974,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip."
73774,L399973,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric."
73775,L399972,u2200,m141,SOFIE,You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
73776,L399971,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,There... I've given myself a real whopper.
73777,L399970,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'"
73778,L399969,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Is that like a party trick?
73779,L399968,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I can give myself a headache instantly.
73780,L399967,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
73781,L399966,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache."
73782,L399965,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
73783,L399964,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
73784,L399963,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Life.
73785,L399962,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Where?
73786,L399961,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here."
73787,L399960,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused."
73788,L399959,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
73789,L399957,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Uh-huh.
73790,L399956,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Sore throat?
73791,L399955,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?..."
73792,L399954,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Be specific.
73793,L399953,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
73794,L399950,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach."
73795,L399949,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Sorry... I'm done.
73796,L399948,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Is this the treatment?
73797,L399947,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Really? What would it take?
73798,L399946,u2200,m141,SOFIE,No.
73799,L399945,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I've offended you!
73800,L399944,u2200,m141,SOFIE,You've got a funny idea of funny.
73801,L399943,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
73802,L399942,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?"
73803,L399941,u2200,m141,SOFIE,What?
73804,L399940,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Please... forgive me.
73805,L399939,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you ""marry beneath yourself""..."
73806,L399938,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Something's bothering her.
73807,L399937,u2200,m141,SOFIE,We don't discuss it.
73808,L399936,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Is she against you getting help?
73809,L399935,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Is that the technical description of what I've got?
73810,L399934,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
73811,L399933,u2200,m141,SOFIE,She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
73812,L399932,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
73813,L399931,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Mom's such a cutie.
73814,L399918,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Oh boy... this should be interesting.
73815,L399917,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,We'll turn back anytime you want.
73816,L399916,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I'm not making any promises.
73817,L399847,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
73818,L399846,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Maybe you'll catch it.
73819,L399845,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
73820,L399844,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
73821,L399843,u2200,m141,SOFIE,You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
73822,L399842,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,We'll work it out.
73823,L399841,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
73824,L399840,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
73825,L399839,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
73826,L399838,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I don't know. I barely made it today.
73827,L399837,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
73828,L399836,u2200,m141,SOFIE,What would you do?
73829,L399835,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
73830,L399834,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Even if you don't think it's real?
73831,L399833,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out."
73832,L399832,u2200,m141,SOFIE,Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
73833,L399831,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Hmm.
73834,L399830,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite."
73835,L399829,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?"
73836,L399828,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- ""Everything that's wrong with you is in your head."" I suppose that's true."
73837,L399827,u2200,m141,SOFIE,I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
73838,L399826,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,No.
73839,L399825,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?"
73840,L399824,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What?
73841,L399823,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit."
73842,L399822,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,When did you start to feel this way?
73843,L399821,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve."
73844,L399820,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What can you tell me about this?
73845,L399819,u2200,m141,SOFIE,"I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you."
73846,L399818,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
73847,L400430,u2197,m141,NESSA,"He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage."
73848,L400429,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,He agreed?
73849,L400428,u2197,m141,NESSA,"I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune."
73850,L400427,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Really?
73851,L400426,u2197,m141,NESSA,I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
73852,L400425,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,No again?
73853,L400424,u2197,m141,NESSA,...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
73854,L400422,u2197,m141,NESSA,"First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --"
73855,L400421,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What did he want you to do?
73856,L400420,u2197,m141,NESSA,"He said -- ""Which we already knew!"""
73857,L400419,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What'd he say?
73858,L400418,u2197,m141,NESSA,"...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, ""If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."""
73859,L400193,u2197,m141,NESSA,"No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo."
73860,L400192,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Do you think that's what he wants?
73861,L400191,u2197,m141,NESSA,There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
73862,L400189,u2197,m141,NESSA,This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
73863,L400188,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Uh-huh.
73864,L400187,u2197,m141,NESSA,I don't think you know what you're talking about.
73865,L400186,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,True. Should we stop them?
73866,L400185,u2197,m141,NESSA,"These appointments were not my idea, remember."
73867,L400184,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Was it something that happened at school?
73868,L400183,u2197,m141,NESSA,What are you talking about?
73869,L400182,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What happened today?
73870,L400181,u2197,m141,NESSA,I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
73871,L400180,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay."
73872,L400179,u2197,m141,NESSA,What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
73873,L400178,u2197,m141,NESSA,"Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous."
73874,L400177,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What do you want me to see?
73875,L400176,u2197,m141,NESSA,Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
73876,L399690,u2197,m141,NESSA,It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
73877,L399689,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That's not quite what I said --
73878,L399688,u2197,m141,NESSA,"I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew..."
73879,L399687,u2197,m141,NESSA,Have women found you attractive?
73880,L399686,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?"
73881,L399685,u2197,m141,NESSA,"Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- ""he handles produce well."" Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs."
73882,L399684,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Where was this?
73883,L399683,u2197,m141,NESSA,"Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was ""25 Signs He's Great in Bed"". It was very fascinating."
73884,L399682,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's my bit for the community.
73885,L399681,u2197,m141,NESSA,"Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?"
73886,L399680,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's called pro bono.
73887,L399679,u2197,m141,NESSA,The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
73888,L399677,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's a big part of the show.
73889,L399676,u2197,m141,NESSA,Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
73890,L399675,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?"
73891,L399674,u2197,m141,NESSA,"Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?"
73892,L399673,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Weekly or monthly?
73893,L399672,u2197,m141,NESSA,In maybe three or four issues.
73894,L399671,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"What do you mean, ""in no time""?"
73895,L399670,u2197,m141,NESSA,"...so he already had the tattoo that said, ""Naomi Forever""... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America."
73896,L400315,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Yep.
73897,L400314,u2199,m141,SKIP,Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
73898,L400311,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What?
73899,L400310,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Doc!... It's not me, is it?"
73900,L400308,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Yes, yes it does..."
73901,L400307,u2199,m141,SKIP,I guess that makes sense.
73902,L400306,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?"
73903,L400305,u2199,m141,SKIP,"I'm here for you, Doc."
73904,L400304,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Wow.
73905,L400303,u2199,m141,SKIP,Sorry...
73906,L400301,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked."
73907,L400300,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily."
73908,L400299,u2199,m141,SKIP,Lily.
73909,L400298,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What'd I do?
73910,L400297,u2199,m141,SKIP,"It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest."
73911,L400296,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Really?
73912,L400295,u2199,m141,SKIP,It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
73913,L400294,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
73914,L400293,u2199,m141,SKIP,This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
73915,L400292,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden."
73916,L400291,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?"
73917,L400289,u2199,m141,SKIP,You want my advice? Far out!
73918,L400288,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice."
73919,L400286,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You're completely reliable.
73920,L400285,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?"
73921,L400284,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'm honored.
73922,L400283,u2199,m141,SKIP,I've never brought anyone down here before.
73923,L400147,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,See you Thursday... regular time.
73924,L400146,u2199,m141,SKIP,Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
73925,L400145,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen."
73926,L400144,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Jeez, man. But you're good at it!"
73927,L400143,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,English Lit.
73928,L400142,u2199,m141,SKIP,Psych major?
73929,L400141,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,No... no training.
73930,L400140,u2199,m141,SKIP,"But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?"
73931,L400137,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased."
73932,L400136,u2199,m141,SKIP,And a birth certificate is enough?
73933,L400134,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See..."
73934,L400133,u2199,m141,SKIP,"""Mumford""... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?"
73935,L400132,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,What about it?
73936,L400129,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,All new people start with that...
73937,L400128,u2199,m141,SKIP,I know it starts with a birth certificate...
73938,L400127,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
73939,L400126,u2199,m141,SKIP,How'd you do it?  The new you.
73940,L400125,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
73941,L400124,u2199,m141,SKIP,"I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day."
73942,L400123,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That'd be Lily.
73943,L400122,u2199,m141,SKIP,Somebody's taking a shower down there.
73944,L400119,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert..."
73945,L400118,u2199,m141,SKIP,And the drugs?
73946,L400103,u2199,m141,SKIP,You and Candy...?
73947,L400102,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Things got a lot worse.
73948,L400101,u2199,m141,SKIP,At least you pulled yourself out...
73949,L400100,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --"
73950,L400099,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,But look at me now...
73951,L400098,u2199,m141,SKIP,"You were messed up, man."
73952,L400097,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"""Get to know your therapist."""
73953,L400096,u2199,m141,SKIP,Holy shit!
73954,L400095,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife."
73955,L400091,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS."
73956,L400090,u2199,m141,SKIP,Did you carry a gun?
73957,L400089,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It wasn't the best situation.
73958,L400088,u2199,m141,SKIP,An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
73959,L400087,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs."
73960,L400086,u2199,m141,SKIP,Sounds like you have several.
73961,L400085,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Everybody has a story, Skip."
73962,L400084,u2199,m141,SKIP,-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
73963,L400083,u2199,m141,SKIP,Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
73964,L400082,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
73965,L400057,u2199,m141,SKIP,What about everything? How did this happen?
73966,L400056,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I can tell you anything else.
73967,L400055,u2199,m141,SKIP,I've told you a lot of private stuff.
73968,L400054,u2199,m141,SKIP,It matters to me.
73969,L400053,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
73970,L400052,u2199,m141,SKIP,Damn! What is your name?
73971,L400051,u2199,m141,SKIP,"It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?"
73972,L400050,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Just you.
73973,L400049,u2199,m141,SKIP,Who else knows?
73974,L400045,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two."
73975,L400044,u2199,m141,SKIP,It's not?
73976,L400043,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Skip, that's not much of a secret."
73977,L400042,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Definitely.
73978,L400041,u2199,m141,SKIP,Really?
73979,L400040,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Sounds like kind of a good idea.
73980,L400039,u2199,m141,SKIP,"No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?"
73981,L400038,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
73982,L400037,u2199,m141,SKIP,You don't think I'm insane?
73983,L400036,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,How's it coming?
73984,L400035,u2199,m141,SKIP,"No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies."
73985,L400034,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,A doll?
73986,L400033,u2199,m141,SKIP,Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
73987,L400032,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Slash what?
73988,L400031,u2199,m141,SKIP,"No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion."
73989,L400030,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Jerking off?
73990,L400029,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Guess.  Go ahead, guess!"
73991,L400028,u2199,m141,SKIP,"It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?"
73992,L400027,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Okay... let's say that, for now."
73993,L400026,u2199,m141,SKIP,That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
73994,L400025,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"You are Panda, monarch of modems."
73995,L400024,u2199,m141,SKIP,"All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines."
73996,L400022,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --"
73997,L400021,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
73998,L400020,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --"
73999,L400018,u2199,m141,SKIP,"I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?"
74000,L400017,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
74001,L400016,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something..."
74002,L400014,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's just a thought.
74003,L400013,u2199,m141,SKIP,"You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?"
74004,L400012,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
74005,L400011,u2199,m141,SKIP,"I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got."
74006,L400008,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Yep.
74007,L400007,u2199,m141,SKIP,"How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit."
74008,L400006,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,That's all right. What's on your mind?
74009,L400005,u2199,m141,SKIP,Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
74010,L400004,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Hey, Skip."
74011,L399815,u2199,m141,SKIP,I wondered what happened to her...
74012,L399814,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her."
74013,L399813,u2199,m141,SKIP,Uh-huh.
74014,L399812,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character."
74015,L399811,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
74016,L399810,u2199,m141,SKIP,So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.

74023,L399802,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Well, there's Lily."
74024,L399801,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix."
74025,L399800,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
74026,L399799,u2199,m141,SKIP,Good-looking woman.
74027,L399798,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,She's probably ten years older than you.
74028,L399797,u2199,m141,SKIP,No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
74029,L399796,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?"
74030,L399795,u2199,m141,SKIP,Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
74031,L399794,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like."
74032,L399793,u2199,m141,SKIP,Don't you like this?
74033,L399792,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?"
74034,L399791,u2199,m141,SKIP,"Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me."
74035,L399790,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?"
74036,L399789,u2199,m141,SKIP,You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
74037,L399788,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with."
74038,L399787,u2199,m141,SKIP,This is exactly what I wanted.
74039,L399786,u2199,m141,SKIP,This is great!
74040,L399720,u2199,m141,SKIP,"No, no... I have three billion dollars."
74041,L399719,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
74042,L399718,u2199,m141,SKIP,I've got three big ones.
74043,L399717,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got."
74044,L399716,u2199,m141,SKIP,I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
74045,L399715,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I understand.
74046,L399714,u2199,m141,SKIP,"I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor."
74047,L399713,u2199,m141,SKIP,You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
74048,L399712,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Is that the question?
74049,L399711,u2199,m141,SKIP,"I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too."
74050,L399709,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Have you thought about getting a wife?
74051,L399708,u2199,m141,SKIP,Of course! That's exactly what I want.
74052,L399707,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Can I ask you a personal question?
74053,L399704,u2199,m141,SKIP,Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
74054,L399703,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Nah... scotch.
74055,L399702,u2199,m141,SKIP,Would you like another beer?
74056,L399699,u2199,m141,SKIP,Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
74057,L399698,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
74058,L399697,u2199,m141,SKIP,"...""Find the need and fill it"" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off."
74059,L399695,u2199,m141,SKIP,Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
74060,L399694,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,How are you?
74061,L399693,u2199,m141,SKIP,You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
74062,L400253,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little."
74063,L400252,u2198,m141,SHEELER,Yes... your particular approach.
74064,L400249,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
74065,L400248,u2198,m141,SHEELER,That was a terrible thing.
74066,L400247,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
74067,L400246,u2198,m141,SHEELER,Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
74068,L400245,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks."
74069,L400244,u2198,m141,SHEELER,"I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?"
74070,L400241,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place."
74071,L400240,u2198,m141,SHEELER,I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
74072,L400239,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,It's possible. I don't know about that.
74073,L400228,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
74074,L400227,u2198,m141,SHEELER,When?
74075,L400226,u2196,m141,MUMFORD,"Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that."
74076,L401318,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Well, okay then."
74077,L401317,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,"They are evil, cursed, they matter not."
74078,L401316,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,I never killed a priest before.
74079,L401315,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,Priests. Imhotep's priests.
74080,L401314,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Who the hell are these guys?
74081,L401267,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
74082,L401266,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,You know where he's taking her?
74083,L401083,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?"
74084,L401082,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
74085,L401081,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Relax, I got him."
74086,L401080,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,"I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years."
74087,L401278,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Did you say 'kill' my sister?
74088,L401277,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,"If he arrives before us, it will be too late."
74089,L401274,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Excuse me?
74090,L401273,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,And then killing your sister.
74091,L401272,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Oh yes, of course."
74092,L401271,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,By reading the Book Of The Dead.
74093,L401270,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,And how does one do that?
74094,L401269,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
74095,L401268,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,And what ritual would that be?
74096,L401091,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,You're not going to kill us?
74097,L401090,u2201,m142,ARDETH RAY,"We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all."
74098,L401195,u2202,m142,BENI,Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
74099,L401194,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,What does he want the book for?
74100,L401193,u2202,m142,BENI,The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
74101,L401192,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat."
74102,L401191,u2202,m142,BENI,You shall see.
74103,L401190,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Immune from what?
74104,L401189,u2202,m142,BENI,"It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune."
74105,L401188,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?"
74106,L401187,u2202,m142,BENI,What friend? You're my only friend.
74107,L401186,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Where's your new friend?
74108,L401125,u2202,m142,BENI,Do you know where I can steal some?
74109,L401124,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples."
74110,L401123,u2202,m142,BENI,He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
74111,L401122,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?"
74112,L401121,u2202,m142,BENI,"The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid."
74113,L401120,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Oh, hey, how ya doin'?"
74114,L401119,u2202,m142,BENI,"This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris."
74115,L401118,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?"
74116,L401117,u2202,m142,BENI,You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
74117,L401116,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?"
74118,L400968,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"'Cause I look good doin, it."
74119,L400967,u2202,m142,BENI,Why do you like to fight so much?
74120,L400966,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"C'mon, friend."
74121,L400965,u2202,m142,BENI,"Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!"
74122,L400964,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Goin' somewhere?
74123,L400915,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,I've had worse.
74124,L400914,u2202,m142,BENI,"Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good."
74125,L400856,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
74126,L400855,u2202,m142,BENI,Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
74127,L400836,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Sounds familiar.
74128,L400835,u2202,m142,BENI,O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
74129,L400834,u2202,m142,BENI,Even?
74130,L400833,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Let's make us even, shall we?"
74131,L400832,u2202,m142,BENI,You always did have more balls than brains.
74132,L400831,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble."
74133,L400829,u2202,m142,BENI,"Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way."
74134,L400828,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?"
74135,L400827,u2202,m142,BENI,"You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell."
74136,L400826,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you."
74137,L400825,u2202,m142,BENI,My very good friend! What a surprise.
74138,L400645,u2202,m142,BENI,Then what the hell are you doing here!?
74139,L400644,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"None of the above, thank you."
74140,L400643,u2202,m142,BENI,What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
74141,L400641,u2202,m142,BENI,"Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?"
74142,L400640,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Altar boys?
74143,L400639,u2202,m142,BENI,"I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?"
74144,L400638,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
74145,L400636,u2202,m142,BENI,In the desert? What for?
74146,L400635,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Now go find me a big stick.
74147,L400631,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
74148,L400630,u2202,m142,BENI,"Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?"
74149,L401311,u2202,m142,BENI,Yeah! Them.
74150,L401310,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Intestines.
74151,L401309,u2202,m142,BENI,"...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?"
74152,L401302,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Oh yes, always."
74153,L401301,u2202,m142,BENI,Yeah?
74154,L401290,u2202,m142,BENI,"All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing."
74155,L401289,u2205,m142,EVELYN,What just happened?
74156,L401050,u2205,m142,EVELYN,That's one way of putting it.
74157,L401049,u2202,m142,BENI,Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
74158,L401221,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Exactly --
74159,L401220,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld."
74160,L401219,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
74161,L401168,u2203,m142,CURATOR,It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
74162,L401167,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me."
74163,L401161,u2203,m142,CURATOR,To have stopped this creature? Yes!
74164,L401160,u2205,m142,EVELYN,And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
74165,L401153,u2203,m142,CURATOR,Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
74166,L401152,u2205,m142,EVELYN,What is he doing here?
74167,L401151,u2203,m142,CURATOR,Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
74168,L400684,u2203,m142,CURATOR,Perhaps.
74169,L400683,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it."
74170,L400665,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!"
74171,L400664,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library."
74172,L400663,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?"
74173,L400662,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"I'm sorry, it was an accident."
74174,L400779,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?"
74175,L400778,u2207,m142,HOOK,It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
74176,L400777,u2203,m142,CURATOR,And burn the map and retrieve the key.
74177,L400776,u2207,m142,HOOK,"Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her."
74178,L400775,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all."
74179,L400774,u2207,m142,HOOK,The key!? She has the lost key!?
74180,L400772,u2203,m142,CURATOR,No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
74181,L400771,u2207,m142,HOOK,She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
74182,L401237,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"If we want to kill the creature, yes."
74183,L401236,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
74184,L401235,u2203,m142,CURATOR,Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
74185,L401225,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"Correct, And that's when --"
74186,L401224,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
74187,L401223,u2203,m142,CURATOR,-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
74188,L401222,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --"
74189,L401163,u2203,m142,CURATOR,"According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing."
74190,L401162,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?"
74191,L401157,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Try me.
74192,L401156,u2203,m142,CURATOR,You will not believe it.
74193,L401155,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here."
74194,L401203,u2206,m142,HENDERSON,"Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser."
74195,L401202,u2204,m142,DANIELS,"The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?"
74196,L401180,u2204,m142,DANIELS,"Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'."
74197,L401179,u2206,m142,HENDERSON,The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
74198,L401089,u2206,m142,HENDERSON,What did you do to him!?
74199,L401088,u2204,m142,DANIELS,You bastards!
74200,L401054,u2204,m142,DANIELS,Water turning to blood.
74201,L401053,u2206,m142,HENDERSON,The sun turning black.
74202,L401032,u2204,m142,DANIELS,Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
74203,L401031,u2206,m142,HENDERSON,I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
74204,L400975,u2206,m142,HENDERSON,"For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there."
74205,L400974,u2204,m142,DANIELS,See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
74206,L400900,u2210,m142,WARDEN,Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
74207,L400899,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years."
74208,L400798,u2210,m142,WARDEN,"I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much."
74209,L400797,u2205,m142,EVELYN,What are you doing here?
74210,L400796,u2210,m142,WARDEN,A bright good morning to all.
74211,L400767,u2210,m142,WARDEN,Forty.
74212,L400766,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Twenty.
74213,L400765,u2210,m142,WARDEN,Fifty percent.
74214,L400764,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent."
74215,L400763,u2210,m142,WARDEN,Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
74216,L400762,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I would never!
74217,L400761,u2210,m142,WARDEN,You lie.
74218,L400753,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Three hundred pounds!
74219,L400752,u2210,m142,WARDEN,Proceed!
74220,L400751,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Two hundred pounds.
74221,L400750,u2210,m142,WARDEN,I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
74222,L400749,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
74223,L400748,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I am an English woman.
74224,L400747,u2210,m142,WARDEN,No women allowed.
74225,L400745,u2210,m142,WARDEN,To be hanged.
74226,L400744,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Where are they taking him?
74227,L400710,u2210,m142,WARDEN,He said... he was just looking for a good time.
74228,L400709,u2205,m142,EVELYN,And what did he say?
74229,L400708,u2210,m142,WARDEN,"I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself."
74230,L400707,u2205,m142,EVELYN,And what is he in prison for?
74231,L401255,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them."
74232,L401254,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Got guts, lady."
74233,L401249,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I have no choice.
74234,L401248,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Don't do it, Evelyn."
74235,L401229,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Got what?
74236,L401228,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Got it!
74237,L401210,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
74238,L401209,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I think you were jealous
74239,L401208,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech."
74240,L401207,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You called me your girl?
74241,L401143,u2205,m142,EVELYN,The creature!? Are you sure!?
74242,L401142,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
74243,L401115,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,FINE.
74244,L401114,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I'm staying.
74245,L401113,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot."
74246,L401112,u2205,m142,EVELYN,That's what I am to you? A contract?
74247,L401111,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated."
74248,L401110,u2205,m142,EVELYN,It's everybody's problem!
74249,L401109,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
74250,L401108,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed."
74251,L401107,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!"
74252,L401106,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
74253,L401104,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him."
74254,L401103,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
74255,L401102,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him."
74256,L401100,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"No, we are not."
74257,L401099,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone."
74258,L401098,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
74259,L401058,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book."
74260,L401057,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"You sure you outta be playin, around with that?"
74261,L401048,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
74262,L401047,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt."
74263,L401046,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,That bad huh?
74264,L401045,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed."
74265,L401042,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Very slowly.
74266,L401041,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?"
74267,L401020,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still..."
74268,L401019,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Is he supposed to look like that?
74269,L401012,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,You dream about dead guys?
74270,L401011,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl."
74271,L400998,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had."
74272,L400997,u2205,m142,EVELYN,No... Why?... Should I?
74273,L400992,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Because that's my name.
74274,L400991,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Why would I do that?
74275,L400990,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Not unless you call me Rick.
74276,L400989,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I'm not?
74277,L400988,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,No you're not.
74278,L400987,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell."
74279,L400985,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,And what is that?
74280,L400984,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am."
74281,L400983,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?"
74282,L400982,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself"
74283,L400981,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Something like that.
74284,L400980,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?"
74285,L400979,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew."
74286,L400957,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe."
74287,L400956,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"You don't believe in curses, huh?"
74288,L400955,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You two!
74289,L400953,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
74290,L400952,u2205,m142,EVELYN,How?
74291,L400951,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed."
74292,L400946,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Who was talking about what?
74293,L400945,u2205,m142,EVELYN,A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
74294,L400942,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
74295,L400941,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
74296,L400938,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty."
74297,L400937,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
74298,L400936,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus."
74299,L400933,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
74300,L400932,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Yeah, that'd bring you back to life."
74301,L400908,u2205,m142,EVELYN,For entering the afterlife.
74302,L400907,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Preparation for what?
74303,L400906,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Oh my god, It's a preparation room."
74304,L400898,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
74305,L400897,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,What are those mirrors for?
74306,L400896,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living."
74307,L400895,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,The things that get you excited.
74308,L400894,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"That ""thing"" gets me excited."
74309,L400880,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,We're about to be shown the way.
74310,L400879,u2205,m142,EVELYN,For what?
74311,L400870,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Are you sure?
74312,L400869,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,We're almost there.
74313,L400849,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Trust me.
74314,L400848,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it."
74315,L400847,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Can you swim?
74316,L400843,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Oh that's comforting.
74317,L400842,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
74318,L400821,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,I know my treasure.
74319,L400820,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You know your history.
74320,L400819,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?"
74321,L400818,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit."
74322,L400817,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Ahmar is Ossirion. ""Passageway to the underworld"", actually."
74323,L400816,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, ""the doorway to hell."""
74324,L400815,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?"
74325,L400814,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"There's something out there, you know, something under that sand."
74326,L400813,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
74327,L400812,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
74328,L400811,u2205,m142,EVELYN,If you call that a kiss.
74329,L400810,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?"
74330,L400809,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners."
74331,L400808,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya."
74332,L400769,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more."
74333,L400768,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
74334,L400741,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Really want to know?
74335,L400740,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Yes.
74336,L400739,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Want to know?
74337,L400738,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
74338,L400737,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,I found sand. I saw death.
74339,L400736,u2205,m142,EVELYN,What did you find? What did you see?
74340,L400735,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead."
74341,L400734,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"No, I mean --"
74342,L400733,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Every damn day.
74343,L400732,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You swear?
74344,L400731,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Yeah, I was there."
74345,L400730,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Yes, well...  I know my brother."
74346,L400729,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,I just decked your brother
74347,L400728,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You were actually at Hamunaptra?
74348,L400724,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Because that's where I found it. I was there.
74349,L400723,u2205,m142,EVELYN,How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
74350,L400722,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
74351,L400721,u2205,m142,EVELYN,No?
74352,L400720,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,No.
74353,L400719,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it."
74354,L400714,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Broad?!
74355,L400713,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,So who's the broad?
74356,L401353,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Yes,... I see."
74357,L401352,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
74358,L401350,u2205,m142,EVELYN,What's it look like!?
74359,L401349,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?"
74360,L401348,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Oh.
74361,L401347,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Finish the inscription, idiot!"
74362,L401339,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Read the inscription on the cover!
74363,L401338,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?"
74364,L401334,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Shut-up and get me off of here!
74365,L401333,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"I found it, Evy! I found it"
74366,L401022,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
74367,L401021,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Juicy?
74368,L400995,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Well neither do I, thank you."
74369,L400994,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there."
74370,L400993,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
74371,L400950,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Did you ever see him eat?
74372,L400949,u2205,m142,EVELYN,What do you suppose killed him?
74373,L400931,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Still...
74374,L400930,u2205,m142,EVELYN,It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
74375,L400919,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
74376,L400918,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my."
74377,L400884,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet."
74378,L400883,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?"
74379,L400785,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit."
74380,L400784,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word."
74381,L400783,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Do you really think he'll show up?
74382,L400712,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Way to go, Evy."
74383,L400711,u2205,m142,EVELYN,But he's just a filthy criminal?
74384,L400706,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Picked his pocket, actually."
74385,L400705,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
74386,L400704,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,That just makes you more gullible.
74387,L400703,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I'm your sister.
74388,L400702,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?"
74389,L400701,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You lied to me!
74390,L400700,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,I was mistaken.
74391,L400699,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
74392,L400693,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C."
74393,L400692,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes."
74394,L400691,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
74395,L400687,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much."
74396,L400686,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all."
74397,L400685,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
74398,L400682,u2205,m142,EVELYN,I think you found something.
74399,L400681,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Yes?
74400,L400680,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Jonathan?
74401,L400676,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you."
74402,L400675,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
74403,L400673,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note."
74404,L400672,u2205,m142,EVELYN,"Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours."
74405,L400671,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Right now, I only wish to join them."
74406,L400670,u2205,m142,EVELYN,Have you no respect for the dead?
74407,L400669,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
74408,L400668,u2205,m142,EVELYN,You...! YOU...!
74409,L401346,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,You have got to be joking?
74410,L401345,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!"
74411,L401298,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Got it.
74412,L401297,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
74413,L401296,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?"
74414,L401265,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it."
74415,L401264,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,We gotta get her back.
74416,L401232,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,What?
74417,L401231,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,What?
74418,L401216,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
74419,L401215,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life."
74420,L401200,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,And then he'll be coming after Evy.
74421,L401199,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
74422,L401198,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Yes, I know, I do that to people."
74423,L401197,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap."
74424,L401196,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,That looked rather painful.
74425,L401139,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
74426,L401138,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Who's here!?
74427,L401063,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!"
74428,L401062,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
74429,L401044,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
74430,L401043,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
74431,L401035,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer."
74432,L401034,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,You did not!?... We're not!?
74433,L401029,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"If he decides to wake up, hell yes!"
74434,L401028,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,What are you going to do? Shoot him?
74435,L401027,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Where's my gun?
74436,L401015,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?"
74437,L401014,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Tough break.
74438,L400944,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,"
74439,L400943,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out."
74440,L400929,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
74441,L400928,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?"
74442,L400922,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
74443,L400921,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
74444,L400920,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,None taken.
74445,L400902,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,And it stinks to high heaven in here.
74446,L400901,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
74447,L400893,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Be nice. That thing saved my life.
74448,L400892,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,That thing gives me the creeps.
74449,L400860,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,Awfully.
74450,L400859,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?"
74451,L400858,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister."
74452,L400857,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
74453,L400800,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"I only gamble with my life, never my money."
74454,L400799,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player."
74455,L400727,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"Um, well, you see..."
74456,L400726,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Hey,... don't I know you?"
74457,L400716,u2209,m142,O'CONNELL,"Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss."
74458,L400715,u2208,m142,JONATHAN,"She's my sister, actually."
74459,L405150,u2211,m143,AMAZING,What --?
74460,L405149,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
74461,L405148,u2211,m143,AMAZING,And what's that?
74462,L405147,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Except for one little thing.
74463,L405146,u2211,m143,AMAZING,Um-hmm.
74464,L405145,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,"I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?"
74465,L405144,u2211,m143,AMAZING,And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
74466,L405142,u2211,m143,AMAZING,I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
74467,L405141,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Really?
74468,L405140,u2211,m143,AMAZING,"The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to."
74469,L405138,u2211,m143,AMAZING,Of course.
74470,L405137,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
74471,L405136,u2211,m143,AMAZING,I know you knew I'd know.
74472,L405135,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I knew you'd know.
74473,L405134,u2211,m143,AMAZING,I know you did.
74474,L405133,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
74475,L405786,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,"I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride."
74476,L405785,u2212,m143,ANABEL,Do I?
74477,L405784,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,"Darling, you've got the wrong idea."
74478,L405783,u2212,m143,ANABEL,You two timing psychotic bastard.
74479,L405711,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I'll be down in a jiffy.
74480,L405710,u2212,m143,ANABEL,Our guests are waiting.
74481,L405704,u2212,m143,ANABEL,One last tweak.
74482,L405703,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I thought you were done?
74483,L405702,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Fantasizing... about you.
74484,L405701,u2212,m143,ANABEL,What are you doing all alone in the dark?
74485,L405485,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Head hunting.
74486,L405484,u2212,m143,ANABEL,Where are you going?
74487,L405186,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,"Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us?"
74488,L405185,u2212,m143,ANABEL,Your mind is so slippery.
74489,L405184,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,It must have slipped my mind.
74490,L405183,u2212,m143,ANABEL,Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
74491,L405182,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Everything's going exactly as we planned.
74492,L405841,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
74493,L405840,u2213,m143,BOWLER,"Hey, do I look like a Man?"
74494,L405754,u2213,m143,BOWLER,"Atta, boy!"
74495,L405753,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,"Atta, girl!"
74496,L405752,u2213,m143,BOWLER,"Do it, big boy!"
74497,L405751,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,"Come on, baby!"
74498,L405616,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,And some sandwiches --
74499,L405615,u2213,m143,BOWLER,We could really use some coffee --
74500,L405438,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Then Captain Amazing appeared.
74501,L405437,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Much less go outside.
74502,L405406,u2213,m143,BOWLER,I was eight.
74503,L405405,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,When was that?
74504,L405404,u2213,m143,BOWLER,He was the last time I saw him.
74505,L405401,u2213,m143,BOWLER,My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
74506,L405400,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,We didn't think this through very well.
74507,L405318,u2213,m143,BOWLER,The Disco Boys.
74508,L405317,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,So who killed him?
74509,L405316,u2213,m143,BOWLER,"And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do."
74510,L405310,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Really?
74511,L405309,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,"Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing."
74512,L405308,u2213,m143,BOWLER,I'm his daughter.
74513,L405307,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
74514,L405620,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Or even what it looks like.
74515,L405619,u2220,m143,RAJA,But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
74516,L405611,u2220,m143,RAJA,Let's do it.
74517,L405610,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Sounds good to me.
74518,L405603,u2213,m143,BOWLER,They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
74519,L405602,u2220,m143,RAJA,No one will believe us.
74520,L405377,u2213,m143,BOWLER,"Come on, Junior, it's a school night."
74521,L405376,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Me, too."
74522,L405375,u2213,m143,BOWLER,It's late. I'm headin' home.
74523,L405370,u2220,m143,RAJA,But in fact... you'd found it.
74524,L405369,u2213,m143,BOWLER,I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
74525,L405368,u2220,m143,RAJA,The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
74526,L405367,u2213,m143,BOWLER,But you're a superhero.
74527,L405366,u2220,m143,RAJA,"I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law."
74528,L405362,u2220,m143,RAJA,I can't.
74529,L405361,u2213,m143,BOWLER,But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
74530,L405332,u2220,m143,RAJA,The Inscrutable Six?
74531,L405331,u2213,m143,BOWLER,How about... the Savage Six?
74532,L405328,u2220,m143,RAJA,But they all had one thing we haven't got.
74533,L405327,u2213,m143,BOWLER,He was cute though.
74534,L405326,u2220,m143,RAJA,And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
74535,L405306,u2213,m143,BOWLER,I'm the Bowler.
74536,L405305,u2220,m143,RAJA,Who are you?
74537,L405845,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
74538,L405844,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Eat your mustard.
74539,L405666,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Sure.
74540,L405665,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Hey... you okay?
74541,L405647,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Hello?
74542,L405646,u2213,m143,BOWLER,"Mon Captain, it's for you."
74543,L405537,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,I dunno.
74544,L405536,u2213,m143,BOWLER,What did he mean?
74545,L405535,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
74546,L405323,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Half a Dirty Dozen!
74547,L405322,u2213,m143,BOWLER,That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
74548,L405314,u2213,m143,BOWLER,I thought you'd never ask.
74549,L405313,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
74550,L405780,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Think positive.
74551,L405779,u2216,m143,HELLER,He'll never make it.
74552,L405685,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Get on to yourself!
74553,L405684,u2216,m143,HELLER,Snap out of it!
74554,L405417,u2216,m143,HELLER,"Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --"
74555,L405416,u2213,m143,BOWLER,"Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help."
74556,L405415,u2216,m143,HELLER,Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
74557,L405414,u2213,m143,BOWLER,He's dead.
74558,L405413,u2216,m143,HELLER,How's your dad?
74559,L405412,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Thanks.

74563,L405408,u2213,m143,BOWLER,Doctor Heller?

74565,L405357,u2223,m143,TONY P,And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
74566,L405356,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,That boy's got talent.
74567,L405202,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Why bother?
74568,L405201,u2223,m143,TONY P,Should I kill them?
74569,L405200,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Superheroes.
74570,L405131,u2223,m143,TONY P,What about Captain Amazing?

74572,L405129,u2223,m143,TONY P,"But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge."
74573,L405128,u2223,m143,TONY P,"You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King..."
74574,L405127,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Have you considered my offer?
74575,L405126,u2223,m143,TONY P,Ummm.
74576,L405125,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
74577,L405801,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
74578,L405800,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
74579,L405798,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Frankenstein!
74580,L405797,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,And the light goes out...
74581,L405523,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,So are you!
74582,L405522,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,You're dead.
74583,L405521,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
74584,L405519,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Too bad. PLUG HIM!
74585,L405518,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Against.
74586,L405517,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Are you with me... or against me?
74587,L405516,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,And the nuts always call themselves great.
74588,L405515,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,They always call the great ones nuts.
74589,L405514,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,You're nuts.
74590,L405513,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,"I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?"
74591,L405346,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Captain who?
74592,L405345,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,What did you do with Captain Amazing?
74593,L405720,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Or you'll what? CAN ME?
74594,L405719,u2218,m143,MONICA,Stay away!
74595,L405717,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Roy.
74596,L405716,u2218,m143,MONICA,Who?
74597,L405715,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I saw him walk you home.
74598,L405714,u2218,m143,MONICA,What?
74599,L405713,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,You're a spy.
74600,L405712,u2218,m143,MONICA,I'd better go.
74601,L405700,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Remember the cat.
74602,L405699,u2218,m143,MONICA,Curiosity.
74603,L405698,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Then why are you here?
74604,L405697,u2218,m143,MONICA,I'm not that kind of girl.
74605,L405696,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Come here.
74606,L405675,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Me.
74607,L405674,u2218,m143,MONICA,Who's the artist?
74608,L405671,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Why not?
74609,L405670,u2218,m143,MONICA,"How 'bout giving me ""the tour""?"
74610,L405669,u2218,m143,MONICA,Just wanted to... powder my nose.
74611,L405668,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I thought you'd chickened out on me.
74612,L405667,u2218,m143,MONICA,Hi.
74613,L405564,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Terrific.
74614,L405563,u2218,m143,MONICA,Sure -- I guess.
74615,L405562,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
74616,L405561,u2218,m143,MONICA,Really?
74617,L405560,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,"You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for."
74618,L405559,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,You underestimate yourself.
74619,L405558,u2218,m143,MONICA,Just a waitress.
74620,L405557,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,Are you an actress?
74621,L405556,u2218,m143,MONICA,Really?
74622,L405555,u2214,m143,CASANOVA,"I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in ""The Blue Dahlia""."
74623,L405662,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Monica!
74624,L405661,u2218,m143,MONICA,Bye.
74625,L405660,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,What?
74626,L405659,u2218,m143,MONICA,"Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful."
74627,L405658,u2218,m143,MONICA,"Then at least I will have died trying, right?"
74628,L405657,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,And what if you get killed?
74629,L405656,u2218,m143,MONICA,Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
74630,L405655,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
74631,L405654,u2218,m143,MONICA,"Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing."
74632,L405653,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,What are you talking about?
74633,L405652,u2218,m143,MONICA,I'm going inside.
74634,L405651,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Are you nuts? Get out of there!
74635,L405650,u2218,m143,MONICA,At the Frankenstein Center.
74636,L405649,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Monica, where are you?"
74637,L405648,u2218,m143,MONICA,It's me.
74638,L405508,u2218,m143,MONICA,"That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy."
74639,L405507,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,I just want to be a superhero.
74640,L405506,u2218,m143,MONICA,You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
74641,L405505,u2218,m143,MONICA,You don't seem very angry right now.
74642,L405504,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Me, too."
74643,L405503,u2218,m143,MONICA,"Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does."
74644,L405502,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,What have they got that we ain't got?
74645,L405501,u2218,m143,MONICA,"I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but..."
74646,L405500,u2218,m143,MONICA,Yeah.
74647,L405499,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,It's home.
74648,L405498,u2218,m143,MONICA,Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
74649,L405497,u2218,m143,MONICA,Have you always lived here?
74650,L405496,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Roy.
74651,L405495,u2218,m143,MONICA,What's your real name?
74652,L405494,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
74653,L405493,u2218,m143,MONICA,"I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress."
74654,L405492,u2218,m143,MONICA,Who wouldn't?
74655,L405491,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,I wouldn't mind being famous.
74656,L405490,u2218,m143,MONICA,"Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people."
74657,L405489,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,It is?
74658,L405488,u2218,m143,MONICA,"Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish."
74659,L405487,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Why?
74660,L405486,u2218,m143,MONICA,I admire you.
74661,L405480,u2218,m143,MONICA,That was easy.
74662,L405479,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Sure.
74663,L405478,u2218,m143,MONICA,I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
74664,L405477,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Yeah.
74665,L405476,u2218,m143,MONICA,Date?
74666,L405475,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
74667,L405468,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Every night.
74668,L405467,u2218,m143,MONICA,Alone tonight?
74669,L405466,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Hi.
74670,L405100,u2218,m143,MONICA,Not tonight.
74671,L405099,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Or talk?
74672,L405097,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
74673,L405096,u2218,m143,MONICA,I guess... Are you always so angry?
74674,L405095,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
74675,L405276,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Good or evil, what's the difference?"
74676,L405275,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,"Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil."
74677,L405249,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,"I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?"
74678,L405248,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --"
74679,L405247,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,I just know.
74680,L405246,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
74681,L405239,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,Yes.
74682,L405238,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again."
74683,L405235,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,Yes.
74684,L405234,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible."
74685,L405678,u2222,m143,SPHINX,He is in love. His anger is gone.
74686,L405677,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever."
74687,L405609,u2222,m143,SPHINX,Now you're talking.
74688,L405608,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!"
74689,L405607,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny..."
74690,L405452,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos!"
74691,L405451,u2222,m143,SPHINX,It is not dead. It is hiding.
74692,L405450,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,My heart died a long time ago.
74693,L405449,u2222,m143,SPHINX,"Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart."
74694,L405446,u2222,m143,SPHINX,When I am sure I am among friends.
74695,L405445,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,When are you going to take off that mask?
74696,L405444,u2222,m143,SPHINX,You drink too much.
74697,L405443,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,And a skunk stinks!
74698,L405442,u2222,m143,SPHINX,The wise snake coils before he strikes.
74699,L405441,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!"
74700,L405391,u2222,m143,SPHINX,And you are a fool.
74701,L405390,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,You're the Sphinx.
74702,L405763,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,With what?
74703,L405762,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Cover me!
74704,L405725,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Not a chance!
74705,L405724,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,I'll drive.
74706,L405723,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Are you coming or not?
74707,L405722,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,But she still might call!
74708,L405695,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved."
74709,L405694,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
74710,L405687,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,But I just don't feel it.
74711,L405686,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,GET MAD!
74712,L405544,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Because that's what it is.
74713,L405543,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,This place is built like a fortress.
74714,L405396,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,He's got the fact that he's Superman!
74715,L405395,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,So what else has Superman got?
74716,L405321,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,SO WHAT?
74717,L405320,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,But there's still only six of us.
74718,L405319,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
74719,L405278,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
74720,L405277,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,There's a big difference.
74721,L405260,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause..."
74722,L405259,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,There's just not enough of us.
74723,L405233,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Yeah.
74724,L405232,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,You sure that's how you spell it?
74725,L405225,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Good point.
74726,L405224,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,How could I see him if he's invisible?
74727,L405223,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Have you ever seen him?
74728,L405218,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
74729,L405217,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,I'm liking this.
74730,L405214,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Yeah yeah -- and that, too."
74731,L405213,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,And it would be the right thing to do.
74732,L405210,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
74733,L405209,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,What are you talking about?
74734,L405068,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,So when are we gonna have an on night?
74735,L405067,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"We had an off night, that's all."
74736,L405066,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,"Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours."
74737,L405050,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,LOOK!
74738,L405049,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Oh don't start that again --
74739,L405689,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?"
74740,L405688,u2220,m143,RAJA,He's turned into a completely normal person!
74741,L405546,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Come on.
74742,L405545,u2220,m143,RAJA,What's that?
74743,L405542,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,He hasn't stolen it yet.
74744,L405541,u2220,m143,RAJA,So where's the art?
74745,L405448,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!"
74746,L405447,u2220,m143,RAJA,Roy --
74747,L405280,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Oh shut up.
74748,L405279,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you."
74749,L405274,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
74750,L405273,u2220,m143,RAJA,Maybe there was traffic.
74751,L405230,u2220,m143,RAJA,"No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station."
74752,L405229,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Sounds good.
74753,L405216,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!"
74754,L405215,u2220,m143,RAJA,"But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal."
74755,L405212,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!"
74756,L405211,u2220,m143,RAJA,Agents?
74757,L405208,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
74758,L405207,u2220,m143,RAJA,Maybe she's right.
74759,L405192,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Shhh.
74760,L405191,u2220,m143,RAJA,I'm soaked.  Oh great.
74761,L405176,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Well they've crawled back out.
74762,L405175,u2220,m143,RAJA,The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
74763,L405174,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,The who?
74764,L405170,u2220,m143,RAJA,Wait!... Look!
74765,L405169,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Let's go.
74766,L405162,u2220,m143,RAJA,But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
74767,L405161,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
74768,L405104,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,See ya tomorrow.
74769,L405103,u2220,m143,RAJA,Or flowers.
74770,L405102,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
74771,L405101,u2220,m143,RAJA,Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
74772,L405094,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Who's chicken?
74773,L405093,u2220,m143,RAJA,So you're chicken?
74774,L405092,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
74775,L405091,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?"
74776,L405090,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Nah.
74777,L405065,u2220,m143,RAJA,Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
74778,L405064,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Why not?
74779,L405063,u2220,m143,RAJA,I can't.
74780,L405062,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,So why don't you just tell her!
74781,L405061,u2220,m143,RAJA,"I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it."
74782,L405060,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
74783,L405058,u2220,m143,RAJA,But look at him... and look at us.
74784,L405057,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,"We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!"
74785,L405053,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
74786,L405052,u2220,m143,RAJA,There's a vague similarity.
74787,L405051,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
74788,L405048,u2215,m143,FURIOUS,What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
74789,L405047,u2220,m143,RAJA,"He doesn't miss a trick, does he?"
74790,L405847,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,Hey... he's gone.
74791,L405846,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Yes, Obie-wan."
74792,L405399,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,Anybody got any?
74793,L405398,u2220,m143,RAJA,Firepower costs money.
74794,L405336,u2220,m143,RAJA,The Eradicators!
74795,L405335,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,The Obliterators!
74796,L405245,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,Yes.
74797,L405244,u2220,m143,RAJA,"So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?"
74798,L405241,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,No.
74799,L405240,u2220,m143,RAJA,So you're only invisible... to yourself?
74800,L405237,u2217,m143,INVISIBLE BOY,Yes.
74801,L405236,u2220,m143,RAJA,But... only when no one is looking.
74802,L405205,u2218,m143,MONICA,Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
74803,L405204,u2220,m143,RAJA,Ow.
74804,L405203,u2218,m143,MONICA,Here you go.
74805,L405086,u2220,m143,RAJA,Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
74806,L405085,u2218,m143,MONICA,So what can I get you?
74807,L405084,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional."
74808,L405083,u2218,m143,MONICA,Really?
74809,L405080,u2220,m143,RAJA,"And these are my associates, the Shoveler."
74810,L405079,u2218,m143,MONICA,Wow.
74811,L405078,u2220,m143,RAJA,"We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware..."
74812,L405077,u2218,m143,MONICA,So you're like... struggling superheroes?
74813,L405076,u2220,m143,RAJA,Not yet.
74814,L405075,u2218,m143,MONICA,Are you famous?
74815,L405074,u2218,m143,MONICA,Really? Like Captain Amazing?
74816,L405073,u2220,m143,RAJA,We're superheroes.
74817,L405072,u2218,m143,MONICA,You guys going to a costume party?
74818,L405640,u2219,m143,MOTHER,Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
74819,L405639,u2220,m143,RAJA,You did?
74820,L405638,u2219,m143,MOTHER,I always knew that you were special.
74821,L405637,u2220,m143,RAJA,It is?
74822,L405636,u2219,m143,MOTHER,Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
74823,L405635,u2220,m143,RAJA,I use it... to fight evil.
74824,L405634,u2219,m143,MOTHER,But... the silverware?
74825,L405633,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!"
74826,L405632,u2220,m143,RAJA,Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
74827,L405631,u2219,m143,MOTHER,And why are you wearing that silly costume?
74828,L405630,u2220,m143,RAJA,Mother... it's not what you think!
74829,L405629,u2219,m143,MOTHER,"Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!"
74830,L405121,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy."
74831,L405120,u2219,m143,MOTHER,It's on the television.
74832,L405119,u2220,m143,RAJA,Looking for... the TV Guide.
74833,L405118,u2219,m143,MOTHER,What are you doing in the silver drawer?
74834,L405117,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Oh hi, Mom."
74835,L405116,u2219,m143,MOTHER,Jeffrey!
74836,L405759,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Right.
74837,L405758,u2220,m143,RAJA,Through there!
74838,L405757,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Where am I going?
74839,L405731,u2220,m143,RAJA,May the forks be with us!
74840,L405730,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,We've got lift off!
74841,L405709,u2220,m143,RAJA,"With or without him, we gotta go!"
74842,L405708,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,It's time.
74843,L405680,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Great timing!
74844,L405679,u2220,m143,RAJA,Oh no.
74845,L405606,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,It's suicide.
74846,L405605,u2220,m143,RAJA,We're outnumbered twenty to one.
74847,L405567,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
74848,L405566,u2220,m143,RAJA,That was too close.
74849,L405539,u2220,m143,RAJA,But how do we get in?
74850,L405538,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
74851,L405440,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
74852,L405439,u2220,m143,RAJA,He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
74853,L405436,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
74854,L405435,u2220,m143,RAJA,"Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king."
74855,L405422,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,The bazookas?
74856,L405421,u2220,m143,RAJA,"But, Doc... where's the machine guns?"
74857,L405403,u2220,m143,RAJA,Are you sure he's still alive?
74858,L405402,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Are you sure he's still lives here?
74859,L405359,u2220,m143,RAJA,Whatever our name is.
74860,L405358,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,To us!
74861,L405262,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,"Yeah, but how do we get to them?"
74862,L405261,u2220,m143,RAJA,And a social life.
74863,L405228,u2220,m143,RAJA,He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
74864,L405227,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,The who?
74865,L405226,u2220,m143,RAJA,And there's the Sphinx.
74866,L405222,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,"I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible."
74867,L405221,u2220,m143,RAJA,Do we have to?
74868,L405194,u2220,m143,RAJA,Shut up.
74869,L405193,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Be a Mohican.
74870,L405189,u2220,m143,RAJA,Be a Mohican.
74871,L405188,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Sorry.
74872,L405187,u2220,m143,RAJA,Don't crunch the leaves.
74873,L405180,u2220,m143,RAJA,Or both.
74874,L405179,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Or Batman --
74875,L405178,u2220,m143,RAJA,This looks like a job for Superman --
74876,L405177,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,We may be getting in over our heads here.
74877,L405173,u2220,m143,RAJA,The Disco Boys.
74878,L405172,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Who are they?
74879,L405171,u2220,m143,RAJA,This is bad.
74880,L405089,u2220,m143,RAJA,Ask her out.
74881,L405088,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Definitely.
74882,L405087,u2220,m143,RAJA,She likes you.
74883,L405082,u2220,m143,RAJA,And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
74884,L405081,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,Hi.
74885,L405056,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
74886,L405055,u2220,m143,RAJA,We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
74887,L405054,u2221,m143,SHOVELER,"Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?"
74888,L406493,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people."
74889,L406492,u2229,m144,CAULAINCOURT,"Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail."
74890,L406490,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy."
74891,L406489,u2229,m144,CAULAINCOURT,"I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England."
74892,L406488,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies."
74893,L406487,u2229,m144,CAULAINCOURT,"I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected."
74894,L406486,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to."
74895,L406485,u2229,m144,CAULAINCOURT,"But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty."
74896,L406484,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance."
74897,L406571,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"I am at your disposal, Your Majesty."
74898,L406570,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration."
74899,L406569,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia."
74900,L406568,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck."
74901,L406567,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,What do you think Napoleon will do?
74902,L406566,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness."
74903,L406565,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,Proceed.
74904,L406564,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness."
74905,L406563,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again."
74906,L406562,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?"
74907,L406561,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter."
74908,L406560,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?"
74909,L406559,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground."
74910,L406557,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
74911,L406556,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Ah, yes -- proceed."
74912,L406555,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it."
74913,L406554,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point."
74914,L406553,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that."
74915,L406552,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army."
74916,L406551,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?"
74917,L406550,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct."
74918,L406549,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time."
74919,L406548,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on."
74920,L406547,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
74921,L406546,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police."
74922,L406545,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death."
74923,L406544,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,Proceed.
74924,L406543,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle."
74925,L406542,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like."
74926,L406541,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion."
74927,L406540,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
74928,L406539,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it."
74929,L406538,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?"
74930,L406537,u2236,m144,GENERAL KUTUSOV,"I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait."
74931,L406385,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
74932,L406384,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What do you mean?
74933,L406383,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are."
74934,L406382,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. ""Berthier sees only what is in the open,"" Murat said.  ""But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest.""  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment."
74935,L406381,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?"
74936,L406380,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down."
74937,L406373,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one."
74938,L406372,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,Whatever suggested the idea to you?
74939,L406371,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I'm glad you like it.
74940,L406370,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,I think it's absolutely charming.
74941,L406369,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Ah -- you approve?
74942,L406368,u2224,m144,ALEXANDER,"And, what a delightful idea!"
74943,L406367,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander."
74944,L405993,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now."
74945,L405992,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Our lives, the revolution, my career?"
74946,L405991,u2225,m144,BARRAS,You realize what is at stake?
74947,L405990,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I'm not insulted.
74948,L405989,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses."
74949,L405988,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Fair enough.
74950,L405987,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command."
74951,L405986,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
74952,L405985,u2225,m144,BARRAS,Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
74953,L405984,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant."
74954,L405983,u2225,m144,BARRAS,These are odds of 8 to 1.
74955,L405982,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Properly arranged, yes."
74956,L405981,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?"
74957,L405980,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,You could have them here by daybreak.
74958,L405979,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons."
74959,L405978,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Where are they?
74960,L405977,u2225,m144,BARRAS,There are none here.
74961,L405976,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Any cannon?
74962,L405975,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers."
74963,L405974,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Cavalry?
74964,L405973,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"About 5,000 troops."
74965,L405972,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What forces do you have at your disposal?
74966,L405971,u2225,m144,BARRAS,I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
74967,L405970,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Are you serious?
74968,L405969,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea."
74969,L405968,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What do you have in mind?
74970,L405967,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense."
74971,L405966,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Things are quite serious, I should say."
74972,L405965,u2225,m144,BARRAS,I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
74973,L405964,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"No, thank you."
74974,L405963,u2225,m144,BARRAS,Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
74975,L405962,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel."
74976,L405961,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down."
74977,L405934,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,May I come to the map?
74978,L405933,u2225,m144,BARRAS,Please...
74979,L405932,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras."
74980,L405931,u2225,m144,BARRAS,"Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?"
74981,L405930,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I did, sir."
74982,L405929,u2225,m144,BARRAS,Yes -- who spoke up?
74983,L406618,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard."
74984,L406617,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
74985,L406616,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,And where is Joseph?
74986,L406615,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"I don't know, sire."
74987,L406614,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
74988,L406613,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
74989,L406612,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,But who made this treaty?
74990,L406611,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau."
74991,L406610,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
74992,L406609,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris."
74993,L406605,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements."
74994,L406604,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
74995,L406603,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"Unhappily, it is true, sire."
74996,L406602,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
74997,L406601,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates."
74998,L406600,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,And who is defending Paris?
74999,L406599,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"It is on this road, sire, following me."
75000,L406598,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,And where is the army?
75001,L406597,u2226,m144,BELLIARD,"They are at the gates of Paris, sire."
75002,L406596,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?"
75003,L406706,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms."
75004,L406705,u2227,m144,BERTRAND,"No, sire... I was asleep."
75005,L406704,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?"
75006,L406703,u2227,m144,BERTRAND,"Yes, sire?"
75007,L406702,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
75008,L406701,u2227,m144,BERTRAND,"Bertrand, sire."
75009,L406700,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Who is there?
75010,L406641,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?"
75011,L406640,u2227,m144,BERTRAND,I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
75012,L406639,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead."
75013,L406638,u2227,m144,BERTRAND,That is incredible.
75014,L406637,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
75015,L406636,u2227,m144,BERTRAND,"I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician."
75016,L406635,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
75017,L406634,u2227,m144,BERTRAND,It is a terrible shock.
75018,L406633,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
75019,L406173,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Let me see it.
75020,L406172,u2228,m144,BOURRIENNE,"This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only."
75021,L406171,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Come in.
75022,L406170,u2228,m144,BOURRIENNE,"Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention."
75023,L406169,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Come back in an hour.
75024,L406168,u2228,m144,BOURRIENNE,General Bonaparte?
75025,L406107,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Oh, shit, that's not right."
75026,L406106,u2228,m144,BOURRIENNE,"To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?"
75027,L406105,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Read it back.
75028,L406079,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You may go, Captain Charles."
75029,L406078,u2230,m144,CHARLES,"Thank you, sir.  I will do that."
75030,L406077,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
75031,L406076,u2230,m144,CHARLES,"Thank you, sir."
75032,L406075,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed."
75033,L406074,u2230,m144,CHARLES,"No, sir, none at all."
75034,L406073,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
75035,L406072,u2230,m144,CHARLES,"Yes, sir."
75036,L406071,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Was the trip normal in every respect?
75037,L406070,u2230,m144,CHARLES,"Yes, sir."
75038,L406069,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
75039,L406068,u2230,m144,CHARLES,"Yes, sir, I am."
75040,L406067,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp."
75041,L406066,u2230,m144,CHARLES,"Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris."
75042,L406065,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot."
75043,L405954,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I see...
75044,L405953,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,"Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions."
75045,L405952,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,"I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night."
75046,L405951,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Ah-hh, no."
75047,L405950,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,"You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?"
75048,L405949,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, as a matter of fact, it is."
75049,L405948,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,"That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?"
75050,L405947,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"No, they're living in Nice now."
75051,L405946,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
75052,L405945,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I haven't been there for three years.
75053,L405944,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,Have you been back recently?
75054,L405943,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Ajaccio.
75055,L405942,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,Bastia -- and you?
75056,L405941,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Oh -- where do you come from?
75057,L405940,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,"I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena."
75058,L405939,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, I am."
75059,L405938,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,"Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?"
75060,L405937,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"A glass of champagne, please."
75061,L405936,u2231,m144,CORSICAN,"Yes, sir?"
75062,L406587,u2247,m144,PICART,My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
75063,L406586,u2232,m144,DIDIER,"When you eat him, may I have some?"
75064,L406585,u2247,m144,PICART,His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
75065,L406584,u2232,m144,DIDIER,Why are you carrying the dog?
75066,L406583,u2247,m144,PICART,"Ah, Didier -- you are alive."
75067,L406582,u2232,m144,DIDIER,"Hello there, Picart."
75068,L406536,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed."
75069,L406535,u2233,m144,DUROC,"From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city."
75070,L406534,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people."
75071,L406533,u2233,m144,DUROC,"We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police."
75072,L406532,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Impossible, I don't believe it."
75073,L406531,u2233,m144,DUROC,Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
75074,L406530,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
75075,L406529,u2233,m144,DUROC,It is the work of incendiaries.
75076,L406528,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,How did it spread so quickly?
75077,L406527,u2233,m144,DUROC,"At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire."
75078,L406526,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Why didn't you wake me then?
75079,L406525,u2233,m144,DUROC,The first reports came in at about ten.
75080,L406524,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,When did it start?
75081,L406523,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"My God, what a fire!"
75082,L406522,u2233,m144,DUROC,Four o'clock.
75083,L406521,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,My God...!  What time is it?
75084,L406428,u2233,m144,DUROC,"May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries."
75085,L406427,u2249,m144,SCHWARZENBURG,"But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this."
75086,L406426,u2233,m144,DUROC,"No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again."
75087,L406425,u2249,m144,SCHWARZENBURG,"But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?"
75088,L406424,u2233,m144,DUROC,"Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes."
75089,L406423,u2249,m144,SCHWARZENBURG,What is that?
75090,L406422,u2233,m144,DUROC,"The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise."
75091,L406421,u2249,m144,SCHWARZENBURG,Oh?
75092,L406420,u2233,m144,DUROC,"I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is."
75093,L406419,u2249,m144,SCHWARZENBURG,"Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow."
75094,L406418,u2233,m144,DUROC,"Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?"
75095,L406417,u2249,m144,SCHWARZENBURG,"Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall."
75096,L406416,u2233,m144,DUROC,"Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?"
75097,L406023,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?"
75098,L406022,u2234,m144,EUGENE,My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
75099,L406021,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend."
75100,L406020,u2234,m144,EUGENE,"No, sir."
75101,L406019,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Does your mother know you have come?
75102,L406018,u2234,m144,EUGENE,He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
75103,L406017,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,And he sent you to me?
75104,L406016,u2234,m144,EUGENE,"I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory."
75105,L406015,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
75106,L406014,u2234,m144,EUGENE,"This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory."
75107,L406013,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,That is correct.
75108,L406012,u2234,m144,EUGENE,I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
75109,L406011,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I have met her.  What is your business with me?
75110,L406010,u2234,m144,EUGENE,"Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?"
75111,L406009,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?"
75112,L406008,u2234,m144,EUGENE,"Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?"
75113,L406007,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais."
75114,L406359,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom."
75115,L406358,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,No -- not as a rule.
75116,L406357,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?"
75117,L406356,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,"Thank you, Napoleon."
75118,L406354,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I'll have the fire built up.
75119,L406353,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,Thank you.
75120,L406352,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Would you like some brandy?
75121,L406351,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,"I'm afraid I am, just a bit."
75122,L406350,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable."
75123,L406349,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,"But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army..."
75124,L406348,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I see.
75125,L406347,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
75126,L406346,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Oh...?
75127,L406345,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,I very much doubt that he will.
75128,L406344,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Will Alexander be joining us soon?
75129,L406343,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,Yes -- an excellent idea.
75130,L406342,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Shall we move closer to the fire?
75131,L406341,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
75132,L406340,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month."
75133,L406339,u2235,m144,FRANCIS,I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
75134,L406338,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last."
75135,L405901,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Oh, yes... of course."
75136,L405900,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill."
75137,L405899,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
75138,L405898,u2237,m144,GIRL,Lisette La Croix.
75139,L405897,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Only Lisette?
75140,L405896,u2237,m144,GIRL,Lisette.
75141,L405895,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What's your name?
75142,L405894,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Oh, I'm sorry about that."
75143,L405893,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice."
75144,L405892,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Do you have three francs, sir?"
75145,L405891,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money."
75146,L405890,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?"
75147,L405889,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street."
75148,L405888,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Is it a nice warm room, sir?"
75149,L405887,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
75150,L405886,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Are you staying with a friend, sir?"
75151,L405885,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence."
75152,L405884,u2237,m144,GIRL,"One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?"
75153,L405883,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Oh, I see... That must be a great burden."
75154,L405882,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me."
75155,L405881,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Then what brings you out on such a night?
75156,L405880,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Yes, I am, sir."
75157,L405879,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this."
75158,L405878,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Yes, it must be."
75159,L405877,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter."
75160,L405876,u2237,m144,GIRL,"The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?"
75161,L405875,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Good evening, Mademoiselle."
75162,L405874,u2237,m144,GIRL,"Good evening, sir."
75163,L406251,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
75164,L406250,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,Will you use the troops?
75165,L406199,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife."
75166,L406198,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
75167,L406197,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked."
75168,L406196,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,When is she supposed to return?
75169,L406195,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, you shall see."
75170,L406194,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,"Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder."
75171,L406193,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Are you trying to insult me?
75172,L406192,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
75173,L406191,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her."
75174,L406190,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
75175,L406189,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
75176,L406188,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,You must not act impetuously.
75177,L406187,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
75178,L406186,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
75179,L406185,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I know of no better time.
75180,L406184,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,"You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters."
75181,L406183,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts."
75182,L406092,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"And you, Junot?"
75183,L406091,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,"Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this."
75184,L406090,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?"
75185,L406089,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,"No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other."
75186,L406088,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Not even the slightest hint of something?
75187,L406087,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,No... nothing at all.
75188,L406084,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Junot?
75189,L406083,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,No...
75190,L406082,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?"
75191,L406081,u2238,m144,JOSEPH,"To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned."
75192,L406080,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
75193,L406470,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness."
75194,L406469,u2243,m144,MONTESQUIOU,"And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness."
75195,L406468,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Ah, that is good."
75196,L406467,u2243,m144,MONTESQUIOU,"I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child."
75197,L406466,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
75198,L406465,u2243,m144,MONTESQUIOU,"I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet."
75199,L406464,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress."
75200,L406331,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success."
75201,L406330,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins."
75202,L406329,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise."
75203,L406328,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
75204,L406325,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,It's me.
75205,L406324,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Who is it?
75206,L406323,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
75207,L406322,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
75208,L406321,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,But you will not... be safe...
75209,L406320,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Yes.
75210,L406319,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Separate bedrooms?
75211,L406311,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Goodbye.
75212,L406310,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Five minutes.
75213,L406309,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Yes!!
75214,L406308,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Five minutes.
75215,L406307,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
75216,L406306,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Will you be joining us, soon?"
75217,L406305,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once."
75218,L406304,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,What are you doing in there?
75219,L406303,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
75220,L406302,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Where is Madame Trillaud?
75221,L406301,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
75222,L406300,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,I know what you're doing in there.
75223,L406299,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Go away -- I'm busy.
75224,L406298,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Open the door.  It's me.
75225,L406297,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Yes -- what is it?
75226,L406230,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,You are my old friend.
75227,L406229,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,All right -- I promise.
75228,L406228,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway."
75229,L406227,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Promises mean nothing.
75230,L406226,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Promise.
75231,L406225,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I don't understand you.
75232,L406224,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"I don't care, but promise you will never leave me."
75233,L406223,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I will never forgive you.
75234,L406222,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Promise me.
75235,L406221,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I cannot promise you that.
75236,L406220,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Promise me you will never leave me.
75237,L406219,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy."
75238,L406218,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,She must have been in love with you.
75239,L406217,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
75240,L406216,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Were any of them married?
75241,L406215,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,One had better legs.
75242,L406214,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Were any of them prettier than I am?
75243,L406213,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Yes.
75244,L406212,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Were they pretty?
75245,L406211,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,No.
75246,L406210,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Were you in love with any of them?
75247,L406209,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Of course.
75248,L406208,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,But you have had mistresses while you were away.
75249,L406207,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,No.
75250,L406206,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"And you, are you in love with any one else?"
75251,L406205,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Yes.
75252,L406204,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Do you expect me to believe that?
75253,L406203,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me."
75254,L406202,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,And now?
75255,L406201,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,I thought I was.  I was confused.
75256,L406200,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Were you in love with him?
75257,L406045,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!"
75258,L406044,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers."
75259,L406043,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
75260,L406040,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be."
75261,L406039,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you."
75262,L406038,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon."
75263,L406035,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?"
75264,L406034,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?"
75265,L406033,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here."
75266,L406032,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience."
75267,L406031,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,May I offer you a drink?
75268,L406030,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door."
75269,L406029,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?"
75270,L406028,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house."
75271,L406027,u2239,m144,JOSEPHINE,"Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down."
75272,L406167,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris."
75273,L406166,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
75274,L406165,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
75275,L406164,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"Yes, of course.  What do you want?"
75276,L406163,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Can you give me a drink, please?"
75277,L406162,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months."
75278,L406161,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,How did you know it was Captain Charles?
75279,L406160,u2240,m144,JUNOT,Yes.
75280,L406159,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,You mean you heard them making love?
75281,L406158,u2240,m144,JUNOT,Yes.
75282,L406157,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,You could hear them?
75283,L406155,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Yes?
75284,L406154,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's."
75285,L406153,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,How do you know?
75286,L406152,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I know.
75287,L406151,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,How do you know?
75288,L406150,u2240,m144,JUNOT,God help me -- yes.
75289,L406149,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Do you know what you're saying?
75290,L406148,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"My God, what do you think?"
75291,L406147,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What was there to tell?
75292,L406146,u2240,m144,JUNOT,About Hippolyte Charles.
75293,L406145,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,You couldn't face telling me what?
75294,L406144,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I couldn't face telling you.
75295,L406143,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,You wrote it.
75296,L406142,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"Yes, I wrote it."
75297,L406141,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What?
75298,L406140,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I wrote it.
75299,L406139,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Yes.
75300,L406138,u2240,m144,JUNOT,You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
75301,L406137,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!"
75302,L406136,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
75303,L406135,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What the hell is the matter with you?
75304,L406134,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
75305,L406133,u2240,m144,JUNOT,There are some things... better left unsaid.
75306,L406132,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself."
75307,L406131,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"Let's just say, he looks after your interests."
75308,L406130,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation."
75309,L406129,u2240,m144,JUNOT,That's all I can say.
75310,L406128,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
75311,L406127,u2240,m144,JUNOT,Nothing.  That's all I can say.
75312,L406126,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What are you talking about?
75313,L406125,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests."
75314,L406124,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Why not?
75315,L406123,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
75316,L406122,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Certainly.
75317,L406121,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?"
75318,L406120,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here."
75319,L406119,u2240,m144,JUNOT,He's downstairs -- somewhere.
75320,L406118,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
75321,L406117,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you."
75322,L406116,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier."
75323,L406115,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you."
75324,L406114,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Why did you give it to him?
75325,L406113,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
75326,L406112,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday."
75327,L406111,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife."
75328,L406110,u2240,m144,JUNOT,There's probably some explanation.
75329,L406109,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?"
75330,L406104,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment."
75331,L406103,u2240,m144,JUNOT,I believe you sent for me.
75332,L406086,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it."
75333,L406085,u2240,m144,JUNOT,"No, one cannot simply ignore it."
75334,L406481,u2248,m144,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,"If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur."
75335,L406480,u2241,m144,MAJOR FIDON,"If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?"
75336,L406479,u2248,m144,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,"Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia."
75337,L406478,u2241,m144,MAJOR FIDON,"May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me."
75338,L406477,u2248,m144,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,"No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way."
75339,L406476,u2241,m144,MAJOR FIDON,"Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?"
75340,L406475,u2248,m144,RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN,"My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road."
75341,L406474,u2241,m144,MAJOR FIDON,"Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?"
75342,L406460,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello."
75343,L406459,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,No.
75344,L406458,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
75345,L406457,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know."
75346,L406456,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
75347,L406455,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
75348,L406454,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,"Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender."
75349,L406453,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know."
75350,L406452,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,"Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much."
75351,L406451,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest."
75352,L406450,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,"I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn."
75353,L406449,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
75354,L406448,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
75355,L406447,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise."
75356,L406446,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
75357,L406445,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Of course, my dear."
75358,L406444,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
75359,L406443,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, I do -- very much."
75360,L406442,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,Do you like music?
75361,L406440,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,"You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures."
75362,L406439,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?"
75363,L406437,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn."
75364,L406436,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,"And, where did you see my portrait?"
75365,L406434,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband."
75366,L406433,u2242,m144,MARIE-LOUISE,"Oh, then you are..."
75367,L406432,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you."
75368,L406408,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
75369,L406407,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,"Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to."
75370,L406406,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,That is a matter of opinion.
75371,L406405,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,"I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear."
75372,L406404,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
75373,L406403,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,And where do you place Alexander?
75374,L406402,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force."
75375,L406401,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,What I am talking about is moderation.
75376,L406400,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield."
75377,L406399,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,"Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses."
75378,L406398,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,We have a treaty with Austria.
75379,L406397,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
75380,L406396,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia."
75381,L406395,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
75382,L406394,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,That is correct.
75383,L406393,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,"Now, the section headed ""Secret Clauses of the Treaty"" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade."
75384,L406392,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Yes, he has."
75385,L406391,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,Has Alexander agreed to this?
75386,L406390,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,I did not ask her to go to war against me.
75387,L406389,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,Those are extremely harsh terms.
75388,L406388,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Does she deserve anything better?
75389,L406387,u2250,m144,TALLEYRAND,"Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force."
75390,L405915,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot."
75391,L405914,u2251,m144,VARLAC,I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
75392,L405912,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart."
75393,L405911,u2251,m144,VARLAC,"Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform."
75394,L405910,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial."
75395,L405909,u2251,m144,VARLAC,"Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone."
75396,L405908,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men."
75397,L405907,u2251,m144,VARLAC,"A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin."
75398,L405905,u2251,m144,VARLAC,"Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac."
75399,L405904,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?"
75400,L405903,u2251,m144,VARLAC,Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
75401,L406262,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Send him in.
75402,L406261,u2246,m144,ORDERLY,"Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir."
75403,L406260,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Come in.
75404,L406255,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Let me have it.
75405,L406254,u2246,m144,ORDERLY,A message from Citizen Fouche.
75406,L406253,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Come in.
75407,L406247,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Send him in.
75408,L406246,u2246,m144,ORDERLY,"Major Lavallette to see you, General."
75409,L406245,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Come in.
75410,L406005,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Show him in.
75411,L406004,u2246,m144,ORDERLY,"Yes, sir."
75412,L406003,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,Is he alone?
75413,L406002,u2246,m144,ORDERLY,Eugene de Beauharnais.
75414,L406001,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,What did you say his name was?
75415,L406589,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us."
75416,L406588,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,"On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him."
75417,L406506,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,"With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer."
75418,L406505,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland."
75419,L406362,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day."
75420,L406361,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,"Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms."
75421,L406281,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much."
75422,L406280,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,"On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  ""I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."""
75423,L406062,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky."
75424,L406061,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,"Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him."
75425,L405873,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together."
75426,L405872,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,"He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline."
75427,L405871,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,"Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight."
75428,L405870,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,His moods at this time were complex and varied.
75429,L405854,u2244,m144,NAPOLEON,My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
75430,L405853,u2245,m144,NARRATOR,"Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena."

75432,L412178,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,And I can go free?
75433,L412177,u2252,m145,BABY'D,Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.

75437,L412173,u2252,m145,BABY'D,"Okay, I know what I want this time."
75438,L412502,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,Don't move me.
75439,L412501,u2253,m145,CRAIG,Stretch it out.
75440,L412471,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing."
75441,L412470,u2253,m145,CRAIG,That's a nice piece of heat right there.
75442,L412453,u2253,m145,CRAIG,Yup.
75443,L412452,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Me, too.  You think they're in there?"
75444,L412442,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help."
75445,L412441,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,No.  Thought he was with you.
75446,L412041,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby."
75447,L412040,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember."
75448,L412036,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,Suga!
75449,L412035,u2253,m145,CRAIG,I don't know!

75454,L411965,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,Good.
75455,L411964,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either."
75456,L411963,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though."
75457,L411962,u2253,m145,CRAIG,Y'all never use it?
75458,L411961,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
75459,L411960,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"It's cool, but where's the water?"
75460,L411959,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
75461,L411958,u2253,m145,CRAIG,You paid cash?
75462,L411957,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house."
75463,L411937,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?"
75464,L411936,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Well, let me in."
75465,L411935,u2253,m145,CRAIG,Yeah.
75466,L411934,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?"
75467,L411886,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"Thanks, Unc."

75469,L411880,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?"
75470,L411879,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"Alright, I'll remember that."
75471,L411878,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson."
75472,L411877,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"Naw, it ain't like that."
75473,L411876,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?"
75474,L412154,u2255,m145,D'WANA,Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.

75477,L412142,u2253,m145,CRAIG,I don't know... I think he went out the back.
75478,L412141,u2255,m145,D'WANA,Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
75479,L412139,u2255,m145,D'WANA,No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
75480,L412138,u2253,m145,CRAIG,Yes you did.
75481,L412137,u2255,m145,D'WANA,We didn't come here for Day-Day.

75485,L412323,u2265,m145,ROACH,"Fuck, what's his name?"
75486,L412322,u2253,m145,CRAIG,Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
75487,L412321,u2265,m145,ROACH,"Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along."
75488,L412311,u2265,m145,ROACH,What about the dog?
75489,L412310,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"It's about to work, just come on."

75554,L412231,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,Out the door and to the left.

75589,L411997,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.

75593,L411991,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,You don't know Baby D.
75594,L411990,u2253,m145,CRAIG,You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
75595,L411989,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,"That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too."
75596,L411988,u2253,m145,CRAIG,"Damn, you got a stalker."
75597,L411987,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
75598,L411986,u2253,m145,CRAIG,Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
75599,L411985,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,"Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing."

75793,L412109,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.

75812,L412481,u2256,m145,DAY-DAY,"Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations."
75813,L412480,u2260,m145,JOKER,Tape his mouth shut.
75814,L412469,u2260,m145,JOKER,Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?

75828,L412486,u2259,m145,EZAL,Huh?

75836,L412079,u2259,m145,EZAL,You too big.

75838,L412076,u2257,m145,DEBO,William.
75839,L412073,u2259,m145,EZAL,I don't know the number.
75840,L412072,u2257,m145,DEBO,Just do it.
75841,L412071,u2259,m145,EZAL,That ain't gonna work.
75842,L412070,u2257,m145,DEBO,"If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call."
75843,L412069,u2259,m145,EZAL,What urgent message?
75844,L412068,u2257,m145,DEBO,Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
75845,L411976,u2257,m145,DEBO,Get on!
75846,L411975,u2259,m145,EZAL,"Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that."
75847,L411974,u2257,m145,DEBO,Get on.
75848,L411973,u2259,m145,EZAL,Yeah.
75849,L411972,u2257,m145,DEBO,Rancho Cucamonga?
75850,L411971,u2259,m145,EZAL,He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
75851,L411970,u2257,m145,DEBO,What you say?
75852,L411969,u2259,m145,EZAL,"I don't know, Debo."
75853,L411968,u2257,m145,DEBO,Where did Craig move to?
75854,L412435,u2260,m145,JOKER,"Yeah, and hurry up."
75855,L412434,u2261,m145,KARLA,'Take your car?'
75856,L412433,u2260,m145,JOKER,Take your car.
75857,L412432,u2261,m145,KARLA,Are you going to take me to see Mom?
75858,L412431,u2260,m145,JOKER,Nothing.  What you want?
75859,L412430,u2261,m145,KARLA,"Hey, what's going on?"
75860,L412304,u2260,m145,JOKER,Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
75861,L412303,u2261,m145,KARLA,When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
75862,L412302,u2260,m145,JOKER,I'll take you later.
75863,L412301,u2261,m145,KARLA,I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
75864,L412568,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime."
75865,L412567,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,"Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff."
75866,L412500,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn."
75867,L412499,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,What's the matter?
75868,L412498,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,My back.
75869,L412495,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,"The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy."
75870,L412494,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa."
75871,L412478,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,Shut yo' ass up.
75872,L412477,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,Need to lose some weight.
75873,L412475,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,I got my mase.
75874,L412474,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,What about that ugly dog?
75875,L412458,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,"Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills."
75876,L412457,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes."
75877,L412456,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
75878,L412413,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them."
75879,L412412,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
75880,L412411,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!"
75881,L412410,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
75882,L412409,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!"
75883,L412408,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,I got your message.  Where's Craig?
75884,L411882,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?"
75885,L411881,u2263,m145,MR. JONES,"Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy."
75886,L412531,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
75887,L412530,u2266,m145,SUGA,"Come on, baby, let's go in the house."
75888,L412529,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight."
75889,L412528,u2266,m145,SUGA,"Aw, no lovin' tonight?"
75890,L412527,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"I threw my back, again."
75891,L412526,u2266,m145,SUGA,"Elroy, what happen?"
75892,L412044,u2266,m145,SUGA,"Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here."
75893,L412043,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl."
75894,L412042,u2266,m145,SUGA,Mr. Nasty time?
75895,L412039,u2266,m145,SUGA,"Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?"
75896,L412038,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,What you doing to my nephew?
75897,L412037,u2266,m145,SUGA,Huh?
75898,L411932,u2266,m145,SUGA,"Okay.  Bye, Craig."
75899,L411931,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
75900,L411930,u2266,m145,SUGA,Elroy.
75901,L411929,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes."
75902,L411926,u2266,m145,SUGA,"Oooh, ba-by!"
75903,L411925,u2267,m145,UNCLE ELROY,"Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig."
75904,L413247,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,I've been a bad boy.
75905,L413246,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,You sent my assistant on an errand.
75906,L413245,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,"Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand."
75907,L413244,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
75908,L413243,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,That's my girl.
75909,L413242,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,"All right, I'll do it."
75910,L413241,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,"Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog."
75911,L413240,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,"Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies."
75912,L413238,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Nothing. I broke a lamp.
75913,L413237,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,What happened here?
75914,L413236,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Don't remind me.
75915,L413233,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,"Who, him? Just visiting."
75916,L413232,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,What's he doing here?
75917,L413231,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
75918,L413226,u2268,m146,BRENDAN GRANT,It's an important speech.
75919,L413225,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
75920,L412740,u2269,m146,CABBIE,"Oh, yeah?"
75921,L412739,u2271,m146,GENE,Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
75922,L412737,u2269,m146,CABBIE,The grave. Somebody close?
75923,L412736,u2271,m146,GENE,What?
75924,L412735,u2269,m146,CABBIE,Somebody close?
75925,L412734,u2269,m146,CABBIE,"Aw, too bad."
75926,L412733,u2271,m146,GENE,I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
75927,L412732,u2269,m146,CABBIE,Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
75928,L412731,u2271,m146,GENE,Huh?
75929,L412730,u2269,m146,CABBIE,'S okay. What do you think?
75930,L412729,u2271,m146,GENE,Sorry.
75931,L412728,u2269,m146,CABBIE,"Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money."
75932,L412727,u2271,m146,GENE,San Diego.
75933,L412726,u2269,m146,CABBIE,Where'd you come from?
75934,L412725,u2271,m146,GENE,Business.
75935,L412724,u2269,m146,CABBIE,Business or pleasure?
75936,L412723,u2271,m146,GENE,"Uh, yes.."
75937,L412722,u2269,m146,CABBIE,You just come in on Amtrack?
75938,L412721,u2271,m146,GENE,What?
75939,L412720,u2269,m146,CABBIE,Amtrack?
75940,L412719,u2271,m146,GENE,The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
75941,L412718,u2269,m146,CABBIE,"Where to, sir?"
75942,L413322,u2271,m146,GENE,Same to you.
75943,L413321,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Good luck.
75944,L413320,u2271,m146,GENE,"No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?"
75945,L413319,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
75946,L413318,u2271,m146,GENE,Can we go now?
75947,L413313,u2271,m146,GENE,"Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello."
75948,L413312,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,For not believing you.
75949,L413311,u2271,m146,GENE,For what?
75950,L413310,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,I would also like to apologize.
75951,L413309,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,"I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene."
75952,L413202,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Indeed.
75953,L413201,u2271,m146,GENE,This? I've never even fired one.
75954,L413200,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
75955,L413199,u2271,m146,GENE,"It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them."
75956,L413198,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
75957,L413197,u2271,m146,GENE,There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
75958,L413195,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,"I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?"
75959,L413194,u2271,m146,GENE,I knew you wouldn't believe me.
75960,L413190,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,What the hell are you saying?
75961,L413189,u2271,m146,GENE,And your husband works for somebody else.
75962,L413188,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,What?
75963,L413187,u2271,m146,GENE,I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
75964,L413186,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Who did?
75965,L413185,u2271,m146,GENE,No.
75966,L413184,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,You shot her?
75967,L413183,u2271,m146,GENE,I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
75968,L413182,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,How do you know that?
75969,L413178,u2271,m146,GENE,It was because I had this...in my pocket
75970,L413177,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,You were very nervous.
75971,L413176,u2271,m146,GENE,That's right.
75972,L413175,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,I remember you...in the elevator.
75973,L413174,u2271,m146,GENE,"Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant."
75974,L413173,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Ah.
75975,L413172,u2271,m146,GENE,I have a problem.
75976,L413171,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,That's...a comfort to hear.
75977,L413170,u2271,m146,GENE,If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
75978,L413169,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
75979,L413168,u2271,m146,GENE,I appreciate that.
75980,L413167,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,My security people are right next door.
75981,L413166,u2271,m146,GENE,"Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you."
75982,L412790,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
75983,L412789,u2271,m146,GENE,She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
75984,L412788,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,Yes?
75985,L412787,u2271,m146,GENE,I...
75986,L412786,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,You were saying?  Your daughter....?
75987,L412781,u2271,m146,GENE,Its'...ah...about my daughter....
75988,L412780,u2270,m146,ELEANOR GRANT,What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
75989,L412779,u2271,m146,GENE,I need your help.
75990,L413060,u2271,m146,GENE,What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
75991,L413059,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,You know what I'm gonna do.
75992,L413058,u2271,m146,GENE,"What are you going to do about it, shoot me?"
75993,L413057,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Don't you threaten me.
75994,L413056,u2271,m146,GENE,I talk to her or you can forget about it.
75995,L413055,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Forget about it.
75996,L413054,u2271,m146,GENE,I want'to talk to her.
75997,L413053,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,No.
75998,L413052,u2271,m146,GENE,Let me talk to her again.
75999,L413051,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
76000,L413050,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,That's right. That gives you...
76001,L413049,u2271,m146,GENE,One thirty. California Ballroom.
76002,L413023,u2271,m146,GENE,"No, please..."
76003,L413022,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Again.
76004,L413008,u2271,m146,GENE,How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
76005,L413007,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Come back.
76006,L413006,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"That's not my problem, Mr. Watson"
76007,L413005,u2271,m146,GENE,How am I supposed to get away?
76008,L413004,u2271,m146,GENE,"Even if you don't, Her Security men will."
76009,L413003,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Keep your voice down.
76010,L413002,u2271,m146,GENE,I kill her - and you kill me.
76011,L413001,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"Do you now, Mr. Watson?"
76012,L413000,u2271,m146,GENE,"I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work."
76013,L412982,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,You fucked up.
76014,L412981,u2271,m146,GENE,I killed you.
76015,L412886,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved."
76016,L412885,u2271,m146,GENE,You killed him.
76017,L412884,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Tell me why he's dead.
76018,L412883,u2271,m146,GENE,How should I...?
76019,L412882,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
76020,L412881,u2271,m146,GENE,He's dead?
76021,L412880,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Tell me why I miss him.
76022,L412879,u2271,m146,GENE,What...?
76023,L412864,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Me?
76024,L412863,u2271,m146,GENE,What would you do in my place?
76025,L412843,u2271,m146,GENE,Then I have time for a drink.
76026,L412842,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,You get another chance in ten minutes.
76027,L412805,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,You...
76028,L412804,u2271,m146,GENE,It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
76029,L412803,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,What about the gun?
76030,L412802,u2271,m146,GENE,The gun...
76031,L412801,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Are you 'fucking with me!?
76032,L412767,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
76033,L412766,u2271,m146,GENE,Where did you get these? Who are you?
76034,L412765,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
76035,L412764,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
76036,L412763,u2271,m146,GENE,"This says ""invitation only""."
76037,L412716,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
76038,L412715,u2271,m146,GENE,At one thirty my little girl is dead.
76039,L412714,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
76040,L412682,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"Yes, you will, Mr. Watson."
76041,L412681,u2271,m146,GENE,I will do no such thing.
76042,L412680,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,What's your point?
76043,L412679,u2271,m146,GENE,You're out of your mind.
76044,L412676,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
76045,L412675,u2271,m146,GENE,"Yes, I'm listening."
76046,L412674,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?"
76047,L412673,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Good.
76048,L412672,u2271,m146,GENE,"Yes, yes, I understand."
76049,L412668,u2271,m146,GENE,You wouldn't...
76050,L412667,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt."
76051,L412654,u2271,m146,GENE,"Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends."
76052,L412653,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Daddy?
76053,L412644,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Don't worry. She's good with kids.
76054,L412643,u2271,m146,GENE,Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
76055,L412639,u2271,m146,GENE,I'd like to know what...
76056,L412638,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"Come with us, sir."
76057,L412635,u2271,m146,GENE,Yes.
76058,L412634,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?"
76059,L412633,u2271,m146,GENE,"Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near..."
76060,L412629,u2271,m146,GENE,What?
76061,L412628,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"Could I see some identification, sir?"
76062,L412947,u2273,m146,KRISTA,"I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor."
76063,L412946,u2271,m146,GENE,We have to hurry.
76064,L412943,u2273,m146,KRISTA,I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
76065,L412942,u2271,m146,GENE,Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
76066,L412933,u2273,m146,KRISTA,I think you're right.
76067,L412932,u2271,m146,GENE,I think you better put that away.
76068,L412930,u2271,m146,GENE,Okay...
76069,L412929,u2273,m146,KRISTA,Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
76070,L412928,u2271,m146,GENE,But...
76071,L412927,u2273,m146,KRISTA,I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
76072,L412926,u2271,m146,GENE,Are you sure?
76073,L412922,u2273,m146,KRISTA,He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
76074,L412921,u2271,m146,GENE,The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
76075,L412917,u2273,m146,KRISTA,It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
76076,L412916,u2271,m146,GENE,"You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me."
76077,L412915,u2273,m146,KRISTA,I don't know.
76078,L412912,u2273,m146,KRISTA,I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
76079,L412911,u2271,m146,GENE,No! You can't! They're in on it.
76080,L412910,u2273,m146,KRISTA,"All right, let's just...let's get security in on this."
76081,L412904,u2271,m146,GENE,Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
76082,L412903,u2273,m146,KRISTA,"Yes, you're right, I don't understand."
76083,L412902,u2271,m146,GENE,You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
76084,L412901,u2273,m146,KRISTA,"Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant."
76085,L412900,u2271,m146,GENE,My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
76086,L412794,u2271,m146,GENE,"No, that's,..that's fine"
76087,L412793,u2273,m146,KRISTA,Is that something precious?
76088,L413083,u2274,m146,LYNN,"No, kisses to..."
76089,L413082,u2271,m146,GENE,No. Kisses to you.
76090,L413081,u2274,m146,LYNN,No...kisses to you.
76091,L413080,u2271,m146,GENE,All right. Kisses to you.
76092,L413079,u2274,m146,LYNN,I promise.
76093,L413078,u2271,m146,GENE,Will you promise me that?
76094,L413076,u2271,m146,GENE,"He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you."
76095,L413075,u2274,m146,LYNN,All right.
76096,L413074,u2271,m146,GENE,"No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?"
76097,L413073,u2274,m146,LYNN,To be a hero?
76098,L413072,u2271,m146,GENE,"Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do."
76099,L413071,u2274,m146,LYNN,Can we go now?
76100,L413070,u2271,m146,GENE,"I know you do, honey."
76101,L413069,u2274,m146,LYNN,I'm tired. I want to.go now.
76102,L413068,u2271,m146,GENE,"Yes, sweetie, it's me."
76103,L412713,u2271,m146,GENE,Over and out.
76104,L412712,u2274,m146,LYNN,"He has to say ""over and out"". Daddy, you have to say ""over and out""."
76105,L412709,u2271,m146,GENE,"Yes. Yes, I can hear you."
76106,L412708,u2274,m146,LYNN,I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
76107,L412707,u2271,m146,GENE,Lynn!
76108,L412625,u2274,m146,LYNN,Right.
76109,L412624,u2271,m146,GENE,"Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?"
76110,L412622,u2271,m146,GENE,Let' s do it.
76111,L412621,u2274,m146,LYNN,Nods.
76112,L412620,u2271,m146,GENE,Ready?
76113,L412609,u2271,m146,GENE,How did you see us kiss?
76114,L412608,u2274,m146,LYNN,No way.
76115,L412607,u2271,m146,GENE,"So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?"
76116,L412605,u2271,m146,GENE,You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
76117,L412604,u2274,m146,LYNN,On TV.
76118,L412603,u2271,m146,GENE,Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
76119,L412589,u2271,m146,GENE,We made it.
76120,L412588,u2274,m146,LYNN,Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
76121,L412587,u2271,m146,GENE,"I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?"
76122,L413324,u2272,m146,HUEY,Thanks for the tip.
76123,L413323,u2271,m146,GENE,Thanks for the shine.
76124,L413211,u2271,m146,GENE,This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
76125,L413210,u2272,m146,HUEY,What are you going to do!?
76126,L413208,u2272,m146,HUEY,What are you going to do now?
76127,L413207,u2271,m146,GENE,I don't know.
76128,L413206,u2272,m146,HUEY,Well?
76129,L413161,u2272,m146,HUEY,It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
76130,L413160,u2271,m146,GENE,What am I supposed to say to her?
76131,L413157,u2271,m146,GENE,What!?
76132,L413156,u2272,m146,HUEY,You're going to go see her.
76133,L413155,u2271,m146,GENE,Yeah.
76134,L413154,u2272,m146,HUEY,You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
76135,L413152,u2271,m146,GENE,Thank you.
76136,L413151,u2272,m146,HUEY,Irene is going to help.
76137,L413150,u2271,m146,GENE,Hi.
76138,L413149,u2272,m146,HUEY,Meet Irene.
76139,L413122,u2272,m146,HUEY,Don't think I won't.
76140,L413121,u2271,m146,GENE,Keep the change.
76141,L413118,u2271,m146,GENE,What are you going to do?
76142,L413117,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you."
76143,L413116,u2271,m146,GENE,I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
76144,L413115,u2272,m146,HUEY,Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
76145,L413114,u2271,m146,GENE,So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
76146,L413113,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Yeah, all right, listen..."
76147,L413112,u2271,m146,GENE,"It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do."
76148,L413111,u2271,m146,GENE,It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
76149,L413110,u2272,m146,HUEY,Then why'd you drag me into it?
76150,L413109,u2271,m146,GENE,"No way, there's nothing you can do to help me."
76151,L413108,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Oh, Jesus ..."
76152,L413107,u2271,m146,GENE,The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
76153,L413106,u2272,m146,HUEY,Who?
76154,L413105,u2271,m146,GENE,One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
76155,L413104,u2272,m146,HUEY,I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
76156,L413103,u2271,m146,GENE,Kill the Governor.
76157,L413102,u2272,m146,HUEY,What are you supposed to do?
76158,L413101,u2271,m146,GENE,There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
76159,L413100,u2272,m146,HUEY,In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
76160,L413099,u2271,m146,GENE,My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
76161,L413097,u2272,m146,HUEY,Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
76162,L413096,u2271,m146,GENE,That's right.
76163,L413095,u2272,m146,HUEY,"This gorilla's watching you, is that right?"
76164,L413094,u2271,m146,GENE,What?
76165,L413093,u2272,m146,HUEY,Cover your mouth.
76166,L413092,u2271,m146,GENE,I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
76167,L413091,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Mister, what are you dragging me into?"
76168,L413040,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?"
76169,L413039,u2271,m146,GENE,Please...
76170,L413038,u2272,m146,HUEY,"What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair."
76171,L413037,u2271,m146,GENE,Please. Something is going to happen...
76172,L413036,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Oh, man..."
76173,L413035,u2271,m146,GENE,Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
76174,L413034,u2272,m146,HUEY,I remember. The big tipper.
76175,L413033,u2271,m146,GENE,You remember me?
76176,L412840,u2272,m146,HUEY,Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
76177,L412839,u2271,m146,GENE,Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
76178,L412837,u2271,m146,GENE,Keep it.
76179,L412836,u2272,m146,HUEY,It's a twenty.
76180,L412835,u2271,m146,GENE,Keep it.
76181,L412834,u2272,m146,HUEY,You got anything smaller?
76182,L412831,u2271,m146,GENE,Is within himself.
76183,L412830,u2272,m146,HUEY,I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
76184,L412829,u2271,m146,GENE,I said I have to do something.
76185,L412828,u2272,m146,HUEY,What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
76186,L412827,u2271,m146,GENE,I have to do something.
76187,L412822,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?"
76188,L412821,u2271,m146,GENE,I'm just an accountant.
76189,L412820,u2272,m146,HUEY,"What do you do, if I may be so bold?"
76190,L413300,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,Fuck you!
76191,L413299,u2272,m146,HUEY,Gimme a dollar.

76193,L413297,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
76194,L413296,u2272,m146,HUEY,"Oh, we'll have to do better than that."
76195,L413294,u2272,m146,HUEY,I think this is worth a dollar.
76196,L413293,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,Hey!
76197,L413292,u2272,m146,HUEY,I don't think so.
76198,L413291,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,Fuckin' A.
76199,L413290,u2272,m146,HUEY,You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
76200,L413289,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,I don't have to pay you nothin'.
76201,L413288,u2272,m146,HUEY,It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
76202,L413287,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!"
76203,L413286,u2272,m146,HUEY,Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
76204,L413285,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here."
76205,L413284,u2272,m146,HUEY,You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
76206,L413283,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,I don't want my windshield cleaned.
76207,L413282,u2272,m146,HUEY,Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
76208,L412967,u2277,m146,MYSTERY MAN,Could I see it?
76209,L412966,u2273,m146,KRISTA,It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
76210,L412965,u2277,m146,MYSTERY MAN,"Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?"
76211,L412963,u2277,m146,MYSTERY MAN,I see. Where is this gun?
76212,L412962,u2273,m146,KRISTA,He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a

76214,L412960,u2273,m146,KRISTA,He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
76215,L413279,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
76216,L413278,u2274,m146,LYNN,A surprise?
76217,L413277,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,I've got something for you.

76220,L413274,u2274,m146,LYNN,I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
76221,L413273,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"You're a big girl, huh?"
76222,L413272,u2274,m146,LYNN,I'm not a baby.
76223,L413218,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all."

76226,L412810,u2274,m146,LYNN,"Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home."
76227,L412809,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"You have, huh?"
76228,L412808,u2274,m146,LYNN,I've done much better ones than this.
76229,L412807,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,That's pretty good.
76230,L412696,u2274,m146,LYNN,My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
76231,L412695,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
76232,L412660,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,It goes in that little hole.
76233,L412659,u2274,m146,LYNN,Laughs.
76234,L412658,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!"

76238,L412646,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference."
76239,L412645,u2274,m146,LYNN,You stole that.
76240,L413216,u2278,m146,OFFICER TRUST,It's time. It's time now.

76249,L412870,u2278,m146,OFFICER TRUST,It doesn't look like it.
76250,L412869,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Yeah.
76251,L412868,u2278,m146,OFFICER TRUST,You got this under control?

76262,L412704,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it."
76263,L412693,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,You're wasting time.
76264,L412692,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,Only you.
76265,L412691,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,"God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her."
76266,L412686,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,I kill her anyway.
76267,L412685,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,And what happens if I don't call you?

76278,L412592,u2275,m146,MR. SMITH,Keep your eyes peeled.
76279,L412591,u2276,m146,MS. JONES,"Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em."

76285,L413418,u2285,m147,GUARD,He never told about the money.
76286,L413417,u2279,m147,BART,He carried on some; kicked.
76287,L413416,u2285,m147,GUARD,"He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke."
76288,L413415,u2279,m147,BART,No.
76289,L413414,u2285,m147,GUARD,Any trouble?
76290,L413411,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,"Keep talkin', Preacher."
76291,L413410,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you."
76292,L413409,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,"Keep talkin', Preacher."
76293,L413408,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Salvation is a last-minute business, boy."

76297,L413404,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper."
76298,L413403,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,"You, Preacher?"
76299,L413402,u2289,m147,PREACHER,I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
76300,L413401,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,"How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?"
76301,L413400,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!"
76302,L413399,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,"Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?"
76303,L413398,u2289,m147,PREACHER,With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
76304,L413397,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,"That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want."
76305,L413396,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"You killed two men, Ben Harper."
76306,L413395,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,Hm!
76307,L413394,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, ""And a little child shall lead them."""
76308,L413393,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
76309,L413392,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"No, Ben."
76310,L413391,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!

76312,L413372,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,And I won't never tell about the money.

76321,L413363,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,Here they come.
76322,L413358,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,Listen to me John.
76323,L413357,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,"Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --"
76324,L413356,u2280,m147,BEN HARPER,Where's your Mom?
76325,L413899,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!

76331,L413657,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,No.
76332,L413656,u2281,m147,BIRDIE STEPTOE,"Do you mind me cussin', boy?"
76333,L413655,u2281,m147,BIRDIE STEPTOE,"Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale."
76334,L413654,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,"Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?"
76335,L413653,u2281,m147,BIRDIE STEPTOE,There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
76336,L413652,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,"Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie."
76337,L413553,u2281,m147,BIRDIE STEPTOE,"Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time."
76338,L413552,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,"Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie."

76343,L413547,u2281,m147,BIRDIE STEPTOE,And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
76344,L413546,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,When'll the skiff be ready?

76422,L413477,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
76423,L413690,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,It's a shame!
76424,L413689,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!

76434,L413510,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,What he needs is a dose o' salts!
76435,L413509,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad."

76449,L413785,u2289,m147,PREACHER,I tried to save her.
76450,L413784,u2289,m147,PREACHER,She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
76451,L413783,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,What!
76452,L413782,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong..."
76453,L413781,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,How?
76454,L413780,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night."
76455,L413774,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends."
76456,L413773,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,Amen.
76457,L413772,u2289,m147,PREACHER,I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.

76462,L413751,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!"
76463,L413750,u2289,m147,PREACHER,She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
76464,L413749,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,Amen! Amen!
76465,L413497,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
76466,L413496,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"My, that fudge smells yummy!"
76467,L413489,u2286,m147,ICEY SPOON,You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
76468,L413488,u2289,m147,PREACHER,I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.

76528,L414021,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"Well, shoot! Maybe there was!"
76529,L414020,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,I mind you said there was two.
76530,L414019,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"Kings! Why, honey, there was only one."
76531,L414018,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
76532,L414017,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"Story, honey? Why, what story?"
76533,L414015,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
76534,L414014,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Up river.
76535,L414013,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,Where ye from?
76536,L414012,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,Dead.
76537,L414011,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Dead.
76538,L414010,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"John, where's your folks?"
76539,L413968,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,She talks to herself.
76540,L413967,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!"
76541,L413951,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
76542,L413950,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Don't you hurt her!
76543,L414096,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Come to me, boy!"
76544,L414095,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Nothin'.
76545,L413886,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"You could save him, little bird."
76546,L413885,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,"Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!"
76547,L413879,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Under the stone in the floor.
76548,L413878,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Now: Where?
76549,L413876,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Yonder.
76550,L413875,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars."
76551,L413874,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Why sure, boy, sure."
76552,L413873,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Don't you believe me?
76553,L413872,u2289,m147,PREACHER,You don't reckon I'd leave you.
76554,L413871,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
76555,L413870,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,What?
76556,L413869,u2289,m147,PREACHER,All right...  Come along.
76557,L413866,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
76558,L413865,u2289,m147,PREACHER,All right boy: where's the money?
76559,L413863,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,"NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell."
76560,L413862,u2289,m147,PREACHER,I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
76561,L413861,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,I'll tell.
76562,L413860,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Now! Where's it hid, honey?"
76563,L413667,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?"
76564,L413666,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,I don't know nothin'!
76565,L413665,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?"
76566,L413643,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy."
76567,L413642,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Yes. Yes.
76568,L413641,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid."
76569,L413637,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Come on, children!"
76570,L413636,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
76571,L413635,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"What's that you're playing with, boy?"
76572,L413634,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,It -- she --
76573,L413633,u2289,m147,PREACHER,What's taking you so long about it?
76574,L413632,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Getting Pearl to bed. I --
76575,L413631,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"What are you doing, boy?"
76576,L413569,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,No. No.
76577,L413568,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?"
76578,L413567,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Nothin'!
76579,L413566,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Tell me what, boy?"
76580,L413565,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
76581,L413564,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!"
76582,L413563,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
76583,L413562,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --"
76584,L413561,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Huh?
76585,L413560,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Did you hear what I said, son?"
76586,L413494,u2287,m147,JOHN HARPER,Is that all?
76587,L413493,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was."
76588,L413857,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!"
76589,L413856,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
76590,L413855,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
76591,L413847,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Because John said I mustn't.
76592,L413846,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Why, pray tell?"
76593,L413845,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,No.
76594,L413844,u2289,m147,PREACHER,About our secrets.
76595,L413843,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
76596,L413842,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Can I have milk too?
76597,L413841,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Naturally.
76598,L413840,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Can I have my supper please?
76599,L413839,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!"
76600,L413838,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,I'm hungry.
76601,L413704,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!"
76602,L413703,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,John's bad.
76603,L413702,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Where's the money hid.
76604,L413701,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,All right.
76605,L413700,u2289,m147,PREACHER,O no! Your turn!
76606,L413699,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Tell me another secret about my Dad.
76607,L413698,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Yes; John's bad.
76608,L413685,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
76609,L413684,u2289,m147,PREACHER,You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
76610,L413681,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
76611,L413680,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
76612,L413679,u2289,m147,PREACHER,What's your name?
76613,L413678,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Sure, that's no secret."
76614,L413677,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,That's no secret. I'm five.
76615,L413676,u2289,m147,PREACHER,How old are you?
76616,L413675,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,What secret shall I tell?
76617,L413674,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Now it's your turn.
76618,L413673,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Yes?
76619,L413672,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, ""Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."""
76620,L413671,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Yes?
76621,L413670,u2289,m147,PREACHER,I'll tell you a secret.
76622,L413669,u2288,m147,PEARL HARPER,Mm-hm.
76623,L413668,u2289,m147,PREACHER,John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
76624,L414040,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Ahh!
76625,L414039,u2291,m147,RUBY,Only she won't never let me play with it.
76626,L414038,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
76627,L414037,u2291,m147,RUBY,Pearl and John.
76628,L414036,u2289,m147,PREACHER,What's their names?
76629,L414035,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?"
76630,L414034,u2291,m147,RUBY,No. No one never did.
76631,L414033,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?"
76632,L414029,u2289,m147,PREACHER,O' course.
76633,L414028,u2291,m147,RUBY,Will you buy me a choclit sody?
76634,L414027,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear."
76635,L414026,u2291,m147,RUBY,Can I have this?
76636,L414025,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?"
76637,L413777,u2292,m147,WALT,Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
76638,L413776,u2289,m147,PREACHER,She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
76639,L413775,u2292,m147,WALT,She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
76640,L413771,u2289,m147,PREACHER,A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
76641,L413770,u2292,m147,WALT,Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
76642,L413769,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon."
76643,L413768,u2292,m147,WALT,"That's mighty brave of you, Reverend."
76644,L413766,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
76645,L413765,u2292,m147,WALT,What do you figure to do?
76646,L413763,u2289,m147,PREACHER,She turned me out of the bed.
76647,L413762,u2292,m147,WALT,How's that?
76648,L413761,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Our honeymoon.
76649,L413760,u2292,m147,WALT,The first night?
76650,L413759,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Yes; from the first night.
76651,L413758,u2292,m147,WALT,Didn't you have no inkling?
76652,L413754,u2289,m147,PREACHER,It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
76653,L413753,u2292,m147,WALT,Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
76654,L413748,u2289,m147,PREACHER,A strange woman is a narrow pit!
76655,L413747,u2292,m147,WALT,Mister Powell?
76656,L413723,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
76657,L413722,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Answer me!
76658,L413721,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"It's not in the river, is it Harry?"
76659,L413720,u2289,m147,PREACHER,You were listening outside the parlor window.
76660,L413719,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"I'm through, Harry."
76661,L413718,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Are you through praying?
76662,L413602,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,Yes.
76663,L413601,u2289,m147,PREACHER,It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
76664,L413600,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"I -- no, I --"
76665,L413599,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Do you want more children, Willa?"
76666,L413592,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Get up.
76667,L413591,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"Harry, what --"
76668,L413590,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Get up, Willa."
76669,L413589,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven."
76670,L413588,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"No, Harry! I thought --"
76671,L413587,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?"
76672,L413586,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --"
76673,L413585,u2289,m147,PREACHER,I was praying.
76674,L413584,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,Harry!
76675,L413534,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money."
76676,L413533,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,"John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you."
76677,L413491,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins."
76678,L413490,u2293,m147,WILLA HARPER,John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
76679,L414134,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
76680,L414133,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"None of your business, Madam."
76681,L414132,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,What are you after them for?
76682,L414131,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Them kids!
76683,L414130,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,What do you want?
76684,L414098,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Didn't you hear me, boy?"
76685,L414097,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"What's wrong, John?"
76686,L414094,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"What's wrong, John?"
76687,L414093,u2289,m147,PREACHER,The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
76688,L414092,u2289,m147,PREACHER,The Lord will provide.
76689,L414091,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
76690,L414090,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!"
76691,L414087,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!"
76692,L414086,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
76693,L414085,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,She took them kids with her?
76694,L414084,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River."
76695,L414083,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,Where's she at?
76696,L414082,u2289,m147,PREACHER,She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
76697,L414081,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,Where's your Missus?
76698,L414080,u2289,m147,PREACHER,My flesh and blood!
76699,L414079,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,Them kids is yours?
76700,L414078,u2289,m147,PREACHER,It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
76701,L414077,u2289,m147,PREACHER,Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
76702,L414073,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,It's about that John and that Pearl?
76703,L414072,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"You're Miz Cooper, I take it."
76704,L414071,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,How'do.
76705,L414070,u2289,m147,PREACHER,"Mornin', ladies."
76706,L414069,u2291,m147,RUBY,The man! The man!
76707,L414068,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,What?

76709,L414064,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,John and Pearl!
76710,L414063,u2291,m147,RUBY,Pearl and John.
76711,L414062,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,What'd you all talk about?
76712,L414061,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something."
76713,L414060,u2291,m147,RUBY,He never asked me for nothin'.
76714,L414059,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,Now who was this?

76718,L414052,u2291,m147,RUBY,Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
76719,L414051,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,The Drugstore?
76720,L414050,u2291,m147,RUBY,This man down at the Drugstore...
76721,L414049,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,When did I ever?

76724,L414046,u2291,m147,RUBY,I been bad!
76725,L414005,u2290,m147,RACHEL COOPER,"Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?"
76726,L414004,u2291,m147,RUBY,Pearl and John!
76727,L414589,u2294,m148,DR KING,Get the kit!
76728,L414588,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Oh my god, oh my god..."
76729,L414578,u2294,m148,DR KING,R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
76730,L414577,u2297,m148,MARGE,How can you tell?
76731,L414575,u2294,m148,DR KING,"She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up."
76732,L414574,u2297,m148,MARGE,What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
76733,L414573,u2294,m148,DR KING,"Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died."
76734,L414572,u2297,m148,MARGE,"What the hell are dreams, anyway?"
76735,L414571,u2297,m148,MARGE,Thank God.
76736,L414570,u2294,m148,DR KING,"Okay, good. She's asleep."
76737,L414568,u2297,m148,MARGE,It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
76738,L414567,u2294,m148,DR KING,Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
76739,L414566,u2297,m148,MARGE,Since the murder. She was fine before that.
76740,L414565,u2294,m148,DR KING,How long's this been going on?
76741,L414563,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Please, Nancy. Trust us."
76742,L414562,u2294,m148,DR KING,"Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?"
76743,L414561,u2297,m148,MARGE,"They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here."
76744,L414557,u2297,m148,MARGE,I sure as hell hope so.
76745,L414556,u2294,m148,DR KING,"Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away."
76746,L414554,u2297,m148,MARGE,"No, nothing."
76747,L414553,u2294,m148,DR KING,Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
76748,L414692,u2299,m148,NANCY,Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
76749,L414691,u2295,m148,GLEN,Meanwhile...?
76750,L414690,u2299,m148,NANCY,You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
76751,L414689,u2295,m148,GLEN,You crazy? Hit him with what?
76752,L414688,u2299,m148,NANCY,"You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?"
76753,L414687,u2295,m148,GLEN,What!?
76754,L414686,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out."
76755,L414685,u2295,m148,GLEN,I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
76756,L414684,u2299,m148,NANCY,"If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts."
76757,L414683,u2295,m148,GLEN,"Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!"
76758,L414682,u2299,m148,NANCY,Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
76759,L414681,u2295,m148,GLEN,How you plan to do that?
76760,L414680,u2299,m148,NANCY,My dream.
76761,L414679,u2295,m148,GLEN,Bring him out of what?
76762,L414678,u2299,m148,NANCY,Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
76763,L414677,u2295,m148,GLEN,Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
76764,L414676,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next."
76765,L414675,u2295,m148,GLEN,You do?
76766,L414674,u2299,m148,NANCY,The killer.
76767,L414673,u2295,m148,GLEN,Who?
76768,L414672,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is."
76769,L414671,u2295,m148,GLEN,I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
76770,L414670,u2299,m148,NANCY,Much better.
76771,L414668,u2295,m148,GLEN,"Oh. Hi, how y'doing?"
76772,L414667,u2299,m148,NANCY,Hi.
76773,L414666,u2295,m148,GLEN,Hello?
76774,L414629,u2295,m148,GLEN,Well what you reading it for?
76775,L414628,u2299,m148,NANCY,I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
76776,L414627,u2295,m148,GLEN,'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
76777,L414626,u2299,m148,NANCY,Great.
76778,L414625,u2295,m148,GLEN,I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
76779,L414624,u2299,m148,NANCY,What happens if they don't do that?
76780,L414623,u2295,m148,GLEN,"They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears."
76781,L414622,u2299,m148,NANCY,And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
76782,L414621,u2295,m148,GLEN,"Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills."
76783,L414620,u2299,m148,NANCY,Yeah.
76784,L414619,u2295,m148,GLEN,"They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?"
76785,L414618,u2299,m148,NANCY,No.
76786,L414617,u2295,m148,GLEN,You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
76787,L414616,u2295,m148,GLEN,Used to. Not anymore.
76788,L414615,u2299,m148,NANCY,"And if you can't do that, you sleep."
76789,L414614,u2295,m148,GLEN,Whenever I get nervous I eat.
76790,L414486,u2299,m148,NANCY,Just checking -- keep out of sight!
76791,L414485,u2295,m148,GLEN,Yeah. So?
76792,L414483,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do..."
76793,L414482,u2295,m148,GLEN,"Jesus, it's dark in here."
76794,L414479,u2295,m148,GLEN,"Okay, okay.  I think."
76795,L414478,u2299,m148,NANCY,Okay?
76796,L414477,u2299,m148,NANCY,"It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?"
76797,L414476,u2295,m148,GLEN,Uh-oh...
76798,L414475,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask."
76799,L414474,u2295,m148,GLEN,"I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately."
76800,L414473,u2299,m148,NANCY,You believe in anything?
76801,L414472,u2295,m148,GLEN,"One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it."
76802,L414471,u2299,m148,NANCY,You believe in the Boogey Man?
76803,L414470,u2295,m148,GLEN,No.
76804,L414469,u2299,m148,NANCY,Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
76805,L414468,u2295,m148,GLEN,Slept like a rock.
76806,L414467,u2299,m148,NANCY,"M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?"
76807,L414464,u2299,m148,NANCY,Not really.
76808,L414463,u2295,m148,GLEN,"Haven't slept, have you?"
76809,L414462,u2299,m148,NANCY,Guess I did.
76810,L414459,u2295,m148,GLEN,Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
76811,L414458,u2299,m148,NANCY,Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
76812,L414323,u2299,m148,NANCY,Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
76813,L414322,u2295,m148,GLEN,You okay?
76814,L414319,u2299,m148,NANCY,Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
76815,L414318,u2295,m148,GLEN,What the hell's going on!?
76816,L414290,u2295,m148,GLEN,Who was scary?
76817,L414289,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Because he was scary, that's why."
76818,L414288,u2295,m148,GLEN,"Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?"
76819,L414287,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves."
76820,L414286,u2295,m148,GLEN,So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
76821,L414271,u2299,m148,NANCY,Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
76822,L414270,u2295,m148,GLEN,It's just a stupid cat.
76823,L414250,u2295,m148,GLEN,Jesus.
76824,L414249,u2299,m148,NANCY,Worked like a charm.
76825,L414809,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!"
76826,L414808,u2299,m148,NANCY,DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
76827,L414767,u2299,m148,NANCY,Deal.

76829,L414764,u2299,m148,NANCY,"And you'll be here to catch him, right?"
76830,L414763,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along."
76831,L414762,u2299,m148,NANCY,That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
76832,L414761,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"Sure, but..."
76833,L414760,u2299,m148,NANCY,-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
76834,L414758,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to."
76835,L414757,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby."
76836,L414756,u2299,m148,NANCY,Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
76837,L414755,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"Nan, I --"
76838,L414754,u2299,m148,NANCY,"I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please."
76839,L414752,u2299,m148,NANCY,"You know he's dead though, right?"
76840,L414751,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
76841,L414750,u2299,m148,NANCY,Hi daddy. I know what happened.
76842,L414749,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,Hello Nancy.
76843,L414522,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep."
76844,L414521,u2299,m148,NANCY,Dad -- what you doing here?
76845,L414414,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag."
76846,L414413,u2299,m148,NANCY,You don't know he did it.
76847,L414412,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,He's dangerous.
76848,L414411,u2299,m148,NANCY,Just want to talk to him a second.
76849,L414410,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill."
76850,L414409,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Dad, I want to see Rod Lane."
76851,L414408,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,Decide to take a day off after all?
76852,L414383,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,"What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!"
76853,L414382,u2299,m148,NANCY,"You used me, daddy!"
76854,L414352,u2299,m148,NANCY,"She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone."
76855,L414351,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,What?
76856,L414350,u2299,m148,NANCY,She dreamed this would happen...

76865,L414337,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,I don't mean her --
76866,L414336,u2300,m148,PARKER,She lived there.
76867,L414335,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
76868,L414334,u2300,m148,PARKER,"Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --"
76869,L414330,u2300,m148,PARKER,"Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene."
76870,L414329,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,What's the Coroner got to say?
76871,L414327,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
76872,L414326,u2300,m148,PARKER,"Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --"
76873,L414788,u2298,m148,MR LANTZ,Like Rod Lane?
76874,L414787,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
76875,L414786,u2298,m148,MR LANTZ,Maybe god's punishing us all...
76876,L414785,u2298,m148,MR LANTZ,"Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams."
76877,L414784,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,How you know that?
76878,L414783,u2298,m148,MR LANTZ,Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
76879,L414782,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,Krueger?
76880,L414781,u2298,m148,MR LANTZ,Krueger.
76881,L414780,u2296,m148,LT THOMPSON,Who? Who did that?
76882,L414828,u2297,m148,MARGE,"They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more."
76883,L414827,u2299,m148,NANCY,Feeling better?
76884,L414776,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you..."

76886,L414774,u2297,m148,MARGE,Guess I should'n'a done it.
76887,L414740,u2297,m148,MARGE,"I don't even have it on me, so forget it."
76888,L414739,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Give me the key, mother."
76889,L414664,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep."
76890,L414663,u2299,m148,NANCY,All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
76891,L414654,u2299,m148,NANCY,Go on...
76892,L414653,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side..."
76893,L414649,u2299,m148,NANCY,So he's alive?
76894,L414648,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that."
76895,L414645,u2299,m148,NANCY,I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
76896,L414644,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me."

76898,L414642,u2297,m148,MARGE,Dead and gone.
76899,L414641,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger."
76900,L414640,u2297,m148,MARGE,S'curity.
76901,L414639,u2299,m148,NANCY,What's with the bars?
76902,L414611,u2297,m148,MARGE,Nancy!
76903,L414610,u2299,m148,NANCY,Screw sleep!

76906,L414600,u2297,m148,MARGE,"But that's just not reality, Nancy!"
76907,L414599,u2299,m148,NANCY,"What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams."
76908,L414598,u2297,m148,MARGE,"I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --"
76909,L414597,u2299,m148,NANCY,Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
76910,L414596,u2297,m148,MARGE,I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!

76914,L414509,u2299,m148,NANCY,Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
76915,L414508,u2297,m148,MARGE,You okay?
76916,L414505,u2297,m148,MARGE,Nancy?

76927,L414442,u2299,m148,NANCY,Warm milk. Gross.
76928,L414441,u2297,m148,MARGE,"It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now."
76929,L414440,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Mother, for petesakes."

76934,L414434,u2299,m148,NANCY,I won't.
76935,L414433,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Nancy, don't fall asleep in there."
76936,L414366,u2299,m148,NANCY,Right home after. See you.
76937,L414365,u2297,m148,MARGE,Right home after.
76938,L414364,u2299,m148,NANCY,"I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?"
76939,L414363,u2297,m148,MARGE,Did you sleep?
76940,L414361,u2297,m148,MARGE,"I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school."
76941,L414360,u2299,m148,NANCY,School.
76942,L414359,u2297,m148,MARGE,Where you think you're going?
76943,L414348,u2297,m148,MARGE,Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
76944,L414347,u2299,m148,NANCY,It wasn't that serious...
76945,L414346,u2297,m148,MARGE,"Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina."
76946,L414432,u2299,m148,NANCY,No.
76947,L414431,u2301,m148,ROD,Do you think I did it?
76948,L414428,u2301,m148,ROD,"I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up..."
76949,L414427,u2299,m148,NANCY,What you mean 'all at once'?
76950,L414424,u2301,m148,ROD,Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
76951,L414423,u2299,m148,NANCY,Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
76952,L414422,u2301,m148,ROD,No.
76953,L414420,u2301,m148,ROD,How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
76954,L414419,u2299,m148,NANCY,How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
76955,L414418,u2301,m148,ROD,"I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her."
76956,L414417,u2299,m148,NANCY,And then what happened?
76957,L414375,u2299,m148,NANCY,The door was locked from your side.
76958,L414374,u2301,m148,ROD,Someone else was there.
76959,L414373,u2299,m148,NANCY,You were screaming like crazy.
76960,L414372,u2301,m148,ROD,I never touched her.
76961,L414371,u2299,m148,NANCY,Nobody's gonna kill you.
76962,L414370,u2301,m148,ROD,The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
76963,L414369,u2299,m148,NANCY,He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
76964,L414368,u2301,m148,ROD,"Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?"
76965,L414284,u2299,m148,NANCY,We should get her out of here...
76966,L414283,u2301,m148,ROD,We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
76967,L414260,u2299,m148,NANCY,"I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out..."
76968,L414259,u2302,m148,TINA,What you dream?
76969,L414254,u2302,m148,TINA,Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
76970,L414253,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous."
76971,L414252,u2302,m148,TINA,Really. Turn 'er up a little.
76972,L414251,u2299,m148,NANCY,Nice to have a fire.
76973,L414241,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Right. Well, she didn't, exactly..."
76974,L414240,u2302,m148,TINA,I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
76975,L414236,u2299,m148,NANCY,"Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy."
76976,L414235,u2302,m148,TINA,"Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?"
76977,L414234,u2302,m148,TINA,"Yeah, nuts."
76978,L414233,u2299,m148,NANCY,He's nuts about you.
76979,L414232,u2302,m148,TINA,Rod says the sweetest things.
76980,L414301,u2301,m148,ROD,"Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something."
76981,L414300,u2302,m148,TINA,When did you have a nightmare?
76982,L414299,u2301,m148,ROD,Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
76983,L414298,u2302,m148,TINA,No more fights.
76984,L414297,u2301,m148,ROD,No more fights?
76985,L414296,u2302,m148,TINA,Jungle man fix Jane.
76986,L414295,u2301,m148,ROD,"You feel better now, right?"
76987,L414277,u2302,m148,TINA,Of course. What's that?
76988,L414276,u2301,m148,ROD,"Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?"
76989,L414275,u2302,m148,TINA,What the hell you doing here?
76990,L420019,u2303,m149,ALL THREE RUSSIANS,"From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?"
76991,L420018,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,From Leon.
76992,L420015,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,It's from Paris.
76993,L420014,u2303,m149,ALL THREE RUSSIANS,"What is it, Ninotchka?"
76994,L419517,u2303,m149,ALL THREE RUSSIANS,"Naturally, Comrade."
76995,L419516,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Bring me forty-five back.
76996,L419515,u2303,m149,ALL THREE RUSSIANS,"Thank you, Comrade, thank you."
76997,L419514,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, here are fifty francs."
76998,L419513,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Have you any money?
76999,L419512,u2303,m149,ALL THREE RUSSIANS,"Thank you, Comrade."
77000,L419951,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
77001,L419950,u2304,m149,ANNA,Just for the honeymoon.
77002,L419949,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You want this?
77003,L419948,u2304,m149,ANNA,You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
77004,L419947,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"What is it, Anna?"
77005,L419946,u2304,m149,ANNA,"Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends."
77006,L419945,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You feel it, though."
77007,L419944,u2304,m149,ANNA,They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
77008,L419943,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze."
77009,L419942,u2304,m149,ANNA,And there?
77010,L419941,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm...."
77011,L419940,u2304,m149,ANNA,"Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating."
77012,L419939,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
77013,L419938,u2304,m149,ANNA,You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
77014,L419937,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock."
77015,L419936,u2304,m149,ANNA,What do you wear in the morning?
77016,L419935,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,A dress you wear in the evening.
77017,L419934,u2304,m149,ANNA,Evening gown?
77018,L419933,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,An evening gown.
77019,L419932,u2304,m149,ANNA,"As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me."
77020,L419931,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
77021,L419930,u2304,m149,ANNA,What was it like?
77022,L419929,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, a hat..."
77023,L419928,u2304,m149,ANNA,Tell me... what else did you have?
77024,L419927,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this."
77025,L419926,u2304,m149,ANNA,"Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?"
77026,L419925,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear."
77027,L419924,u2304,m149,ANNA,You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
77028,L419923,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I see.
77029,L419922,u2304,m149,ANNA,When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
77030,L419921,u2304,m149,ANNA,You should. I'll show you.
77031,L419920,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I have nothing to hide.
77032,L419919,u2304,m149,ANNA,That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
77033,L419918,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
77034,L419917,u2304,m149,ANNA,Ever since you have been back from Paris...
77035,L419916,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,About what?
77036,L419915,u2304,m149,ANNA,"And you too, Ninotchka."
77037,L419914,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You should be more careful, Anna."
77038,L419913,u2304,m149,ANNA,"I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police."
77039,L419912,u2304,m149,ANNA,It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
77040,L419911,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage."
77041,L419910,u2304,m149,ANNA,An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
77042,L419909,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,An omelet.
77043,L419908,u2304,m149,ANNA,What are you serving?
77044,L419907,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,A few friends... just a little dinner party.
77045,L419906,u2304,m149,ANNA,I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
77046,L419905,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna."
77047,L419904,u2304,m149,ANNA,"They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, ""There's sabotage in the string section!"""
77048,L419902,u2304,m149,ANNA,"No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade."
77049,L419901,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Aren't you late?
77050,L419900,u2304,m149,ANNA,"Good evening, Ninotchka."
77051,L419899,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Good evening, Anna."
77052,L420099,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Right now it's on the balcony.
77053,L420098,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
77054,L420070,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer."
77055,L420069,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka."
77056,L420010,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!"
77057,L420009,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
77058,L420006,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"...des raisins de Madre, des framboises..."
77059,L420005,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes..."
77060,L419994,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
77061,L419993,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
77062,L419992,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it."
77063,L419987,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,That's another thing... it's spring.
77064,L419986,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
77065,L419975,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka."
77066,L419974,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
77067,L419966,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,I can tell you exactly.
77068,L419965,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?"
77069,L419840,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,That's right.
77070,L419839,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower."
77071,L419397,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Or we can't go back to Russia!
77072,L419396,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Or it might be the firing squad!
77073,L419395,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!"
77074,L419372,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face."
77075,L419371,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
77076,L419370,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,That's her.
77077,L419096,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Positively not!
77078,L419095,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"No, that's not him..."
77079,L419068,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Possibly.
77080,L419067,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Are we free, Buljanoff?"
77081,L419061,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,...and little Lady Beatrice?
77082,L419060,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,And how is Lord Lavenham?
77083,L419045,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
77084,L419044,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,You wouldn't like Razinin.
77085,L418989,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes."
77086,L418988,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
77087,L418877,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,I don't want to go to Siberia.
77088,L418876,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
77089,L420072,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"No, that's bad management."
77090,L420071,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
77091,L419999,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
77092,L419998,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
77093,L419985,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Just see how happy the people look... from here....
77094,L419984,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
77095,L419977,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,How many families live here with you?
77096,L419976,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,What a lovely room you have here.
77097,L419964,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
77098,L419963,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Let's be happy that we're all alive.
77099,L419960,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,That's right... and we might as well face it.
77100,L419959,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
77101,L419400,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?"
77102,L419399,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Yes! We could stay with Leon!
77103,L419384,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,What do you mean they might -- they will!
77104,L419383,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,And they might believe her in Moscow.
77105,L419382,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
77106,L419135,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
77107,L419134,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,We had to take it on account of the safe.
77108,L419093,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Yes, he looks like a comrade!"
77109,L419092,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,That must be the one!
77110,L419080,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
77111,L419079,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,What is it?
77112,L419078,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Misha! Misha!
77113,L419047,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?"
77114,L419046,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,We don't like Razinin.
77115,L418987,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,But what can we do?... We have to accept.
77116,L418986,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,He's cutting our throat...
77117,L418979,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
77118,L418978,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Capitalistic methods...
77119,L418902,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
77120,L418901,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble."
77121,L418875,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?"
77122,L418874,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior."
77123,L418892,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Why should you be afraid?
77124,L418891,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high."
77125,L418890,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,May I ask how much your rooms are?
77126,L418889,u2313,m149,MANAGER,Monsieur.
77127,L418888,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,I am Comrade Buljanoff.
77128,L418865,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"No, no."
77129,L418864,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?"
77130,L420095,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
77131,L420094,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends."
77132,L420089,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,We have opened a restaurant...
77133,L420088,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Guest?
77134,L420085,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Shall we tell her?
77135,L420084,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
77136,L420083,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"All you have to do is say ""open sesame."""
77137,L420077,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff..."
77138,L420076,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats."
77139,L420075,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"And there is a Russian saying: ""The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."""
77140,L420074,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, ""If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"""
77141,L420073,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
77142,L420068,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"But, Comrades..."
77143,L420067,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
77144,L420066,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin."
77145,L420063,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I must be stern with you.
77146,L420062,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,It is high time you got out of Russia.
77147,L420003,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Don't worry... there will be enough.
77148,L420002,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
77149,L419973,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,I think I need my glasses.
77150,L419972,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
77151,L419968,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,That's right.
77152,L419967,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
77153,L419509,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more."
77154,L419508,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
77155,L419155,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Yes, Comrade."
77156,L419154,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
77157,L419153,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Is there anything I can do, Comrade?"
77158,L419147,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"With two f's, if you please."
77159,L419146,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
77160,L419145,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Yes, Comrade?"
77161,L419144,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Comrade Buljanoff...
77162,L419141,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow."
77163,L419140,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You didn't get legal advice?
77164,L419139,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Which lawyer?
77165,L419125,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Which part of the room is mine?
77166,L419124,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it."
77167,L419120,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
77168,L419119,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,How are things in Moscow?
77169,L419402,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you."
77170,L419401,u2312,m149,LEON,"Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother."
77171,L419394,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, yes, yes."
77172,L419393,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
77173,L419038,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us?
77174,L419037,u2312,m149,LEON,About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
77175,L419031,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?"
77176,L419030,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,"Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?"
77177,L419025,u2312,m149,LEON,"In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand..."
77178,L419024,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,The former Duchess!
77179,L419023,u2312,m149,LEON,The Duchess...
77180,L419022,u2305,m149,BULJANOFF,You think because you represent the former Duchess...
77181,L419347,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Very well, Your Highness."
77182,L419346,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie."
77183,L419345,u2306,m149,GASTON,"A blue shirt, perhaps?"
77184,L419342,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Shall I draw your bath, sir?"
77185,L419341,u2320,m149,SWANA,Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
77186,L419330,u2320,m149,SWANA,That's all right.
77187,L419329,u2306,m149,GASTON,Count d'Algout is still asleep.
77188,L419328,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Good morning, Gaston."
77189,L419327,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Good morning, Your Highness."
77190,L419535,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me."
77191,L419534,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, ""Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike""?"
77192,L419533,u2306,m149,GASTON,"No, sir."
77193,L419532,u2312,m149,LEON,Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
77194,L419531,u2306,m149,GASTON,"No, sir."
77195,L419530,u2312,m149,LEON,"I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?"
77196,L419529,u2306,m149,GASTON,"May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady."
77197,L419528,u2312,m149,LEON,"Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!"
77198,L419527,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet."
77199,L419526,u2312,m149,LEON,"And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something."
77200,L419525,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir."
77201,L419524,u2312,m149,LEON,Have you?
77202,L419523,u2306,m149,GASTON,"If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir."
77203,L419522,u2312,m149,LEON,"I am, Gaston."
77204,L419521,u2306,m149,GASTON,"You seem to be a bit nervous, sir."
77205,L419520,u2312,m149,LEON,I guess it is eight forty-two.
77206,L419519,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Eight forty-two, sir."
77207,L419518,u2312,m149,LEON,"What time have you, Gaston?"
77208,L419340,u2312,m149,LEON,I don't feel like any breakfast.
77209,L419339,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Your breakfast, monsieur."
77210,L419242,u2312,m149,LEON,Go to bed.
77211,L419241,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone..."
77212,L419233,u2306,m149,GASTON,"Good evening, Monsieur."
77213,L419232,u2312,m149,LEON,"Good evening, Gaston."
77214,L419635,u2307,m149,GENERAL SAVITZKY,Certainly.
77215,L419634,u2320,m149,SWANA,"General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments."
77216,L419617,u2307,m149,GENERAL SAVITZKY,Yes.
77217,L419616,u2320,m149,SWANA,"You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?"
77218,L419594,u2320,m149,SWANA,"General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?"
77219,L419593,u2307,m149,GENERAL SAVITZKY,They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
77220,L419592,u2320,m149,SWANA,Are they indeed? Thank you.
77221,L419591,u2307,m149,GENERAL SAVITZKY,I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
77222,L419590,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Yes, General Savitzky?"
77223,L419589,u2307,m149,GENERAL SAVITZKY,Your Highness...
77224,L419585,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Thank you, Louis."
77225,L419584,u2308,m149,HEADWAITER,Is this satisfactory?
77226,L419579,u2320,m149,SWANA,That's perfect!
77227,L419578,u2308,m149,HEADWAITER,"Only one in the rear, I'm afraid."
77228,L419574,u2308,m149,HEADWAITER,It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
77229,L419573,u2320,m149,SWANA,Count d'Algout...
77230,L419572,u2308,m149,HEADWAITER,"Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon."
77231,L419571,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?"
77232,L419570,u2308,m149,HEADWAITER,"Good evening, Your Highness."
77233,L420097,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
77234,L420096,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
77235,L420093,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
77236,L420092,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream..."
77237,L420082,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
77238,L420081,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp..."
77239,L420080,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better."
77240,L420023,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
77241,L420022,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka."
77242,L420008,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
77243,L420007,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne...
77244,L419971,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
77245,L419970,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,It's a real Paris reunion.
77246,L419969,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Let's do that.
77247,L419842,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"While you eat, you look at the view."
77248,L419841,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
77249,L419386,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no."
77250,L419385,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity..."
77251,L419091,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
77252,L419090,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
77253,L419082,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,It is Thursday!
77254,L419081,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
77255,L419040,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Oh, Leon, you are so good."
77256,L419039,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"Leon, my little boy."
77257,L419036,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"What is it, my boy?"
77258,L419035,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Yes, Leon..."
77259,L419021,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
77260,L419020,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
77261,L419008,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
77262,L419007,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,We can call our ambassador.
77263,L419003,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State."
77264,L419002,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense."
77265,L418983,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
77266,L418982,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,We can wait.
77267,L418880,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"He wouldn't say that. What he would say is ""Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"""
77268,L418879,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"If Lenin were alive he would say, ""Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."""
77269,L418878,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
77270,L418873,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in."
77271,L418872,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
77272,L418869,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
77273,L418868,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful."
77274,L419392,u2312,m149,LEON,"No, no."
77275,L419391,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?"
77276,L419381,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,I think she covered you with the parasites.
77277,L419380,u2312,m149,LEON,What did she say about me?
77278,L419379,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
77279,L419052,u2312,m149,LEON,I'll send you a muff.
77280,L419051,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,And if we have to go to Siberia...
77281,L419043,u2312,m149,LEON,"Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow."
77282,L419042,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Razinin.
77283,L419041,u2312,m149,LEON,What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
77284,L419033,u2312,m149,LEON,I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
77285,L419032,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,What proposition?
77286,L419029,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible."
77287,L419028,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
77288,L419027,u2312,m149,LEON,"But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?"
77289,L419026,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?"
77290,L419015,u2312,m149,LEON,"Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance."
77291,L419014,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Get out of here!
77292,L419013,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?"
77293,L418994,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,But you can't...
77294,L418993,u2312,m149,LEON,I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
77295,L418992,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,If you want to see us you must come later.
77296,L418991,u2312,m149,LEON,My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
77297,L418990,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,We don't want to be disturbed.
77298,L420091,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You mean you are deserting Russia?
77299,L420090,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"...we have a wonderful electric sign: ""Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."""
77300,L420061,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas."
77301,L420060,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it."
77302,L420059,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows."
77303,L420058,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski..."
77304,L420021,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Look for yourselves.
77305,L420020,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Bad news?
77306,L419979,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
77307,L419978,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
77308,L419962,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Brave... that's right.
77309,L419961,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave."
77310,L419505,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Too bad we have to waste all that time.
77311,L419504,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, it means another two weeks in Paris."
77312,L419133,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
77313,L419132,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,A cow?
77314,L419131,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?"
77315,L419130,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,A day.
77316,L419129,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,A week?
77317,L419128,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Two thousand francs.
77318,L419127,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,How much does this cost?
77319,L419104,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
77320,L419103,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Comrade.
77321,L419102,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Comrade Kopalski...
77322,L419101,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Comrade.
77323,L419100,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Comrade Buljanoff...
77324,L419099,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues."
77325,L419098,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
77326,L419097,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
77327,L419087,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Right away... instantly!
77328,L419086,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"Yes, monsieur."
77329,L419085,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
77330,L418897,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"But, gentlemen, I am afraid..."
77331,L418896,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,That's even better.
77332,L418895,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe..."
77333,L418894,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,"Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?"
77334,L418893,u2313,m149,MANAGER,I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
77335,L418887,u2313,m149,MANAGER,Monsieur.
77336,L418886,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,This is Comrade Kopalski.
77337,L418867,u2309,m149,IRANOFF,Just looking around.
77338,L418866,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"Yes, monsieur?"
77339,L419390,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon..."
77340,L419389,u2312,m149,LEON,"All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!"
77341,L419388,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
77342,L419387,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!"
77343,L419378,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!"
77344,L419377,u2312,m149,LEON,What's new?
77345,L419050,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!"
77346,L419049,u2312,m149,LEON,"How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski."
77347,L419019,u2312,m149,LEON,All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
77348,L419018,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
77349,L419017,u2312,m149,LEON,Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
77350,L419016,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,We may have a chance.
77351,L418999,u2312,m149,LEON,"Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties."
77352,L418998,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Now, monsieur, you have no right..."
77353,L420079,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
77354,L420078,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,...and Kopalski.
77355,L419997,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too."
77356,L419996,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel...."
77357,L419995,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry."
77358,L419989,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,Even the swallows are back.
77359,L419988,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
77360,L419983,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
77361,L419982,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is."
77362,L419981,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!"
77363,L419980,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
77364,L419958,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Well, we're back home."
77365,L419957,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"How are you, you three scoundrels?"
77366,L419511,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?"
77367,L419510,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,If there is anything we can do for you...
77368,L419507,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you."
77369,L419506,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
77370,L419152,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property."
77371,L419151,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Yes, Comrade."
77372,L419150,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris."
77373,L419149,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,We did it with the best intentions...
77374,L419148,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades..."
77375,L419143,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
77376,L419142,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
77377,L419138,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
77378,L419137,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"We did our best, Comrade."
77379,L419136,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow."
77380,L419122,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat."
77381,L419121,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,What's that?
77382,L419118,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"No, thank you."
77383,L419117,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,"Allow me, Comrade."
77384,L419113,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
77385,L419112,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
77386,L419106,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
77387,L419105,u2310,m149,KOPALSKI,If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
77388,L419503,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Au revoir.
77389,L419502,u2311,m149,LAWYER,"We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame."
77390,L419501,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?"
77391,L419500,u2311,m149,LAWYER,Yes. It is unfortunate.
77392,L419499,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?"
77393,L419498,u2311,m149,LAWYER,We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
77394,L419497,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,That's two weeks from Thursday...
77395,L419496,u2311,m149,LAWYER,The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
77396,L419495,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction..."
77397,L419691,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist."
77398,L419690,u2312,m149,LEON,You want me to go in there?
77399,L419689,u2313,m149,MANAGER,She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
77400,L419688,u2312,m149,LEON,What can I do about it?
77401,L419687,u2313,m149,MANAGER,"That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous."
77402,L419686,u2312,m149,LEON,Give me another double brandy.
77403,L419893,u2312,m149,LEON,Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
77404,L419892,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,Or a tunnel or a bridge...
77405,L419891,u2312,m149,LEON,What for... why?
77406,L419890,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
77407,L419889,u2312,m149,LEON,On what?
77408,L419888,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,Why should I take a chance?
77409,L419887,u2312,m149,LEON,"Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!"
77410,L419886,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,You're going to force us... huh?
77411,L419885,u2312,m149,LEON,That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
77412,L419884,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,Oh no. No visa.
77413,L419883,u2312,m149,LEON,I must get into that country of yours!
77414,L419882,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,No visa.
77415,L419881,u2312,m149,LEON,Yes!
77416,L419880,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
77417,L419879,u2312,m149,LEON,I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
77418,L419878,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,I think so too.
77419,L419877,u2312,m149,LEON,"Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow."
77420,L419876,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,But you had!
77421,L419875,u2312,m149,LEON,"Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!"
77422,L419874,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
77423,L419873,u2312,m149,LEON,She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
77424,L419863,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,You believe in our cause?
77425,L419862,u2312,m149,LEON,On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
77426,L419861,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
77427,L419860,u2312,m149,LEON,Confess what?
77428,L419859,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,"There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!"
77429,L419858,u2312,m149,LEON,Private.
77430,L419857,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,What business?
77431,L419856,u2312,m149,LEON,Business.
77432,L419855,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
77433,L419854,u2312,m149,LEON,Don't hold that against me... please!
77434,L419853,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
77435,L419852,u2312,m149,LEON,Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
77436,L419851,u2315,m149,OFFICIAL,Not always... look at me... I've been back twice.
77437,L419850,u2312,m149,LEON,"Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?"
77438,L420107,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian."
77439,L420106,u2312,m149,LEON,"If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here."
77440,L420105,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"But, Leon, I am only here for a few days."
77441,L420104,u2312,m149,LEON,"I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime."
77442,L420103,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, ""Ninotchka, my darling,"" and ended, ""Yours, Leon."""
77443,L420102,u2312,m149,LEON,"Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back."
77444,L420101,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
77445,L420100,u2312,m149,LEON,They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
77446,L419747,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,So happy and so tired.
77447,L419746,u2312,m149,LEON,"Yes, sweetheart."
77448,L419745,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?"
77449,L419744,u2312,m149,LEON,Please.
77450,L419743,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?"
77451,L419742,u2312,m149,LEON,It is their wish.
77452,L419741,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Is this the wish of the masses?
77453,L419740,u2312,m149,LEON,I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
77454,L419739,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,They belong to the people.
77455,L419738,u2312,m149,LEON,"Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look."
77456,L419736,u2312,m149,LEON,"Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, ""Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"""
77457,L419735,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market."
77458,L419734,u2312,m149,LEON,Who cried that one?
77459,L419733,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
77460,L419732,u2312,m149,LEON,...but big.
77461,L419731,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels...."
77462,L419730,u2312,m149,LEON,But I can throw it out of the window.
77463,L419729,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
77464,L419728,u2312,m149,LEON,"No, no music."
77465,L419727,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,No music.
77466,L419725,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!"
77467,L419724,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,It's dead.
77468,L419723,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven..."
77469,L419722,u2312,m149,LEON,"Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves."
77470,L419721,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?"
77471,L419720,u2312,m149,LEON,What shall we get? The news!
77472,L419718,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see..."
77473,L419717,u2312,m149,LEON,It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
77474,L419716,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Radio! What is radio?
77475,L419715,u2312,m149,LEON,Let's turn on the radio.
77476,L419714,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
77477,L419713,u2312,m149,LEON,All right.
77478,L419712,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Much happier.
77479,L419711,u2312,m149,LEON,Would that make you any happier?
77480,L419710,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall."
77481,L419709,u2312,m149,LEON,I know... it's the Russian soul.
77482,L419708,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling."
77483,L419707,u2312,m149,LEON,Yes... a kiss... salute!
77484,L419706,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Our salute will be a kiss.
77485,L419705,u2312,m149,LEON,No! No!
77486,L419704,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,...and we won't clench our fist...
77487,L419703,u2312,m149,LEON,No! No!
77488,L419702,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,And we won't stretch up our arms...
77489,L419701,u2312,m149,LEON,Right: Lovers of the world unite!
77490,L419700,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party."
77491,L419699,u2312,m149,LEON,"All right, we'll make it red."
77492,L419698,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Not white, darling."
77493,L419697,u2312,m149,LEON,Yes... a little white house.
77494,L419696,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Are we going to build our little house?
77495,L419695,u2312,m149,LEON,No. Nobody will find us.
77496,L419694,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart."
77497,L419683,u2312,m149,LEON,"And I adore you, Ninotchua."
77498,L419682,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I love you, my little Leonitchka!"
77499,L419681,u2312,m149,LEON,No speech.
77500,L419680,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,No speech?
77501,L419679,u2312,m149,LEON,"Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down."
77502,L419678,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
77503,L419677,u2312,m149,LEON,"Now, Ninotchka... please!"
77504,L419676,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Comrades! Good people of France!
77505,L419675,u2312,m149,LEON,"But, darling, you can't do that."
77506,L419674,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
77507,L419673,u2312,m149,LEON,Shhh! Shhh!
77508,L419672,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I must talk to my brothers!
77509,L419671,u2312,m149,LEON,"Darling, darling... please!"
77510,L419670,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Comrades! Comrades!
77511,L419669,u2312,m149,LEON,Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
77512,L419668,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Thursday.
77513,L419667,u2312,m149,LEON,"What, darling?"
77514,L419666,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!"
77515,L419665,u2312,m149,LEON,You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
77516,L419664,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
77517,L419662,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,To the loveliest story I ever heard.
77518,L419661,u2312,m149,LEON,"You must, darling."
77519,L419660,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
77520,L419659,u2312,m149,LEON,"No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?"
77521,L419658,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Go on.
77522,L419657,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street."
77523,L419656,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
77524,L419655,u2312,m149,LEON,A funny story?
77525,L419654,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories."
77526,L419629,u2312,m149,LEON,And General Savitzky.
77527,L419628,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,How do you do?
77528,L419612,u2312,m149,LEON,"There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!"
77529,L419611,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
77530,L419609,u2312,m149,LEON,From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
77531,L419608,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne."
77532,L419607,u2312,m149,LEON,It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
77533,L419606,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
77534,L419569,u2312,m149,LEON,My darling.
77535,L419568,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it."
77536,L419567,u2312,m149,LEON,"Ninotchka, you're jealous."
77537,L419566,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous..."
77538,L419565,u2312,m149,LEON,"Ninotchka, I love you."
77539,L419564,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?"
77540,L419562,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
77541,L419561,u2312,m149,LEON,I don't think so.
77542,L419560,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Did you make any change in this room?
77543,L419559,u2312,m149,LEON,I promise... I swear.
77544,L419558,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth."
77545,L419557,u2312,m149,LEON,"Anything, Ninotchka."
77546,L419556,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Leon, I would like to ask you something."
77547,L419554,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it..."
77548,L419553,u2312,m149,LEON,No... go on.
77549,L419552,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?"
77550,L419551,u2312,m149,LEON,You see I couldn't shout that.
77551,L419548,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
77552,L419547,u2312,m149,LEON,A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
77553,L419546,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?"
77554,L419545,u2312,m149,LEON,"That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, ""What are your plans for this evening, madame?"""
77555,L419544,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,It's nine o'clock.
77556,L419543,u2312,m149,LEON,Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
77557,L419542,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"For twelve francs, seventy-five."
77558,L419541,u2312,m149,LEON,You see? Life can be so simple.
77559,L419540,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said ""Eight Rue du Bois""... and here I am."
77560,L419539,u2312,m149,LEON,You remember this room?
77561,L419538,u2312,m149,LEON,"Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, ""Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other."" Ninotchka feels more comfortable."
77562,L419537,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I don't look too foolish?
77563,L419491,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, ""Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee."" So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, ""I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee.""...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, ""Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream,"" and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, ""I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"""
77564,L419490,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
77565,L419489,u2312,m149,LEON,He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
77566,L419488,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
77567,L419487,u2312,m149,LEON,I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
77568,L419486,u2312,m149,LEON,So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
77569,L419485,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,No.
77570,L419484,u2312,m149,LEON,"Not funny, huh?"
77571,L419482,u2312,m149,LEON,"Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!"
77572,L419481,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I don't think so.
77573,L419480,u2312,m149,LEON,It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
77574,L419479,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,No.
77575,L419478,u2312,m149,LEON,I suppose you don't think that's funny?
77576,L419477,u2312,m149,LEON,"So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, ""Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?"" ""Yes, it is,"" says the other, ""five hundred million."" ""Whew!"" replies the first, ""they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!"" Ha! Ha! Ha!"
77577,L419476,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I wish they had never met.
77578,L419475,u2312,m149,LEON,"Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, ""Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy,"" and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, ""Hello, Mr. McIntosh,"" and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, ""How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?"" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, ""How is Mrs. McIntosh?""..."
77579,L419474,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I have never heard one.
77580,L419473,u2312,m149,LEON,Do you like Scotch stories?
77581,L419472,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Probably not.
77582,L419471,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one."
77583,L419470,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,On which boat?
77584,L419469,u2312,m149,LEON,"That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America..."
77585,L419468,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Ha! Ha! Now go back.
77586,L419467,u2312,m149,LEON,"No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once."
77587,L419466,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Then you should go back to your table.
77588,L419465,u2312,m149,LEON,Because we are an odd couple.
77589,L419464,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Why?
77590,L419463,u2312,m149,LEON,At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
77591,L419462,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,At what?
77592,L419461,u2312,m149,LEON,Just smile.
77593,L419460,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Why?
77594,L419459,u2312,m149,LEON,Will you smile?
77595,L419458,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,What?
77596,L419457,u2312,m149,LEON,"Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!"
77597,L419456,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death."
77598,L419455,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?"
77599,L419454,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski."
77600,L419453,u2312,m149,LEON,Must one always be after something?
77601,L419452,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,What are you after?
77602,L419451,u2312,m149,LEON,Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
77603,L419445,u2312,m149,LEON,"But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?"
77604,L419444,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,This is a place for workmen.
77605,L419443,u2312,m149,LEON,I always eat here.
77606,L419442,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Then how did you get here?
77607,L419441,u2312,m149,LEON,I didn't follow you.
77608,L419440,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I don't like your following me.
77609,L419439,u2312,m149,LEON,"Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!"
77610,L419413,u2312,m149,LEON,"So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!"
77611,L419412,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people."
77612,L419411,u2312,m149,LEON,Room service speaking.
77613,L419326,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
77614,L419325,u2312,m149,LEON,"But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!"
77615,L419323,u2312,m149,LEON,"Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye."
77616,L419322,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Then do it through my lawyer!
77617,L419321,u2312,m149,LEON,You know I want to...
77618,L419320,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
77619,L419319,u2312,m149,LEON,Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
77620,L419318,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,As a representative of Moscow...
77621,L419317,u2312,m149,LEON,"All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy."
77622,L419316,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I was sent here by my country to fight you.
77623,L419315,u2312,m149,LEON,I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
77624,L419314,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Let's forget that we ever met.
77625,L419313,u2312,m149,LEON,"Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova..."
77626,L419312,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I must go.
77627,L419306,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
77628,L419305,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, let it ring."
77629,L419304,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,The telephone is ringing.
77630,L419303,u2312,m149,LEON,"Glorious, analytical..."
77631,L419302,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical..."
77632,L419301,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Thank you.
77633,L419300,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"No, that was restful. Again."
77634,L419299,u2312,m149,LEON,Was that talkative?
77635,L419297,u2312,m149,LEON,"You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?"
77636,L419296,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,It's false sentimentality.
77637,L419295,u2312,m149,LEON,I can't possibly think of a better reason.
77638,L419294,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
77639,L419293,u2312,m149,LEON,It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
77640,L419292,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,It's twelve o'clock.
77641,L419291,u2312,m149,LEON,Do you hear that?
77642,L419290,u2312,m149,LEON,"You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant."
77643,L419289,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
77644,L419288,u2312,m149,LEON,"What kind of a girl are you, anyway?"
77645,L419287,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive."
77646,L419286,u2312,m149,LEON,"Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka."
77647,L419285,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
77648,L419284,u2312,m149,LEON,"I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk."
77649,L419283,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
77650,L419282,u2312,m149,LEON,Wounded? How?
77651,L419281,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I was wounded before Warsaw.
77652,L419280,u2312,m149,LEON,The bayonet? Did you really?
77653,L419279,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet."
77654,L419278,u2312,m149,LEON,"I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois."
77655,L419277,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Don't do it, please."
77656,L419276,u2312,m149,LEON,I'd like to say it a thousand times.
77657,L419275,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You repeat yourself.
77658,L419274,u2312,m149,LEON,"You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka..."
77659,L419273,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
77660,L419272,u2312,m149,LEON,What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
77661,L419271,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
77662,L419270,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, I see. What do you use instead?"
77663,L419269,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it."
77664,L419268,u2312,m149,LEON,Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
77665,L419267,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
77666,L419266,u2312,m149,LEON,Thank you.
77667,L419265,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Your general appearance is not distasteful.
77668,L419264,u2312,m149,LEON,"Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?"
77669,L419263,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,That is correct.
77670,L419262,u2312,m149,LEON,Ni-notchka.
77671,L419261,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
77672,L419260,u2312,m149,LEON,"I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka."
77673,L419259,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,That is why I believe in the future of my country.
77674,L419258,u2312,m149,LEON,Thank you. Thank you.
77675,L419257,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You are something we do not have in Russia.
77676,L419256,u2312,m149,LEON,For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
77677,L419255,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,And what do you do for mankind?
77678,L419254,u2312,m149,LEON,"Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job."
77679,L419253,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,And what is your profession?
77680,L419252,u2312,m149,LEON,That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
77681,L419251,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I will start with you.
77682,L419250,u2312,m149,LEON,"Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?"
77683,L419249,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
77684,L419248,u2312,m149,LEON,"It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio."
77685,L419247,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Is that customary?
77686,L419246,u2312,m149,LEON,We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
77687,L419245,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,What do we do now?
77688,L419244,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
77689,L419243,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?"
77690,L419240,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone."
77691,L419239,u2312,m149,LEON,"No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water."
77692,L419238,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,He looks sad. Do you whip him?
77693,L419237,u2312,m149,LEON,He takes good care of that.
77694,L419236,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work."
77695,L419235,u2312,m149,LEON,Yes.
77696,L419234,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Is this what you call the ""butler""?"
77697,L419230,u2312,m149,LEON,I will do my best.
77698,L419229,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
77699,L419228,u2312,m149,LEON,Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
77700,L419227,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Then you don't want me to go there.
77701,L419226,u2312,m149,LEON,Please don't misunderstand me...
77702,L419225,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Does that mean that you want me to go there?
77703,L419224,u2312,m149,LEON,"Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway..."
77704,L419223,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,So that is your house?
77705,L419222,u2312,m149,LEON,It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
77706,L419221,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
77707,L419220,u2312,m149,LEON,"What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?"
77708,L419219,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity."
77709,L419218,u2312,m149,LEON,You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
77710,L419217,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you."
77711,L419216,u2312,m149,LEON,I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
77712,L419215,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Yes, it is."
77713,L419214,u2312,m149,LEON,"And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?"
77714,L419213,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
77715,L419211,u2312,m149,LEON,"Yes, very strange."
77716,L419210,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,That's a strange angle.
77717,L419209,u2312,m149,LEON,"Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees..."
77718,L419208,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Go ahead.
77719,L419207,u2312,m149,LEON,The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
77720,L419203,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Your type will soon be extinct.
77721,L419202,u2312,m149,LEON,A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
77722,L419201,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
77723,L419200,u2312,m149,LEON,Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
77724,L419199,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?"
77725,L419198,u2312,m149,LEON,"Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is."
77726,L419197,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
77727,L419196,u2312,m149,LEON,I'll try.
77728,L419195,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Suppress it.
77729,L419194,u2312,m149,LEON,I don't have to but I find it natural.
77730,L419193,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
77731,L419192,u2312,m149,LEON,Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
77732,L419191,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,And where are we?
77733,L419190,u2312,m149,LEON,Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
77734,L419189,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Why do you need my finger?
77735,L419188,u2312,m149,LEON,"Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please."
77736,L419187,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,How long does it take a man to land?
77737,L419186,u2312,m149,LEON,"Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off."
77738,L419185,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
77739,L419184,u2312,m149,LEON,Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
77740,L419183,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
77741,L419182,u2312,m149,LEON,Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
77742,L419181,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?"
77743,L419180,u2312,m149,LEON,Love to.
77744,L419179,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You might hold this for me.
77745,L419178,u2312,m149,LEON,Can I help you?
77746,L419177,u2312,m149,LEON,You're welcome.
77747,L419176,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Thank you.
77748,L419175,u2312,m149,LEON,No.
77749,L419174,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,In other words you don't know.
77750,L419173,u2312,m149,LEON,Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
77751,L419172,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
77752,L419171,u2312,m149,LEON,That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
77753,L419170,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
77754,L419169,u2312,m149,LEON,What?
77755,L419168,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,At what intervals does he whistle?
77756,L419167,u2312,m149,LEON,Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
77757,L419166,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,How long do we have to wait here?
77758,L419165,u2312,m149,LEON,Gladly.
77759,L419164,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Yes. Could you give me some information?
77760,L419163,u2312,m149,LEON,Me?
77761,L419162,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You, please."
77762,L419872,u2312,m149,LEON,"Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious."
77763,L419871,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change..."
77764,L419870,u2312,m149,LEON,"That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser."
77765,L419869,u2320,m149,SWANA,Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
77766,L419868,u2312,m149,LEON,"Now, please, Swana."
77767,L419867,u2320,m149,SWANA,"After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia."
77768,L419866,u2312,m149,LEON,Hello.
77769,L419865,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Hello, Leon darling!"
77770,L419837,u2312,m149,LEON,Do you expect me to believe that?
77771,L419836,u2320,m149,SWANA,"She's gone, Leon."
77772,L419835,u2312,m149,LEON,Has done what?
77773,L419834,u2320,m149,SWANA,Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
77774,L419833,u2312,m149,LEON,"What is this, Swana?"
77775,L419832,u2320,m149,SWANA,"The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes."
77776,L419831,u2312,m149,LEON,I'm afraid that's what it is.
77777,L419830,u2320,m149,SWANA,Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
77778,L419829,u2312,m149,LEON,"I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living."
77779,L419828,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?"
77780,L419827,u2312,m149,LEON,"It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana."
77781,L419826,u2320,m149,SWANA,And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
77782,L419825,u2312,m149,LEON,"There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana."
77783,L419824,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Brutal frankness, if you insist."
77784,L419823,u2312,m149,LEON,"I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?"
77785,L419822,u2320,m149,SWANA,"All right, I'll listen."
77786,L419821,u2312,m149,LEON,"This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen."
77787,L419820,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll..."
77788,L419819,u2312,m149,LEON,Yes.
77789,L419818,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?"
77790,L419817,u2312,m149,LEON,I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
77791,L419816,u2320,m149,SWANA,Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
77792,L419815,u2312,m149,LEON,"No thanks, Swana."
77793,L419814,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?"
77794,L419649,u2320,m149,SWANA,"A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?"
77795,L419648,u2312,m149,LEON,Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
77796,L419643,u2320,m149,SWANA,"I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?"
77797,L419642,u2312,m149,LEON,"There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?"
77798,L419639,u2320,m149,SWANA,Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
77799,L419638,u2312,m149,LEON,"Months, Swana."
77800,L419637,u2320,m149,SWANA,"He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?"
77801,L419633,u2312,m149,LEON,No... please...
77802,L419632,u2320,m149,SWANA,"I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?"
77803,L419627,u2320,m149,SWANA,How do you do?
77804,L419626,u2312,m149,LEON,"Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?"
77805,L419625,u2320,m149,SWANA,Am I interrupting?
77806,L419624,u2312,m149,LEON,"Yes, Swana."
77807,L419623,u2320,m149,SWANA,"It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?"
77808,L419622,u2312,m149,LEON,"Yes, Swana, you did."
77809,L419621,u2320,m149,SWANA,Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
77810,L419620,u2312,m149,LEON,"Yes, Swana."
77811,L419619,u2320,m149,SWANA,Is this your new dress suit?
77812,L419618,u2312,m149,LEON,Thank you.
77813,L419362,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you."
77814,L419361,u2312,m149,LEON,"Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!"
77815,L419360,u2320,m149,SWANA,You saw all that in one glimpse?
77816,L419359,u2312,m149,LEON,Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
77817,L419358,u2320,m149,SWANA,That bad?  Old or young?
77818,L419357,u2312,m149,LEON,You can't imagine.
77819,L419356,u2320,m149,SWANA,Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
77820,L419355,u2312,m149,LEON,Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
77821,L419354,u2320,m149,SWANA,You just told me you hadn't seen her.
77822,L419353,u2312,m149,LEON,That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
77823,L419352,u2320,m149,SWANA,That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
77824,L419351,u2312,m149,LEON,"No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera..."
77825,L419350,u2320,m149,SWANA,You haven't seen her yet?
77826,L419349,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her."
77827,L419348,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!"
77828,L419344,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time."
77829,L419343,u2312,m149,LEON,Make it ice cold.
77830,L419337,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting."
77831,L419336,u2312,m149,LEON,I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
77832,L419335,u2320,m149,SWANA,Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
77833,L419334,u2312,m149,LEON,No.
77834,L419333,u2320,m149,SWANA,Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
77835,L419332,u2312,m149,LEON,Huh?
77836,L419331,u2320,m149,SWANA,Leon! What in heaven's name...!
77837,L418974,u2312,m149,LEON,"Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?"
77838,L418973,u2320,m149,SWANA,"It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!"
77839,L418972,u2312,m149,LEON,What did he say?
77840,L418971,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!"
77841,L418970,u2312,m149,LEON,What does he say?
77842,L418969,u2320,m149,SWANA,"This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!"
77843,L418965,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!"
77844,L418964,u2312,m149,LEON,Did I hear something about jewels?
77845,L418951,u2320,m149,SWANA,Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
77846,L418950,u2312,m149,LEON,"Oh, yes."
77847,L418949,u2320,m149,SWANA,"He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him."
77848,L418945,u2312,m149,LEON,Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
77849,L418944,u2320,m149,SWANA,Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
77850,L418943,u2312,m149,LEON,"Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?"
77851,L418942,u2320,m149,SWANA,A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
77852,L418941,u2312,m149,LEON,"I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. ""Caviar and Blood."" Swana escapes over the ice!"
77853,L418940,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: ""A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."""
77854,L418939,u2312,m149,LEON,"Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman."
77855,L418938,u2320,m149,SWANA,"First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?"
77856,L418937,u2312,m149,LEON,"Now, Swana..."
77857,L418936,u2320,m149,SWANA,My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
77858,L418934,u2320,m149,SWANA,Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
77859,L418933,u2312,m149,LEON,"I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!"
77860,L418932,u2320,m149,SWANA,Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
77861,L418931,u2312,m149,LEON,"Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!"
77862,L418930,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Oh, Leon!"
77863,L418929,u2312,m149,LEON,"Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. ""The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia""!"
77864,L418928,u2320,m149,SWANA,What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
77865,L418927,u2312,m149,LEON,You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
77866,L418926,u2320,m149,SWANA,Those newspaper people?
77867,L418925,u2312,m149,LEON,We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
77868,L418924,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Oh, Leon, you are so good to me."
77869,L418923,u2312,m149,LEON,"We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me."
77870,L418922,u2320,m149,SWANA,Did you win?
77871,L418921,u2312,m149,LEON,"Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests."
77872,L418920,u2320,m149,SWANA,Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
77873,L418919,u2312,m149,LEON,"Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer."
77874,L418918,u2320,m149,SWANA,"It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves."
77875,L418917,u2312,m149,LEON,"Good morning, Swana."
77876,L418916,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Hello, Leon!"
77877,L419804,u2320,m149,SWANA,"I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova."
77878,L419803,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
77879,L419802,u2320,m149,SWANA,I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
77880,L419801,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Go on.
77881,L419800,u2320,m149,SWANA,"No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after."
77882,L419799,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
77883,L419798,u2320,m149,SWANA,"I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait."
77884,L419797,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now..."
77885,L419796,u2320,m149,SWANA,"My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative."
77886,L419795,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
77887,L419794,u2320,m149,SWANA,Unfortunately.
77888,L419793,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet."
77889,L419792,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels."
77890,L419791,u2320,m149,SWANA,I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
77891,L419790,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!"
77892,L419789,u2320,m149,SWANA,"That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!"
77893,L419788,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them."
77894,L419787,u2320,m149,SWANA,Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
77895,L419786,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You leave me no choice.
77896,L419785,u2320,m149,SWANA,Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
77897,L419784,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Where are they?
77898,L419783,u2320,m149,SWANA,"You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with."
77899,L419782,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Where are they?
77900,L419781,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it."
77901,L419780,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I told you to go, madame."
77902,L419779,u2320,m149,SWANA,I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
77903,L419777,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,In that case I can only say good-by.
77904,L419776,u2320,m149,SWANA,Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
77905,L419775,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I must insist that you leave.
77906,L419774,u2320,m149,SWANA,You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
77907,L419773,u2320,m149,SWANA,"My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?"
77908,L419772,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony."
77909,L419771,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox."
77910,L419770,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning."
77911,L419769,u2320,m149,SWANA,"My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you."
77912,L419768,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
77913,L419767,u2320,m149,SWANA,Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
77914,L419766,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Madame, if you..."
77915,L419765,u2320,m149,SWANA,Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
77916,L419764,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I must ask you to leave.
77917,L419763,u2320,m149,SWANA,That's all right... I grow on people.
77918,L419762,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... ""I am delighted to have you here""? I have not reached that stage of civilization."
77919,L419761,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull."
77920,L419760,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,We have nothing to discuss.
77921,L419759,u2320,m149,SWANA,I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
77922,L419758,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Please come to the point. What is it you want?
77923,L419757,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least."
77924,L419756,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
77925,L419755,u2320,m149,SWANA,How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
77926,L419754,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat."
77927,L419753,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
77928,L419751,u2320,m149,SWANA,"It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana."
77929,L419750,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,What?
77930,L419749,u2320,m149,SWANA,Good morning.
77931,L419651,u2320,m149,SWANA,"It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon."
77932,L419650,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday."
77933,L419647,u2320,m149,SWANA,You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
77934,L419646,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are."
77935,L419645,u2320,m149,SWANA,Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
77936,L419641,u2320,m149,SWANA,Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
77937,L419640,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame."
77938,L419116,u2316,m149,PORTER,That depends on the tip.
77939,L419115,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,That's no business... that's a social injustice.
77940,L419114,u2316,m149,PORTER,"Well... that's my business, madame."
77941,L419111,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Why?
77942,L419110,u2316,m149,PORTER,"May I have your bags, madame?"
77943,L419109,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,What do you want?
77944,L419108,u2316,m149,PORTER,"Here, please..."
77945,L420054,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I will do my best.
77946,L420053,u2319,m149,RAZININ,"Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by."
77947,L420052,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go."
77948,L420051,u2319,m149,RAZININ,I don't understand.
77949,L420050,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me."
77950,L420049,u2319,m149,RAZININ,"That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova."
77951,L420048,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne."
77952,L420047,u2319,m149,RAZININ,Yes... leaving immediately.
77953,L420046,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,You want me to go to Constantinople?
77954,L420045,u2319,m149,RAZININ,It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
77955,L420044,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?"
77956,L420043,u2319,m149,RAZININ,"As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club. Here...  ""How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"""
77957,L420042,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,May I ask what has happened?
77958,L420041,u2319,m149,RAZININ,"I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal."
77959,L420040,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,No.
77960,L420039,u2319,m149,RAZININ,"Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?"
77961,L420038,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Thank you.
77962,L420037,u2319,m149,RAZININ,Cigarette?
77963,L420036,u2319,m149,RAZININ,Please... sit down.
77964,L420035,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,May I ask why?
77965,L420034,u2319,m149,RAZININ,"Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else."
77966,L420033,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
77967,L420032,u2319,m149,RAZININ,That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
77968,L420031,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
77969,L420030,u2319,m149,RAZININ,You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
77970,L420029,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Yes, it does."
77971,L420028,u2319,m149,RAZININ,Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
77972,L420027,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,"Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months."
77973,L420026,u2319,m149,RAZININ,"Good morning, Comrade."
77974,L419438,u2317,m149,PRE MATHIEU,"That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu."
77975,L419437,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,The future of the common people.
77976,L419436,u2317,m149,PRE MATHIEU,"But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?"
77977,L419435,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
77978,L419429,u2317,m149,PRE MATHIEU,"Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow."
77979,L419428,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Raw carrots and beets.
77980,L419427,u2317,m149,PRE MATHIEU,"I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?"
77981,L419426,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,This will do.
77982,L419425,u2317,m149,PRE MATHIEU,"This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?"
77983,L419423,u2321,m149,TAXI DRIVER,Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
77984,L419422,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Where is it?
77985,L419421,u2321,m149,TAXI DRIVER,It's just a place for workmen.
77986,L419420,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Where is that?
77987,L419419,u2321,m149,TAXI DRIVER,At Pre Mathieu's.
77988,L419418,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Where do you eat?
77989,L419417,u2321,m149,TAXI DRIVER,"Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's..."
77990,L419416,u2314,m149,NINOTCHKA,Can you recommend a restaurant?
77991,L419415,u2321,m149,TAXI DRIVER,"Where to, madame?"
77992,L418968,u2320,m149,SWANA,"Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you."
77993,L418967,u2318,m149,RAKONIN,I am sorry... I have to leave.
77994,L418963,u2318,m149,RAKONIN,"This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!"
77995,L418962,u2320,m149,SWANA,Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
77996,L418961,u2318,m149,RAKONIN,They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
77997,L418960,u2320,m149,SWANA,Why do you bring this up after so many years?
77998,L418959,u2318,m149,RAKONIN,"I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels."
77999,L418958,u2320,m149,SWANA,My jewels?!
78000,L418957,u2318,m149,RAKONIN,"No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels."
78001,L418956,u2320,m149,SWANA,"What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?"
78002,L418955,u2318,m149,RAKONIN,"Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but..."
78003,L418954,u2320,m149,SWANA,"How do you do, my friend."
78004,L418953,u2318,m149,RAKONIN,Your Highness.
78005,L421469,u2322,m150,BUZHARDT,"But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ..."
78006,L421468,u2340,m150,NIXON,"For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!"
78007,L421459,u2340,m150,NIXON,You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
78008,L421458,u2322,m150,BUZHARDT,"We could check the tape again, sir."
78009,L421457,u2340,m150,NIXON,Never.  I never said that about Jews!
78010,L421456,u2322,m150,BUZHARDT,"You did say it, sir."
78011,L421455,u2340,m150,NIXON,You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
78012,L421421,u2340,m150,NIXON,Then tell Richardson to fire him.
78013,L421420,u2322,m150,BUZHARDT,"Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ..."
78014,L421395,u2340,m150,NIXON,They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
78015,L421394,u2322,m150,BUZHARDT,"Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ..."
78016,L420892,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino."
78017,L420891,u2323,m150,CUSHMAN,"That's Helms.  He's ""sang froid,"" a world-class poker player."
78018,L420890,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well, he certainly isn't acting like it."
78019,L420889,u2323,m150,CUSHMAN,"He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director."
78020,L420888,u2340,m150,NIXON,We'll see about that ...
78021,L420887,u2323,m150,CUSHMAN,"Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff."
78022,L420886,u2340,m150,NIXON,"How's the job coming, Bob?"
78023,L420885,u2323,m150,CUSHMAN,Then his office will be fine.
78024,L420884,u2340,m150,NIXON,No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
78025,L420883,u2323,m150,CUSHMAN,He told me to take you to his conference room.
78026,L420882,u2340,m150,NIXON,So ... let's go ...
78027,L420881,u2323,m150,CUSHMAN,"Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ..."
78028,L420880,u2340,m150,NIXON,Where the hell is he?
78029,L420879,u2323,m150,CUSHMAN,"Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute."
78030,L421320,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you."
78031,L421319,u2324,m150,DEAN,"I understand that, sir."
78032,L421318,u2340,m150,NIXON,"John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, ""On the road of the informer, it's always night.""  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency."
78033,L421317,u2324,m150,DEAN,I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
78034,L421316,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John."
78035,L421315,u2324,m150,DEAN,You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
78036,L421312,u2340,m150,NIXON,We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
78037,L421311,u2324,m150,DEAN,"No, we have nothing to hide."
78038,L421310,u2340,m150,NIXON,"He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?"
78039,L421307,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: ""Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that."" ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility."
78040,L421306,u2324,m150,DEAN,I agree it's ridiculous but --
78041,L421305,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?"
78042,L421304,u2324,m150,DEAN,"Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ..."
78043,L421303,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ..."
78044,L421302,u2324,m150,DEAN,"I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses."
78045,L421301,u2340,m150,NIXON,We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
78046,L421300,u2324,m150,DEAN,Uh huh ...
78047,L421299,u2340,m150,NIXON,We could get that.
78048,L421298,u2324,m150,DEAN,"Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ..."
78049,L421297,u2340,m150,NIXON,How much do you need?
78050,L421256,u2324,m150,DEAN,Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
78051,L421255,u2340,m150,NIXON,Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
78052,L421244,u2340,m150,NIXON,I like that.  That's a solution.
78053,L421243,u2324,m150,DEAN,Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
78054,L421242,u2340,m150,NIXON,What?
78055,L421241,u2324,m150,DEAN,Executive clemency ...
78056,L421221,u2340,m150,NIXON,Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
78057,L421220,u2324,m150,DEAN,"He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge."
78058,L421219,u2340,m150,NIXON,Son of a bitch.
78059,L421218,u2324,m150,DEAN,"Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand."
78060,L421180,u2340,m150,NIXON,Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
78061,L421179,u2324,m150,DEAN,Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
78062,L421178,u2340,m150,NIXON,"So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous."
78063,L420174,u2340,m150,NIXON,"""Ex-CIA""?  There's no such thing as ""ex-CIA,"" John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?"
78064,L420173,u2324,m150,DEAN,"The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA."
78065,L421293,u2332,m150,HUNT,"John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard."
78066,L421292,u2324,m150,DEAN,"Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you."
78067,L421291,u2332,m150,HUNT,I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
78068,L421290,u2324,m150,DEAN,To protect his people.
78069,L421289,u2332,m150,HUNT,"That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?"
78070,L421288,u2324,m150,DEAN,How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
78071,L421286,u2332,m150,HUNT,"In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall."
78072,L421285,u2324,m150,DEAN,Is it?
78073,L421284,u2332,m150,HUNT,I'll bet he would.
78074,L421283,u2324,m150,DEAN,The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
78075,L421282,u2332,m150,HUNT,Yes ... I got the money.
78076,L421281,u2324,m150,DEAN,I was sorry to hear about your wife.
78077,L421278,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,So you tell Mitchell ...
78078,L421277,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Dick Nixon saying ""I'm sorry""? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off."
78079,L421276,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Eight words back in '72 -- ""I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry"" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him."
78080,L421275,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans."
78081,L421274,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the ""P"" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits."
78082,L421273,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Yeah?
78083,L421272,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
78084,L421271,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,I figured that out.
78085,L421270,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,It's a code or something.
78086,L421267,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,You think this is just about politics?
78087,L421266,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"The ""Old Man"" plays politics harder than anybody else."
78088,L421265,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson."
78089,L421264,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,How so?
78090,L421263,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman."
78091,L421262,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
78092,L421261,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Why me?
78093,L421260,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,You do it.
78094,L421259,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
78095,L421169,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ..."
78096,L421168,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
78097,L420869,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ..."
78098,L420868,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote."
78099,L420169,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time."
78100,L420168,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
78101,L421253,u2340,m150,NIXON,"We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ..."
78102,L421252,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
78103,L421251,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify."
78104,L421250,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee."
78105,L421249,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies."
78106,L421246,u2340,m150,NIXON,"And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?"
78107,L421245,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts."
78108,L421238,u2340,m150,NIXON,Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
78109,L421237,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,What about England?
78110,L421196,u2340,m150,NIXON,"My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school."
78111,L421195,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
78112,L421194,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president."
78113,L421176,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, no.  He's our only ""star"" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to."
78114,L421175,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"I would personally enjoy doing that, sir."
78115,L421171,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... ""unstable.""  Claims he has to handle you ""with kid gloves"" ..."
78116,L421170,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, you didn't, Bob."
78117,L421114,u2340,m150,NIXON,"The hard-core four million ""Nixon nuts"" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists."
78118,L421113,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,The country's loving it.
78119,L420878,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted."
78120,L420877,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile."
78121,L420875,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?"
78122,L420874,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America."
78123,L420843,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ..."
78124,L420842,u2340,m150,NIXON,"The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!"
78125,L420839,u2340,m150,NIXON,-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.
78126,L420838,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,I thought the gloves were off.
78127,L420837,u2340,m150,NIXON,We can't touch Hoover --
78128,L420822,u2340,m150,NIXON,No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
78129,L420821,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support."
78130,L420809,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance."
78131,L420808,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
78132,L420807,u2340,m150,NIXON,Why not?
78133,L420806,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"I don't know if I'd go that far, sir."
78134,L420805,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!"
78135,L420275,u2340,m150,NIXON,We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
78136,L420274,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"No, sir."
78137,L420273,u2340,m150,NIXON,"This is not a joke, John!"
78138,L420272,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?"
78139,L420271,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
78140,L420260,u2340,m150,NIXON,"What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him."
78141,L420259,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
78142,L420258,u2340,m150,NIXON,Pay him.
78143,L420257,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,He wants money.
78144,L420256,u2340,m150,NIXON,And?
78145,L420255,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
78146,L420254,u2340,m150,NIXON,Where's Hunt now?
78147,L420233,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48."
78148,L420232,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
78149,L420231,u2340,m150,NIXON,I like it.  I like the idea.
78150,L420208,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?"
78151,L420207,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around."
78152,L420189,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
78153,L420188,u2340,m150,NIXON,Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
78154,L420186,u2340,m150,NIXON,Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
78155,L420185,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,"Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll."
78156,L420184,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again."
78157,L420176,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Find out what the hell he was doing at ""CREEP.""  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up."
78158,L420175,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,McCord? ...
78159,L420172,u2340,m150,NIXON,No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
78160,L420171,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Mitchell?
78161,L420170,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?"
78162,L420167,u2340,m150,NIXON,Jesus!  Through a window?
78163,L420166,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
78164,L420165,u2340,m150,NIXON,Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
78165,L420164,u2325,m150,EHRLICHMAN,Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
78166,L421530,u2340,m150,NIXON,"That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed."
78167,L421529,u2326,m150,HAIG,Sir?
78168,L421528,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It came over from Vietnam, you know."
78169,L421527,u2326,m150,HAIG,"I know it well, sir."
78170,L421526,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ..."
78171,L421505,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
78172,L421504,u2326,m150,HAIG,"... you mentioned the ""Bay of Pigs"" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ..."
78173,L421503,u2340,m150,NIXON,I don't know anything about that.
78174,L421502,u2326,m150,HAIG,"Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --"
78175,L421501,u2340,m150,NIXON,That's right ...
78176,L421500,u2326,m150,HAIG,"Sir, you talked about opening up the whole ""Bay of Pigs"" thing again."
78177,L421499,u2340,m150,NIXON,There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
78178,L421498,u2326,m150,HAIG,"We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt."
78179,L421497,u2326,m150,HAIG,How do you see this?
78180,L421496,u2340,m150,NIXON,That was civil war.
78181,L421495,u2326,m150,HAIG,Lincoln used it.
78182,L421494,u2340,m150,NIXON,The army?
78183,L421492,u2340,m150,NIXON,And if I stay?
78184,L421491,u2326,m150,HAIG,"If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years."
78185,L421490,u2326,m150,HAIG,"It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it."
78186,L421489,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Can we get around this, Al?"
78187,L421488,u2326,m150,HAIG,"Sir, the deadline is today."
78188,L421487,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
78189,L421486,u2326,m150,HAIG,"Your lawyers feel it's the ... ""smoking gun."""
78190,L421485,u2340,m150,NIXON,So?
78191,L421484,u2326,m150,HAIG,"June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI."
78192,L421483,u2326,m150,HAIG,"I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President."
78193,L421482,u2340,m150,NIXON,"""Victory at Sea,"" Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks."
78194,L421474,u2340,m150,NIXON,I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first.  And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
78195,L421473,u2326,m150,HAIG,He's completely lost touch with reality.
78196,L421472,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ..."
78197,L421423,u2340,m150,NIXON,"The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ..."
78198,L421422,u2326,m150,HAIG,Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
78199,L421419,u2326,m150,HAIG,But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
78200,L421418,u2340,m150,NIXON,Cox!  Fire him.
78201,L421417,u2326,m150,HAIG,Who?
78202,L421402,u2340,m150,NIXON,A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
78203,L421401,u2326,m150,HAIG,About a dozen.
78204,L421393,u2340,m150,NIXON,For what?!
78205,L421392,u2326,m150,HAIG,"Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir."
78206,L421391,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ..."
78207,L421390,u2326,m150,HAIG,Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
78208,L421389,u2340,m150,NIXON,Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
78209,L421388,u2326,m150,HAIG,This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
78210,L421387,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
78211,L420785,u2340,m150,NIXON,"These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- ""T.R."" -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice."
78212,L420784,u2326,m150,HAIG,That's what they're doing.
78213,L420783,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?"
78214,L420155,u2340,m150,NIXON,"'Night, Al."
78215,L420154,u2326,m150,HAIG,I don't have a pistol.
78216,L420153,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room."
78217,L420152,u2326,m150,HAIG,"You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President."
78218,L420151,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President."
78219,L420150,u2326,m150,HAIG,"No, sir, you did not."
78220,L420148,u2326,m150,HAIG,"You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you."
78221,L420147,u2340,m150,NIXON,"There's no secrets here, Al."
78222,L420146,u2326,m150,HAIG,"May I say something, Mr. President?"
78223,L420145,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: ""Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!"" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon."
78224,L420144,u2326,m150,HAIG,At least Mitchell stood up to it.
78225,L420143,u2340,m150,NIXON,I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
78226,L420142,u2326,m150,HAIG,Mr. Hoover was a realist.
78227,L420141,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President."
78228,L420140,u2340,m150,NIXON,... go on.
78229,L420139,u2326,m150,HAIG,Sorry ...
78230,L420134,u2326,m150,HAIG,It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
78231,L420133,u2340,m150,NIXON,This is June twentieth?
78232,L421326,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Sir ... six bodies.
78233,L421325,u2340,m150,NIXON,... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
78234,L421324,u2340,m150,NIXON,No ...
78235,L421323,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"More light, chief?"
78236,L421240,u2340,m150,NIXON,"For God's sake, when does this end?!"
78237,L421239,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
78238,L421236,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ..."
78239,L421235,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
78240,L421234,u2340,m150,NIXON,I promised Iran to Townsend.
78241,L421233,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
78242,L421232,u2340,m150,NIXON,What about the documents he promised?
78243,L421231,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate."
78244,L421226,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"When I met with him, he said ..."
78245,L421225,u2340,m150,NIXON,How?
78246,L421224,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,We could leverage Helms.
78247,L421223,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's Helms -- it's got to be.
78248,L421222,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
78249,L421217,u2340,m150,NIXON,He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
78250,L421216,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again."
78251,L421202,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... worrying whether someone said something ""nice"" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ..."
78252,L421201,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ..."
78253,L421200,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ..."
78254,L421199,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American."
78255,L421198,u2340,m150,NIXON,Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
78256,L421197,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Because they're not Americans.
78257,L421174,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
78258,L421173,u2340,m150,NIXON,"My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?"
78259,L421172,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ..."
78260,L421166,u2340,m150,NIXON,This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
78261,L421165,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all."
78262,L421163,u2340,m150,NIXON,"The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ..."
78263,L421162,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Sir?
78264,L421161,u2340,m150,NIXON,... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
78265,L421160,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"I believe you're right, boss."
78266,L421159,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt."
78267,L421149,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Let him finish, Bob."
78268,L421148,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport."
78269,L421120,u2340,m150,NIXON,Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
78270,L421119,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"The blacks are lost, the ""schwartzes"" are gone ..."
78271,L421118,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks."
78272,L421117,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left."
78273,L421112,u2340,m150,NIXON,Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
78274,L421111,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great."
78275,L421031,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... ""The Beast.""  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of ""the Beast.""  She called it a wild animal."
78276,L421030,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Sir?
78277,L421029,u2340,m150,NIXON,"She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ..."
78278,L421028,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,What?
78279,L421027,u2340,m150,NIXON,"She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ..."
78280,L421026,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side."
78281,L421025,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"We really must go, Mr. President."
78282,L421013,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ..."
78283,L421012,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Mr. President!
78284,L420873,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority."
78285,L420872,u2340,m150,NIXON,"But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!"
78286,L420867,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's the parents' fault really.
78287,L420866,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts."
78288,L420865,u2340,m150,NIXON,"There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ..."
78289,L420864,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them."
78290,L420863,u2340,m150,NIXON,Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
78291,L420862,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Run 'em over.
78292,L420861,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?"
78293,L420860,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
78294,L420845,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to."
78295,L420844,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"... never complain, never explain, John ..."
78296,L420831,u2340,m150,NIXON,These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
78297,L420830,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Sir?
78298,L420829,u2340,m150,NIXON,Money.  Follow the money.
78299,L420828,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us."
78300,L420745,u2340,m150,NIXON,"They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass."
78301,L420744,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?"
78302,L420742,u2340,m150,NIXON,I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
78303,L420741,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,You never told him?
78304,L420740,u2340,m150,NIXON,... he'd just found out about Track 2.
78305,L420739,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of ""beast"" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ..."
78306,L420738,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?"
78307,L420737,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period."
78308,L420736,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?"
78309,L420735,u2340,m150,NIXON,"And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans."
78310,L420734,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Jesus!
78311,L420733,u2340,m150,NIXON,"He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt."
78312,L420732,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
78313,L420731,u2340,m150,NIXON,"The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election."
78314,L420730,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ..."
78315,L420729,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
78316,L420728,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba."
78317,L420727,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
78318,L420726,u2340,m150,NIXON,He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
78319,L420644,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!"
78320,L420643,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ..."
78321,L420440,u2340,m150,NIXON,No!
78322,L420439,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you."
78323,L420438,u2340,m150,NIXON,Where are they?
78324,L420343,u2340,m150,NIXON,The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
78325,L420342,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Meanwhile, what happens to the country?"
78326,L420330,u2340,m150,NIXON,... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
78327,L420329,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
78328,L420328,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ..."
78329,L420314,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
78330,L420313,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ..."
78331,L420301,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?"
78332,L420300,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do."
78333,L420299,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight."
78334,L420298,u2340,m150,NIXON,"This isn't a ""moral"" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary."
78335,L420297,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Sir?
78336,L420296,u2340,m150,NIXON,I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
78337,L420295,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls."
78338,L420294,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,How is this national security?
78339,L420293,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
78340,L420292,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice."
78341,L420291,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody."
78342,L420290,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
78343,L420289,u2340,m150,NIXON,Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
78344,L420288,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?"
78345,L420287,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Just do what I say, Bob."
78346,L420286,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
78347,L420285,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!"
78348,L420284,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,All right.
78349,L420283,u2340,m150,NIXON,"We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about."
78350,L420282,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?"
78351,L420281,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ..."
78352,L420280,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ..."
78353,L420279,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes."
78354,L420277,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this."
78355,L420276,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
78356,L420270,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
78357,L420269,u2340,m150,NIXON,"""National security priority restricted and controlled secret."""
78358,L420266,u2340,m150,NIXON,"""National Priority."""
78359,L420265,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
78360,L420264,u2340,m150,NIXON,"""Security"" is not strong enough."
78361,L420263,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's ""national security."""
78362,L420262,u2340,m150,NIXON,Silence!
78363,L420261,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,But what are we paying him for?
78364,L420253,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"What do you mean, sir?"
78365,L420252,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus."
78366,L420229,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
78367,L420228,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well, why not?"
78368,L420201,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,We were working on China.
78369,L420200,u2340,m150,NIXON,Fucking hell.
78370,L420199,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
78371,L420198,u2340,m150,NIXON,I did?
78372,L420197,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Yes, you approved it, sir."
78373,L420196,u2340,m150,NIXON,I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
78374,L420195,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature."
78375,L420194,u2340,m150,NIXON,"On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?"
78376,L420191,u2340,m150,NIXON,Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
78377,L420190,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
78378,L420181,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
78379,L420180,u2340,m150,NIXON,What's Liddy got?
78380,L420179,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the ""Plumbers"" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation."
78381,L420178,u2340,m150,NIXON,That fruitcake!  What about him?
78382,L420177,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
78383,L420163,u2340,m150,NIXON,Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
78384,L420162,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,"It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money."
78385,L420161,u2340,m150,NIXON,Their fourth!
78386,L420160,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
78387,L420159,u2340,m150,NIXON,But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
78388,L420158,u2327,m150,HALDEMAN,Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
78389,L420157,u2340,m150,NIXON,They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
78390,L420767,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next."
78391,L420766,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"What about happiness, Mother?"
78392,L420765,u2328,m150,HANNAH,It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
78393,L420764,u2342,m150,RICHARD,Did he have to die for me to get it?!
78394,L420763,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother."
78395,L420762,u2328,m150,HANNAH,Thou must.
78396,L420761,u2342,m150,RICHARD,I can't ...
78397,L420390,u2342,m150,RICHARD,Is it my turn?
78398,L420389,u2328,m150,HANNAH,We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
78399,L420386,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ..."
78400,L420385,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me."
78401,L420384,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise."
78402,L420383,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"I expect more from thee, Richard."
78403,L420382,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ..."
78404,L420381,u2328,m150,HANNAH,So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
78405,L420380,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry."
78406,L420379,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?"
78407,L420378,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke."
78408,L420377,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning."
78409,L420375,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse."
78410,L420374,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"Yes, Mother ..."
78411,L420373,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example."
78412,L420372,u2342,m150,RICHARD,Why me?
78413,L420371,u2328,m150,HANNAH,"Richard ... come with me, would you ..."
78414,L420759,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?"
78415,L420758,u2329,m150,HAROLD,"Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home."
78416,L420757,u2342,m150,RICHARD,Harold ... can I get you anything?
78417,L420756,u2329,m150,HAROLD,Mom expects great things from you ...
78418,L420755,u2329,m150,HAROLD,Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
78419,L420754,u2342,m150,RICHARD,What ... ?
78420,L420753,u2329,m150,HAROLD,Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
78421,L420369,u2329,m150,HAROLD,I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
78422,L420368,u2342,m150,RICHARD,"Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ..."
78423,L420367,u2329,m150,HAROLD,I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
78424,L420366,u2342,m150,RICHARD,What'd you say?
78425,L420365,u2329,m150,HAROLD,What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
78426,L420364,u2342,m150,RICHARD,What'd he say?
78427,L420948,u2330,m150,HELMS,"Black Irishman.  Very moving. ""Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity"" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- ""What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?"" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture."
78428,L420947,u2340,m150,NIXON,No.
78429,L420946,u2330,m150,HELMS,"You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  ""The Second Coming""?"
78430,L420945,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil."
78431,L420944,u2330,m150,HELMS,Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
78432,L420943,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?"
78433,L420942,u2330,m150,HELMS,So President Kennedy thought.
78434,L420941,u2340,m150,NIXON,Cuba would be a small price to pay.
78435,L420940,u2330,m150,HELMS,By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
78436,L420939,u2340,m150,NIXON,"But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century."
78437,L420938,u2330,m150,HELMS,"This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement."
78438,L420937,u2330,m150,HELMS,Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
78439,L420936,u2340,m150,NIXON,"CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago."
78440,L420935,u2330,m150,HELMS,... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
78441,L420934,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ..."
78442,L420933,u2330,m150,HELMS,It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
78443,L420932,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job."
78444,L420931,u2330,m150,HELMS,"My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know."
78445,L420930,u2340,m150,NIXON,Are you tapping Kissinger?
78446,L420929,u2330,m150,HELMS,I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
78447,L420928,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well, we'll lodge a formal protest."
78448,L420927,u2330,m150,HELMS,We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
78449,L420926,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yes.
78450,L420925,u2330,m150,HELMS,Mr. Castro.
78451,L420924,u2340,m150,NIXON,What?
78452,L420923,u2330,m150,HELMS,"It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue."
78453,L420922,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
78454,L420921,u2330,m150,HELMS,"And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time."
78455,L420920,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job."
78456,L420919,u2330,m150,HELMS,And me? ...
78457,L420918,u2340,m150,NIXON,The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
78458,L420917,u2330,m150,HELMS,Current levels may not be sufficient.
78459,L420916,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding."
78460,L420915,u2330,m150,HELMS,Not if I give you all the cards ...
78461,L420914,u2340,m150,NIXON,I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
78462,L420913,u2330,m150,HELMS,President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
78463,L420912,u2340,m150,NIXON,I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
78464,L420911,u2330,m150,HELMS,"Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick."
78465,L420908,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yes ...
78466,L420907,u2330,m150,HELMS,"You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President."
78467,L420906,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
78468,L420905,u2330,m150,HELMS,"Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?"
78469,L420904,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this."
78470,L420903,u2330,m150,HELMS,"I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ..."
78471,L420902,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them."
78472,L420901,u2330,m150,HELMS,"Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ..."
78473,L420900,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ..."
78474,L420899,u2330,m150,HELMS,"I suppose, ""Mister President,"" you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ..."
78475,L420897,u2330,m150,HELMS,"I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did."
78476,L420896,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?"
78477,L420895,u2330,m150,HELMS,"And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?"
78478,L420894,u2340,m150,NIXON,"My friends call me ""Mister President."""
78479,L420893,u2330,m150,HELMS,"I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last."
78480,L420714,u2331,m150,HOOVER,If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
78481,L420713,u2347,m150,TOLSON,Ummm...
78482,L420704,u2331,m150,HOOVER,Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
78483,L420703,u2347,m150,TOLSON,... little Bobby.
78484,L420684,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him."
78485,L420683,u2347,m150,TOLSON,"It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?"
78486,L420682,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power."
78487,L420681,u2347,m150,TOLSON,"Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen."
78488,L420680,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde."
78489,L420646,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip."
78490,L420645,u2347,m150,TOLSON,"What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?"
78491,L421049,u2331,m150,HOOVER,It won't.  As long as I'm here.
78492,L421048,u2340,m150,NIXON,"This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, ""If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself.""  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me."
78493,L421047,u2331,m150,HOOVER,No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
78494,L421046,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?"
78495,L421045,u2331,m150,HOOVER,I always get my man.
78496,L421044,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?"
78497,L421043,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late ""Doctor"" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press."
78498,L421042,u2340,m150,NIXON,Kissinger?
78499,L421041,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker."
78500,L421040,u2340,m150,NIXON,Who do you think is behind it?
78501,L421039,u2331,m150,HOOVER,That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
78502,L421038,u2340,m150,NIXON,We took his system out.
78503,L421037,u2331,m150,HOOVER,Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
78504,L421036,u2340,m150,NIXON,"We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office."
78505,L421035,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!"
78506,L421034,u2340,m150,NIXON,The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
78507,L421033,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: ""The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up.""  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them."
78508,L421032,u2340,m150,NIXON,"There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ..."
78509,L420725,u2340,m150,NIXON,The old queen did it on purpose.
78510,L420724,u2331,m150,HOOVER,You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
78511,L420723,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ..."
78512,L420716,u2331,m150,HOOVER,I know ...
78513,L420715,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home."
78514,L420712,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House."
78515,L420711,u2331,m150,HOOVER,You'll win the nomination.
78516,L420710,u2331,m150,HOOVER,I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
78517,L420709,u2340,m150,NIXON,I never met the man.
78518,L420708,u2331,m150,HOOVER,Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
78519,L420707,u2340,m150,NIXON,Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
78520,L420706,u2331,m150,HOOVER,I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
78521,L420705,u2340,m150,NIXON,Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
78522,L420702,u2340,m150,NIXON,You should ask Bobby.
78523,L420701,u2331,m150,HOOVER,How about you?  Are you going to win?
78524,L420700,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Oh, my goodness ..."
78525,L420698,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Actually, I've just had a bit of luck."
78526,L420697,u2340,m150,NIXON,Winning?
78527,L420696,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Thank you for coming, Dick."
78528,L420679,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin."
78529,L420678,u2340,m150,NIXON,"My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ..."
78530,L420673,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it."
78531,L420672,u2331,m150,HOOVER,"It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it."
78532,L421073,u2332,m150,HUNT,I won't tell him if you won't.
78533,L421072,u2346,m150,STURGIS,"So, does Tricky Dick know about this?"
78534,L421071,u2332,m150,HUNT,Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
78535,L421070,u2346,m150,STURGIS,Where'd you find him?
78536,L421066,u2332,m150,HUNT,A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
78537,L421065,u2346,m150,STURGIS,Who we working for?
78538,L421064,u2332,m150,HUNT,"We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak."
78539,L421063,u2346,m150,STURGIS,You're fucking me.
78540,L421062,u2332,m150,HUNT,The White House.
78541,L421061,u2346,m150,STURGIS,"Why, you got a customer?"
78542,L421060,u2346,m150,STURGIS,They're around.
78543,L421059,u2332,m150,HUNT,Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
78544,L421058,u2346,m150,STURGIS,How the fuck did you know?
78545,L420123,u2332,m150,HUNT,"Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States."
78546,L420122,u2335,m150,LIDDY,"Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard."
78547,L420121,u2332,m150,HUNT,"Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?"
78548,L420118,u2335,m150,LIDDY,"Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred."
78549,L420117,u2332,m150,HUNT,Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
78550,L420116,u2335,m150,LIDDY,"""A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk."" Nietzsche."
78551,L420115,u2332,m150,HUNT,Mein Kampf?
78552,L420114,u2332,m150,HUNT,Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
78553,L420113,u2335,m150,LIDDY,Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
78554,L421156,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen."
78555,L421155,u2333,m150,JONES,"Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?"
78556,L421154,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ..."
78557,L421151,u2340,m150,NIXON,The American people put me where I am.
78558,L421150,u2333,m150,JONES,"... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are."
78559,L421147,u2333,m150,JONES,I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
78560,L421146,u2340,m150,NIXON,"What do you mean, Jack?"
78561,L421145,u2333,m150,JONES,Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
78562,L421136,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change."
78563,L421135,u2333,m150,JONES,And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
78564,L421134,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold .."
78565,L421133,u2333,m150,JONES,"It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- ""detente"" with the Communists.  ""Detente"" -- it sounds like two fags dancing."
78566,L421132,u2333,m150,JONES,"Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, ""Mister President."""
78567,L421131,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support."
78568,L421130,u2333,m150,JONES,"So, what's this about, Dick?"
78569,L420575,u2340,m150,NIXON,Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
78570,L420574,u2333,m150,JONES,"That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of."
78571,L420573,u2340,m150,NIXON,Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
78572,L420572,u2333,m150,JONES,"Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60."
78573,L420571,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ..."
78574,L420569,u2340,m150,NIXON,Agreed.
78575,L420568,u2333,m150,JONES,"Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ..."
78576,L420544,u2333,m150,JONES,"He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ..."
78577,L420543,u2340,m150,NIXON,"By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ..."
78578,L420542,u2333,m150,JONES,Her name's Sandy ...
78579,L420541,u2340,m150,NIXON,She's quite pretty.
78580,L420540,u2333,m150,JONES,"I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party."
78581,L420538,u2333,m150,JONES,We'll see about that.
78582,L420537,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now."
78583,L420534,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ..."
78584,L420533,u2333,m150,JONES,"Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private ""thing,"" y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet."
78585,L420532,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party."
78586,L421522,u2340,m150,NIXON,Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
78587,L421521,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?"
78588,L421520,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you."
78589,L421519,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little."
78590,L421518,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
78591,L421517,u2340,m150,NIXON,Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
78592,L421516,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,You have many friends ... and admirers ...
78593,L421515,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry."
78594,L421514,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why."
78595,L421513,u2340,m150,NIXON,That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
78596,L421512,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries."
78597,L421511,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?"
78598,L421477,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Oh God, I'm going to throw up."
78599,L421476,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ..."
78600,L421475,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
78601,L421215,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yeah ...
78602,L421214,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far."
78603,L421213,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's."
78604,L421212,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ..."
78605,L421211,u2340,m150,NIXON,"That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry."
78606,L421208,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was."
78607,L421207,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
78608,L421206,u2340,m150,NIXON,"All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?"
78609,L421205,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
78610,L421204,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ..."
78611,L421116,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks."
78612,L421115,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
78613,L420847,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,We have to entertain the possibility ...
78614,L420846,u2340,m150,NIXON,"That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one."
78615,L420827,u2340,m150,NIXON,"This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ..."
78616,L420826,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret."
78617,L420825,u2340,m150,NIXON,"This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this."
78618,L420818,u2340,m150,NIXON,"That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!"
78619,L420817,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention."
78620,L420816,u2340,m150,NIXON,"That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen."
78621,L420811,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp ""realpolitik"" better than any of us, right, Henry?"
78622,L420810,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits."
78623,L420782,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the ""madman,"" Richard Nixon."
78624,L420781,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?"
78625,L420780,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this ""incursion.""  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ..."
78626,L420521,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime."
78627,L420520,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power."
78628,L420519,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- ""Six Crises"" sounds like a page from Churchill."
78629,L420518,u2340,m150,NIXON,... as the old alliances crumble.
78630,L420249,u2340,m150,NIXON,"We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your ""plumbers"" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!"
78631,L420248,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,There's no other choice.
78632,L420247,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!"
78633,L420226,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia."
78634,L420225,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ..."
78635,L420215,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs."
78636,L420214,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, Henry.  I don't."
78637,L420213,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ..."
78638,L420212,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
78639,L420211,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,I beg your pardon --
78640,L420210,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry."
78641,L420204,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad."
78642,L420203,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy."
78643,L421089,u2337,m150,MAO,How a fat man gets so many girls.
78644,L421088,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"Secret, Mr. Chairman?"
78645,L421087,u2337,m150,MAO,Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
78646,L421086,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman."
78647,L421085,u2337,m150,MAO,What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
78648,L421084,u2334,m150,KISSINGER,"You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class."
78649,L420993,u2340,m150,NIXON,How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
78650,L420992,u2336,m150,MANOLO,I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
78651,L420991,u2340,m150,NIXON,Why?
78652,L420990,u2336,m150,MANOLO,Yes.
78653,L420989,u2340,m150,NIXON,Did you cry when he died?
78654,L420988,u2336,m150,MANOLO,He was a politician.
78655,L420987,u2340,m150,NIXON,You don't think he was a hero?
78656,L420986,u2336,m150,MANOLO,That was Mr. Kennedy.
78657,L420985,u2340,m150,NIXON,"We let you down, didn't we.  Your people."
78658,L420984,u2336,m150,MANOLO,"Yes, Mr. President."
78659,L420983,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?"
78660,L420982,u2336,m150,MANOLO,Of course.
78661,L420981,u2340,m150,NIXON,Just ... uh ... you know.
78662,L420980,u2336,m150,MANOLO,"I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?"
78663,L421095,u2337,m150,MAO,The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
78664,L421094,u2340,m150,NIXON,Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
78665,L421093,u2337,m150,MAO,"You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese."
78666,L421092,u2340,m150,NIXON,I was the lesser of two evils.
78667,L421091,u2337,m150,MAO,"You know, I voted for you in your last election."
78668,L421083,u2337,m150,MAO,That has the added virtue of being true.
78669,L421082,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
78670,L421081,u2337,m150,MAO,Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
78671,L421079,u2340,m150,NIXON,We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
78672,L421078,u2337,m150,MAO,Looks can be deceiving ...
78673,L421077,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman."
78674,L421142,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ..."
78675,L421141,u2338,m150,MITCH,How about Kissinger along with him?
78676,L421140,u2340,m150,NIXON,"We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list."
78677,L421139,u2338,m150,MITCH,What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
78678,L421138,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Free, if you're the president."
78679,L421137,u2338,m150,MITCH,"So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?"
78680,L420581,u2340,m150,NIXON,I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
78681,L420580,u2338,m150,MITCH,"You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?"
78682,L420579,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics."
78683,L420858,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Sure, I'd like to offer condolences."
78684,L420857,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
78685,L420855,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,That was a long time ago.
78686,L420854,u2340,m150,NIXON,It broke my heart when Harold died.
78687,L420853,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you."
78688,L420852,u2340,m150,NIXON,"They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality."
78689,L420851,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked."
78690,L420850,u2340,m150,NIXON,"My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him."
78691,L420849,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,You all right?
78692,L420833,u2340,m150,NIXON,"How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?"
78693,L420832,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it."
78694,L420802,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon."
78695,L420801,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"One of the fathers was on the TV saying, ""My child was not a bum.""  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph."
78696,L420800,u2340,m150,NIXON,Jesus Christ!
78697,L420799,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
78698,L420798,u2340,m150,NIXON,How many?
78699,L420624,u2340,m150,NIXON,Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
78700,L420623,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes."
78701,L420622,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Uh, wait ..."
78702,L420529,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy."
78703,L420528,u2340,m150,NIXON,Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
78704,L420527,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,That'll be the day.
78705,L420526,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack."
78706,L420525,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
78707,L420524,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger."
78708,L420523,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
78709,L420522,u2340,m150,NIXON,Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
78710,L420485,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
78711,L420484,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?"
78712,L420483,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
78713,L420482,u2340,m150,NIXON,You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
78714,L420481,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy."
78715,L420244,u2340,m150,NIXON,"When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!"
78716,L420243,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
78717,L420242,u2340,m150,NIXON,"But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you."
78718,L420241,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,And Dick beat the shit out of them.
78719,L420240,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing."
78720,L420239,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,The lie?
78721,L420235,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: ""Until you talk you're all getting shot.""  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ..."
78722,L420234,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"It was illegal, what he did."
78723,L420220,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?"
78724,L420219,u2339,m150,MITCHELL,"We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ..."
78725,L420720,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?"
78726,L420719,u2347,m150,TOLSON,... Use his women.
78727,L420718,u2340,m150,NIXON,I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
78728,L420717,u2347,m150,TOLSON,... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
78729,L420695,u2347,m150,TOLSON,Mr. Nixon.
78730,L420694,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi."
78731,L420675,u2340,m150,NIXON,... but it was all we had.
78732,L420674,u2347,m150,TOLSON,But it was all we had.
78733,L420671,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ..."
78734,L420670,u2347,m150,TOLSON,"... give me a break, Mary."
78735,L421017,u2340,m150,NIXON,"But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ..."
78736,L421016,u2345,m150,STUDENT 2,"Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese."
78737,L421011,u2340,m150,NIXON,"That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ..."
78738,L421010,u2345,m150,STUDENT 2,"What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in."
78739,L421003,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy."
78740,L421002,u2345,m150,STUDENT 2,Ernie Davis.
78741,L421001,u2340,m150,NIXON,The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
78742,L421000,u2345,m150,STUDENT 2,Syracuse.
78743,L420999,u2340,m150,NIXON,Where you from?
78744,L420998,u2345,m150,STUDENT 2,You're shittin' me.
78745,L420997,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Hi, I'm Dick Nixon."
78746,L420567,u2340,m150,NIXON,She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
78747,L420566,u2344,m150,SANDY,"Yeah, she lives in Dallas ..."
78748,L420565,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Uh, is your mother ... still alive?"
78749,L420564,u2344,m150,SANDY,"... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ..."
78750,L420563,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Oh yeah, he's good."
78751,L420562,u2344,m150,SANDY,"Elvis I like, too."
78752,L420561,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
78753,L420560,u2344,m150,SANDY,I like jazz ...
78754,L420559,u2340,m150,NIXON,"What kind of, uh ... music do you like?"
78755,L420558,u2344,m150,SANDY,"Oh, I like satin, I like pink ..."
78756,L420557,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?"
78757,L420550,u2344,m150,SANDY,Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
78758,L420549,u2340,m150,NIXON,"That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ..."
78759,L420548,u2340,m150,NIXON,Hello ...
78760,L420547,u2344,m150,SANDY,Hi.
78761,L421024,u2340,m150,NIXON,Maybe I am.
78762,L421023,u2348,m150,YOUNG WOMAN,It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
78763,L421022,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good."
78764,L421021,u2348,m150,YOUNG WOMAN,Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
78765,L421020,u2340,m150,NIXON,There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
78766,L421019,u2348,m150,YOUNG WOMAN,"Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ..."
78767,L421015,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II."
78768,L421014,u2348,m150,YOUNG WOMAN,"No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?"
78769,L421005,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yes, I understand that."
78770,L421004,u2348,m150,YOUNG WOMAN,We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
78771,L421466,u2340,m150,NIXON,"... and get rid of all these ""goddamns"" and ""Jesus Christs""!"
78772,L421465,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,"Or we could write ""expletive deleted."""
78773,L421461,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,"Well, we could delete it."
78774,L421460,u2340,m150,NIXON,"And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. ""Niggers""!"
78775,L421429,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, ""Mea culpa, mea culpa,"" while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!"
78776,L421428,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,"No, sir ..."
78777,L421427,u2340,m150,NIXON,"There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?"
78778,L421416,u2340,m150,NIXON,Fire him.
78779,L421415,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,"Yes, yes."
78780,L421414,u2340,m150,NIXON,Of them.
78781,L421413,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,Sir?
78782,L421412,u2340,m150,NIXON,Proud?
78783,L421411,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,Compassionate.  Grateful.
78784,L421410,u2340,m150,NIXON,So I'm supposed to be ...
78785,L421409,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,POWs.  And their families.
78786,L421408,u2340,m150,NIXON,What's in there?
78787,L421407,u2340,m150,NIXON,"What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?"
78788,L421406,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,That's right.
78789,L421405,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ..."
78790,L421400,u2340,m150,NIXON,"They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?"
78791,L421399,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,Sir?
78792,L421398,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You know, Fred, they sell tickets."
78793,L421182,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good."
78794,L421181,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,Bernstein.
78795,L421126,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft."
78796,L421125,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,"No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move."
78797,L421123,u2340,m150,NIXON,The hell with 'em.
78798,L421122,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,"Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute."
78799,L420820,u2340,m150,NIXON,Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
78800,L420819,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
78801,L420813,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,"What?  Win Vietnam, sir?"
78802,L420812,u2340,m150,NIXON,"We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing."
78803,L420618,u2340,m150,NIXON,"And we got the ""big mo""!  We're back!"
78804,L420617,u2349,m150,ZIEGLER,We got the press this time!
78805,L421538,u2341,m150,PAT,There'll be time for that.
78806,L421537,u2340,m150,NIXON,No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
78807,L421536,u2341,m150,PAT,It'll be over soon.
78808,L421446,u2341,m150,PAT,No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
78809,L421445,u2340,m150,NIXON,They were for me.  They're mine.
78810,L421444,u2341,m150,PAT,And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
78811,L421442,u2340,m150,NIXON,You're drunk!
78812,L421441,u2341,m150,PAT,"I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ..."
78813,L421440,u2340,m150,NIXON,Don't be ridiculous!
78814,L421439,u2341,m150,PAT,"You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ..."
78815,L421437,u2341,m150,PAT,What matters to me is whether you understand it.
78816,L421436,u2340,m150,NIXON,You can't expect me to explain that to you.
78817,L421435,u2341,m150,PAT,Why didn't you?
78818,L421350,u2341,m150,PAT,"Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you."
78819,L421349,u2340,m150,NIXON,Thank you.
78820,L421348,u2341,m150,PAT,"No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying."
78821,L421345,u2340,m150,NIXON,Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
78822,L421344,u2341,m150,PAT,"I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ..."
78823,L421342,u2341,m150,PAT,"Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick."
78824,L421341,u2340,m150,NIXON,Hiding what?
78825,L421340,u2341,m150,PAT,I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
78826,L421339,u2340,m150,NIXON,And what am I doing?
78827,L421338,u2341,m150,PAT,You.  What' you're doing --
78828,L421337,u2340,m150,NIXON,"What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?"
78829,L421335,u2340,m150,NIXON,No.
78830,L421334,u2341,m150,PAT,"Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?"
78831,L421333,u2340,m150,NIXON,Tomorrow.
78832,L421332,u2341,m150,PAT,When?
78833,L421331,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yes.
78834,L421110,u2341,m150,PAT,It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
78835,L421109,u2340,m150,NIXON,Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
78836,L421104,u2340,m150,NIXON,How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
78837,L421103,u2341,m150,PAT,"Congratulations, Dick."
78838,L421101,u2341,m150,PAT,You're a long way from Whittier.
78839,L421100,u2340,m150,NIXON,Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
78840,L421099,u2341,m150,PAT,Penny for your thoughts.
78841,L420978,u2341,m150,PAT,"But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will."
78842,L420977,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ..."
78843,L420975,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy."
78844,L420974,u2341,m150,PAT,Sometimes I think that's what you want.
78845,L420973,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty."
78846,L420972,u2341,m150,PAT,You personally?
78847,L420971,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yes!
78848,L420970,u2341,m150,PAT,They're all your enemies?
78849,L420969,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down."
78850,L420968,u2341,m150,PAT,"Then what are you scared of, honey?"
78851,L420967,u2340,m150,NIXON,I do.  I do.  In my own way.
78852,L420966,u2341,m150,PAT,"No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?"
78853,L420965,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy."
78854,L420964,u2341,m150,PAT,"Yes, it's been a long time ..."
78855,L420963,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Yeah, sure, a long time ago."
78856,L420962,u2341,m150,PAT,"I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight."
78857,L420961,u2340,m150,NIXON,Because ... I have to relax.
78858,L420960,u2341,m150,PAT,Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
78859,L420959,u2340,m150,NIXON,Are you okay?
78860,L420958,u2341,m150,PAT,I've missed you.
78861,L420957,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?"
78862,L420952,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I asked him, ""Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?""  And he said, ""Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live."" ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?"
78863,L420951,u2341,m150,PAT,"He looked old, didn't he?"
78864,L420641,u2341,m150,PAT,Will you ... would you kiss me?
78865,L420640,u2340,m150,NIXON,Anything.
78866,L420639,u2341,m150,PAT,Can I just ask for one thing?
78867,L420638,u2340,m150,NIXON,"You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy."
78868,L420637,u2341,m150,PAT,Then I'll be there for you.
78869,L420636,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
78870,L420635,u2341,m150,PAT,And then you'll be happy?
78871,L420634,u2340,m150,NIXON,This.  Above all.
78872,L420633,u2341,m150,PAT,"Do you really want this, Dick?"
78873,L420632,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always."
78874,L420630,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy."
78875,L420629,u2341,m150,PAT,I don't want them to love me.
78876,L420628,u2340,m150,NIXON,"They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too."
78877,L420627,u2341,m150,PAT,"You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ..."
78878,L420626,u2340,m150,NIXON,Buddy? ...
78879,L420621,u2340,m150,NIXON,We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
78880,L420620,u2341,m150,PAT,Were you planning to tell me?
78881,L420596,u2341,m150,PAT,"They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick."
78882,L420595,u2340,m150,NIXON,No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
78883,L420594,u2341,m150,PAT,Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
78884,L420593,u2340,m150,NIXON,De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
78885,L420592,u2341,m150,PAT,You don't have to go.
78886,L420591,u2340,m150,NIXON,He doesn't want me at the funeral.
78887,L420590,u2341,m150,PAT,"Dick, you should call Bobby."
78888,L420437,u2340,m150,NIXON,I'll never run again.  I promise.
78889,L420436,u2341,m150,PAT,Is that the truth?
78890,L420435,u2340,m150,NIXON,Yeah ... I'm out.
78891,L420434,u2341,m150,PAT,Are you serious?
78892,L420433,u2340,m150,NIXON,I'll do it.  No more.
78893,L420432,u2340,m150,NIXON,If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
78894,L420431,u2341,m150,PAT,"We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I..."
78895,L420430,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?"
78896,L420429,u2341,m150,PAT,"Dick, don't..."
78897,L420427,u2341,m150,PAT,That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
78898,L420426,u2340,m150,NIXON,"This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together."
78899,L420425,u2341,m150,PAT,"No, I'm not!  I'm finished."
78900,L420424,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!"
78901,L420423,u2341,m150,PAT,"You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life."
78902,L420422,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It would ruin us, Buddy, our family."
78903,L420421,u2341,m150,PAT,The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
78904,L420420,u2340,m150,NIXON,My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
78905,L420419,u2341,m150,PAT,I want a divorce.
78906,L420418,u2340,m150,NIXON,What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
78907,L420416,u2341,m150,PAT,Not that.  Us.
78908,L420415,u2340,m150,NIXON,I'll concede in the morning.
78909,L420414,u2341,m150,PAT,"It's over, Dick."
78910,L420413,u2340,m150,NIXON,Amen to that.
78911,L420412,u2341,m150,PAT,No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
78912,L420411,u2340,m150,NIXON,Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
78913,L420407,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!"
78914,L420406,u2341,m150,PAT,I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
78915,L420405,u2340,m150,NIXON,"I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why."
78916,L420404,u2341,m150,PAT,"You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?"
78917,L420403,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Thank you, Fidel Castro."
78918,L420363,u2340,m150,NIXON,You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
78919,L420362,u2341,m150,PAT,"You're not a failure, Dick."
78920,L420361,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too."
78921,L420360,u2341,m150,PAT,It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
78922,L420359,u2340,m150,NIXON,What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
78923,L420358,u2341,m150,PAT,"We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick."
78924,L420357,u2340,m150,NIXON,"It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it."
78925,L420356,u2341,m150,PAT,It makes us human ...
78926,L420355,u2340,m150,NIXON,It's hard to lose ...
78927,L420354,u2341,m150,PAT,I know ...
78928,L420353,u2340,m150,NIXON,We lost ...
78929,L420517,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this ""crisis"" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it."
78930,L420516,u2340,m150,NIXON,"No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ..."
78931,L420515,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ..."
78932,L420514,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?"
78933,L420513,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Some say you are, Rocky."
78934,L420512,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
78935,L420511,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  ""Six Crises."""
78936,L420509,u2340,m150,NIXON,You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
78937,L420508,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,Whatcha mean by that?
78938,L420507,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ..."
78939,L420506,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ..."
78940,L420505,u2340,m150,NIXON,"""Checkers"" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy."
78941,L420504,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"The ""crises""?"
78942,L420503,u2340,m150,NIXON,What?
78943,L420502,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"Hiya, fellow ... What were they?"
78944,L420501,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it ""Six Crises.""  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write."
78945,L420500,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,To what?
78946,L420499,u2340,m150,NIXON,But being out of the game gives me time to write.
78947,L420498,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"Someday, Dick."
78948,L420497,u2340,m150,NIXON,Lost.
78949,L420496,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,Won or lost?
78950,L420495,u2340,m150,NIXON,Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
78951,L420494,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?"
78952,L420493,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy."
78953,L420492,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,"Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him."
78954,L420491,u2340,m150,NIXON,"Well enough.  You're looking ""happy,"" Nelson."
78955,L420490,u2343,m150,ROCKEFELLER,Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
78956,L422325,u2355,m151,ELLIS,You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
78957,L422324,u2350,m151,BELL,I'm... discouraged.
78958,L422323,u2355,m151,ELLIS,You're discouraged.
78959,L422322,u2350,m151,BELL,Most don't.
78960,L422321,u2355,m151,ELLIS,...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
78961,L422320,u2355,m151,ELLIS,Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
78962,L422319,u2350,m151,BELL,"No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it."

Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
78966,L422314,u2350,m151,BELL,Yes I do.
78967,L422313,u2355,m151,ELLIS,You don't know what he thinks.
78968,L422312,u2350,m151,BELL,...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
78969,L422311,u2350,m151,BELL,I don't know. I feel overmatched.
78970,L422310,u2355,m151,ELLIS,How come're you doin that?

78972,L422308,u2355,m151,ELLIS,...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
78973,L422307,u2355,m151,ELLIS,All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
78974,L422306,u2350,m151,BELL,I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
78975,L422305,u2355,m151,ELLIS,I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
78976,L422304,u2350,m151,BELL,What would you a done if he'd been released?

78999,L422279,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
79000,L422278,u2350,m151,BELL,Hard to believe.
79001,L422277,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,"That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel."
79002,L422276,u2350,m151,BELL,"Yes, he has some hard bark on him."
79003,L422275,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.

79007,L422271,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,Well what would you call him.
79008,L422270,u2350,m151,BELL,I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
79009,L422269,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,"He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom."
79010,L422268,u2350,m151,BELL,Uh-huh.
79011,L422267,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,None of that explains your man though.

79015,L422263,u2350,m151,BELL,Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
79016,L422262,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
79017,L422261,u2350,m151,BELL,Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.

79020,L422258,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,"It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?"
79021,L422257,u2350,m151,BELL,I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
79022,L422256,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.

79024,L422252,u2364,m151,ROSCOE,Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...

79045,L422046,u2350,m151,BELL,It's not me he's in trouble with.
79046,L422045,u2351,m151,CARLA JEAN,"Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you."

79139,L422376,u2350,m151,BELL,"Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night."

79338,L421686,u2352,m151,CHIGURH,Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.

79391,L421632,u2352,m151,CHIGURH,Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
79392,L421631,u2363,m151,PROPRIETOR,With anything?
79393,L421630,u2352,m151,CHIGURH,With what?

79397,L421625,u2352,m151,CHIGURH,I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.

79531,L421993,u2365,m151,WELLS,I don't think that's how I would describe him.
79532,L421992,u2360,m151,MOSS,"What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?"
79533,L421991,u2365,m151,WELLS,...But that won't last.
79534,L421989,u2360,m151,MOSS,"I know, I've seen him. Sort of."
79535,L421988,u2365,m151,WELLS,...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
79536,L422142,u2360,m151,MOSS,Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
79537,L422141,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,What outfit.
79538,L422140,u2360,m151,MOSS,Yes sir. Two tours.
79539,L422139,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,Nam?
79540,L422138,u2360,m151,MOSS,No sir. I'm a veteran.
79541,L422137,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,Are you in the service?
79542,L422136,u2360,m151,MOSS,Yes sir.
79543,L422135,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,Don't jack with me.
79544,L422134,u2360,m151,MOSS,No sir.
79545,L422133,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,Are you jackin' with me?
79546,L422132,u2360,m151,MOSS,I got an overcoat on.
79547,L422131,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
79548,L422130,u2360,m151,MOSS,No sir.
79549,L422129,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
79550,L422128,u2360,m151,MOSS,I don't know.
79551,L422127,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,That is correct. And how do I decide?
79552,L422126,u2360,m151,MOSS,"You do, I reckon."
79553,L422125,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
79554,L422124,u2360,m151,MOSS,I don't know. American citizens.
79555,L422123,u2362,m151,OFFICIAL,Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
79556,L423659,u2375,m152,DOCTOR,"Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them..."
79557,L423658,u2368,m152,BALLARD,No... Friends from the diner maybe?
79558,L423657,u2375,m152,DOCTOR,"I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?"
79559,L423656,u2368,m152,BALLARD,Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
79560,L423649,u2368,m152,BALLARD,So she did witness it?
79561,L423648,u2375,m152,DOCTOR,It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
79562,L423647,u2368,m152,BALLARD,Could I have that in American?
79563,L423646,u2375,m152,DOCTOR,She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
79564,L423645,u2368,m152,BALLARD,How is she?
79565,L424469,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about..."
79566,L424468,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Sheriff, I don't..."
79567,L423718,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
79568,L423717,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?"
79569,L423716,u2369,m152,BETTY,"IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!"
79570,L423715,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?"
79571,L423714,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
79572,L423344,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks."
79573,L423343,u2369,m152,BETTY,...I meant your food.
79574,L423342,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe."
79575,L423341,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?"
79576,L424554,u2387,m152,ROY,"I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there."
79577,L424553,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best..."
79578,L424552,u2387,m152,ROY,"You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait..."
79579,L424549,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"You gotta go, we're pinned down!"
79580,L424548,u2387,m152,ROY,I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
79581,L424547,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you."
79582,L424538,u2387,m152,ROY,"YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water."
79583,L424537,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!"
79584,L424504,u2387,m152,ROY,"-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --"
79585,L424503,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!"
79586,L424502,u2387,m152,ROY,That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
79587,L424248,u2387,m152,ROY,I know plenty.
79588,L424247,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?"
79589,L424246,u2387,m152,ROY,"Little place called ""Williams,"" why?"
79590,L424245,u2368,m152,BALLARD,Any idea where it is?
79591,L424244,u2387,m152,ROY,What about it?
79592,L424243,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?"
79593,L424242,u2387,m152,ROY,"Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?"
79594,L424241,u2368,m152,BALLARD,That's a nice name for what you need...
79595,L424240,u2387,m152,ROY,"Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!"
79596,L424091,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"No, I didn't have to."
79597,L424090,u2387,m152,ROY,Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
79598,L424089,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here."
79599,L424088,u2387,m152,ROY,"Well, do something, then, damnit!"
79600,L424087,u2368,m152,BALLARD,I know that...
79601,L424086,u2387,m152,ROY,"Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!"
79602,L423867,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"She said she was in Arizona, did she?"
79603,L423866,u2387,m152,ROY,"Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona."
79604,L423863,u2387,m152,ROY,Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
79605,L423862,u2368,m152,BALLARD,Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
79606,L423860,u2387,m152,ROY,Tell him what you told me.
79607,L423859,u2368,m152,BALLARD,Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
79608,L423858,u2387,m152,ROY,I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
79609,L423855,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?"
79610,L423854,u2387,m152,ROY,We think we know where Betty is.
79611,L423853,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?"
79612,L423728,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this."
79613,L423727,u2387,m152,ROY,"That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!"
79614,L423726,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen..."
79615,L423725,u2387,m152,ROY,You're lying!
79616,L423724,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her."
79617,L423723,u2387,m152,ROY,What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
79618,L423655,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"That's right, you have the right to remain silent."
79619,L423654,u2387,m152,ROY,"One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!"
79620,L423653,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!"
79621,L423652,u2387,m152,ROY,"Oww, the arm, the arm!"
79622,L423651,u2368,m152,BALLARD,That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
79623,L423650,u2387,m152,ROY,"Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden."
79624,L423644,u2368,m152,BALLARD,'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
79625,L423643,u2387,m152,ROY,So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
79626,L423642,u2368,m152,BALLARD,A woman can write a check.
79627,L423641,u2387,m152,ROY,You said a woman couldn't have done it.
79628,L423640,u2368,m152,BALLARD,So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
79629,L423639,u2387,m152,ROY,"Anyway, so what?"
79630,L423638,u2368,m152,BALLARD,Junior year!
79631,L423637,u2387,m152,ROY,"...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe..."
79632,L423636,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift..."
79633,L423635,u2387,m152,ROY,Yeah?
79634,L423634,u2368,m152,BALLARD,I questioned Joyce about all this...
79635,L423614,u2387,m152,ROY,You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
79636,L423613,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work..."
79637,L423612,u2387,m152,ROY,Bad idea...
79638,L423611,u2368,m152,BALLARD,You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
79639,L423610,u2387,m152,ROY,Did you send anyone out there?
79640,L423609,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate."
79641,L423608,u2387,m152,ROY,"So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?"
79642,L423606,u2368,m152,BALLARD,You think a woman did that?!
79643,L423605,u2387,m152,ROY,Jesus...
79644,L423604,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!"
79645,L423603,u2387,m152,ROY,Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
79646,L423602,u2368,m152,BALLARD,It wasn't a woman.
79647,L423601,u2387,m152,ROY,"She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman."
79648,L423600,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's..."
79649,L423599,u2387,m152,ROY,"No, Elden, I need to..."
79650,L423598,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!"
79651,L423597,u2387,m152,ROY,"I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was..."
79652,L423596,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!"
79653,L423595,u2387,m152,ROY,"No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out."
79654,L423594,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?"
79655,L423593,u2387,m152,ROY,"Oww! My arm, careful!"
79656,L423592,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet."
79657,L423354,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway..."
79658,L423353,u2387,m152,ROY,"Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?"
79659,L423352,u2368,m152,BALLARD,...plenty
79660,L423351,u2387,m152,ROY,"They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?"
79661,L423350,u2368,m152,BALLARD,Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
79662,L423348,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty."
79663,L423347,u2387,m152,ROY,You should get the order you want.
79664,L423346,u2368,m152,BALLARD,It's fine. Mind your own meal...
79665,L423345,u2387,m152,ROY,I thought you said the eggs weren't...
79666,L423340,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty..."
79667,L423339,u2387,m152,ROY,"You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds..."
79668,L423338,u2368,m152,BALLARD,"Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of ""church bake sales"" in perspective..."
79669,L423413,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels."
79670,L423412,u2369,m152,BETTY,"'Kay, good. Bye, then..."
79671,L423411,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright..."
79672,L423410,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?"
79673,L423409,u2382,m152,JOYCE,You must be joking.
79674,L423408,u2369,m152,BETTY,They're fine... you miss it?
79675,L423407,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?"
79676,L423406,u2369,m152,BETTY,Oh. How come?
79677,L423405,u2382,m152,JOYCE,Great. Good. Content...
79678,L423404,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, I was just... How you doing?"
79679,L423403,u2382,m152,JOYCE,Need something else?
79680,L423401,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"You know, flags and shit... he said ""for a livelier look"" or something."
79681,L423400,u2369,m152,BETTY,"""Banners?"""
79682,L423399,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back."
79683,L424570,u2369,m152,BETTY,I don't think I am.
79684,L424569,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?"
79685,L424568,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but..."
79686,L424567,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
79687,L424566,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think."
79688,L424565,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
79689,L424564,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword."
79690,L424563,u2369,m152,BETTY,...what're you saying?
79691,L424562,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out."
79692,L424561,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'd rather not...
79693,L424560,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back."
79694,L424559,u2369,m152,BETTY,This is really awkward...
79695,L424558,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me."
79696,L424557,u2369,m152,BETTY,I better go check on them.
79697,L424556,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
79698,L424544,u2369,m152,BETTY,"WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!"
79699,L424543,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
79700,L424542,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'm sorry.
79701,L424541,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,That's my son! My son is dead!
79702,L424528,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now..."
79703,L424527,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something."
79704,L424526,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think."
79705,L424525,u2369,m152,BETTY,I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
79706,L424524,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... ""If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends."" Now that's beautiful."
79707,L424523,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am."
79708,L424522,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together."
79709,L424521,u2369,m152,BETTY,"""Thirty-two?"""
79710,L424520,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language."
79711,L424519,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Umm, I don't think that..."
79712,L424518,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen."
79713,L424517,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it."
79714,L424516,u2369,m152,BETTY,I am?
79715,L424515,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different."
79716,L424496,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,...to see you.
79717,L424495,u2369,m152,BETTY,"...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?"
79718,L424494,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it."
79719,L424493,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs."
79720,L424492,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?"
79721,L424491,u2369,m152,BETTY,I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
79722,L424490,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?"
79723,L424489,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband..."
79724,L424488,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Do you know why I'm here?
79725,L424487,u2369,m152,BETTY,...I... I know what you are.
79726,L424486,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Do you know who I am?
79727,L424485,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute."
79728,L424484,u2369,m152,BETTY,...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
79729,L424477,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Oh, this is wonderful..."
79730,L424476,u2369,m152,BETTY,"This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together..."
79731,L424475,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Who are these idiots?
79732,L423945,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,"Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done."
79733,L423944,u2369,m152,BETTY,Umm... yes. Back home.
79734,L423943,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
79735,L423942,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,"Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine..."
79736,L423941,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Yes, ma'am."
79737,L423940,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
79738,L423898,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
79739,L423897,u2369,m152,BETTY,"It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background..."
79740,L423896,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,...I don't think I know that hospital.
79741,L423895,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista."
79742,L423894,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,"Well, I certainly would have heard about that."
79743,L423893,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up."
79744,L423892,u2372,m152,CHIEF NURSE,"Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here..."
79745,L423794,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
79746,L423793,u2369,m152,BETTY,I gotta go.
79747,L423792,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,Do what?
79748,L423791,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this."
79749,L423790,u2369,m152,BETTY,What are you talking about?
79750,L423789,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?"
79751,L423788,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?"
79752,L423787,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
79753,L423669,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me..."
79754,L423668,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine."
79755,L423667,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?"
79756,L423666,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Well, you are."
79757,L423665,u2369,m152,BETTY,All the time...
79758,L423664,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
79759,L423663,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit."
79760,L423662,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose."
79761,L423661,u2369,m152,BETTY,Are you and Larry happy?
79762,L423660,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Let me know if you need anything, okay?"
79763,L423437,u2369,m152,BETTY,I gotta go make dinner.
79764,L423436,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday..."
79765,L423435,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Yeah, me too."
79766,L423434,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!"
79767,L423433,u2369,m152,BETTY,"He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it."
79768,L423432,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,What?
79769,L423431,u2369,m152,BETTY,Maroon.  I stole it.
79770,L423430,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,The LeSabre!
79771,L423429,u2369,m152,BETTY,What?
79772,L423428,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,Aahhh...  So what color is it?
79773,L423427,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year..."
79774,L423426,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,You sure? Maybe next week we could...
79775,L423425,u2369,m152,BETTY,It's all right.
79776,L423424,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon."
79777,L423423,u2369,m152,BETTY,No... what about your sister?
79778,L423422,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast."
79779,L423421,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
79780,L423420,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Oh, Betty --"
79781,L423419,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!"
79782,L423418,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort..."
79783,L423417,u2369,m152,BETTY,Did you watch it yet?
79784,L424594,u2369,m152,BETTY,...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
79785,L424593,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Thanks...
79786,L424592,u2369,m152,BETTY,...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
79787,L424591,u2379,m152,GEORGE,George...
79788,L424590,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord..."
79789,L424589,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I have... did it sound that bad?
79790,L424588,u2369,m152,BETTY,Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
79791,L424587,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?"
79792,L424586,u2369,m152,BETTY,My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
79793,L424585,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Oh. Of course... sorry.
79794,L424392,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry."
79795,L424391,u2379,m152,GEORGE,You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
79796,L424390,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't..."
79797,L424389,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!"
79798,L424386,u2379,m152,GEORGE,...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
79799,L424385,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!"
79800,L424382,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!"
79801,L424381,u2369,m152,BETTY,"David, please --"
79802,L424380,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
79803,L424379,u2369,m152,BETTY,What do you mean? What did I do to you...
79804,L424378,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot."
79805,L424369,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
79806,L424368,u2369,m152,BETTY,Why are you doing this to me?
79807,L424367,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here."
79808,L424366,u2369,m152,BETTY,"David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?"
79809,L424355,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show."
79810,L424354,u2369,m152,BETTY,Ad lib?
79811,L424353,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib."
79812,L424325,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Yes... maybe it was.
79813,L424324,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?"
79814,L424323,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?..."
79815,L424322,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise..."
79816,L424321,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
79817,L424320,u2369,m152,BETTY,"...but I love listening to you, so that's okay..."
79818,L424319,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, ""Me, me, me."" It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here..."
79819,L424318,u2369,m152,BETTY,"It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something..."
79820,L424317,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"No, I mean your dedication scares me..."
79821,L424316,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I know, that's why we were meant to be together..."
79822,L424315,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"I've never met anyone like you, Betty."
79823,L424314,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?..."
79824,L424313,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Didn't I?
79825,L424312,u2369,m152,BETTY,You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
79826,L424310,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place."
79827,L424309,u2369,m152,BETTY,"She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?"
79828,L424308,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I don't think your friend likes me.
79829,L424223,u2369,m152,BETTY,I know. It's up to us.
79830,L424222,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me."
79831,L424221,u2369,m152,BETTY,Of course.
79832,L424220,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?"
79833,L424219,u2369,m152,BETTY,I just want everything to be perfect between us.
79834,L424218,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv..."
79835,L424217,u2369,m152,BETTY,"For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at ""Skies,"" a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year."
79836,L424216,u2379,m152,GEORGE,What happened when you were twelve?
79837,L424215,u2369,m152,BETTY,I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
79838,L424214,u2369,m152,BETTY,You told me that two hours ago.
79839,L424213,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago."
79840,L424212,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up..."
79841,L424211,u2379,m152,GEORGE,She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
79842,L424210,u2369,m152,BETTY,"She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me."
79843,L424209,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Yes, she is."
79844,L424208,u2369,m152,BETTY,Lyla's very nice.
79845,L424184,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"You're late, Eric."
79846,L424183,u2369,m152,BETTY,Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
79847,L424182,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain."
79848,L424181,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you..."
79849,L424159,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
79850,L424158,u2369,m152,BETTY,Why do they keep calling you George?
79851,L424155,u2369,m152,BETTY,I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
79852,L424154,u2379,m152,GEORGE,You never gave us a chance...
79853,L424153,u2369,m152,BETTY,There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
79854,L424152,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?"
79855,L424148,u2369,m152,BETTY,He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
79856,L424147,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one."
79857,L424146,u2369,m152,BETTY,You knew Del?!
79858,L424145,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything."
79859,L424144,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, Del."
79860,L424143,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Oh, you mean Fred."
79861,L424129,u2369,m152,BETTY,"The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --"
79862,L424128,u2379,m152,GEORGE,That's very kind of you.
79863,L424127,u2369,m152,BETTY,But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
79864,L424126,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I beg your pardon?
79865,L424124,u2369,m152,BETTY,We were engaged.
79866,L424123,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I take it I should. I'm sorry.
79867,L424122,u2369,m152,BETTY,...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
79868,L424416,u2374,m152,DEL,"You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are."
79869,L424415,u2369,m152,BETTY,I don't know.
79870,L424414,u2374,m152,DEL,"That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?"
79871,L424413,u2369,m152,BETTY,It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
79872,L424412,u2374,m152,DEL,"You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?"
79873,L424411,u2369,m152,BETTY,I came for love...
79874,L424410,u2374,m152,DEL,"Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?"
79875,L423458,u2374,m152,DEL,That is a skill!
79876,L423457,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?"
79877,L423456,u2374,m152,DEL,It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
79878,L423454,u2374,m152,DEL,They're new to us...
79879,L423453,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new."
79880,L423452,u2374,m152,DEL,And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
79881,L423451,u2374,m152,DEL,Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
79882,L423450,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?"
79883,L423449,u2374,m152,DEL,"...well, then you ain't got much."
79884,L423448,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I got you, Del..."
79885,L423447,u2374,m152,DEL,"Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?"
79886,L423446,u2369,m152,BETTY,Or the vitamins? Or the...?
79887,L423445,u2374,m152,DEL,What?
79888,L423444,u2369,m152,BETTY,...like the water purifiers?
79889,L423443,u2374,m152,DEL,"All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential."
79890,L423442,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax."
79891,L423441,u2374,m152,DEL,She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
79892,L423440,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but..."
79893,L423439,u2374,m152,DEL,"No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?"
79894,L423438,u2369,m152,BETTY,Sure you don't want any salad?
79895,L423396,u2374,m152,DEL,"Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home."
79896,L423395,u2369,m152,BETTY,What was that?
79897,L423393,u2374,m152,DEL,What's so special about it?
79898,L423392,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --"
79899,L423391,u2374,m152,DEL,I ran back in to get the phone.
79900,L423390,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath."
79901,L423389,u2374,m152,DEL,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?"
79902,L423388,u2369,m152,BETTY,"So, call me when you --"
79903,L424471,u2369,m152,BETTY,"It's not really a good time, guys..."
79904,L424470,u2387,m152,ROY,"Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be..."
79905,L424466,u2387,m152,ROY,"I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped."
79906,L424465,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Ahh, look, right now's not very..."
79907,L424464,u2387,m152,ROY,You're in serious danger!
79908,L424463,u2369,m152,BETTY,Roy! What are you doing here?
79909,L424462,u2387,m152,ROY,"Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!"
79910,L423588,u2369,m152,BETTY,It was Chloe...
79911,L423587,u2387,m152,ROY,You did? Was it anyone that you...?
79912,L423586,u2369,m152,BETTY,Yes.
79913,L423585,u2387,m152,ROY,My God... did you get a look at who did it?
79914,L423584,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!"
79915,L423583,u2387,m152,ROY,"Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened..."
79916,L423582,u2369,m152,BETTY,"What're you doing here, Roy?"
79917,L423581,u2369,m152,BETTY,You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
79918,L423580,u2387,m152,ROY,Uh-huh.
79919,L423579,u2369,m152,BETTY,Make sure it's elevated...
79920,L423578,u2387,m152,ROY,"Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few..."
79921,L423577,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?"
79922,L423576,u2387,m152,ROY,"Hey, Betty. Are you okay?"
79923,L423337,u2387,m152,ROY,"Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to..."
79924,L423336,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning..."
79925,L423335,u2387,m152,ROY,"Hi, Betty. You're looking good..."
79926,L423834,u2369,m152,BETTY,"To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me..."
79927,L423833,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you..."
79928,L423832,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it."
79929,L423831,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived..."
79930,L423830,u2369,m152,BETTY,You made out alright.
79931,L423829,u2378,m152,ELLEN,Worse.
79932,L423828,u2369,m152,BETTY,Like Rome?
79933,L423827,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?"
79934,L423826,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'll go to the Hospital.
79935,L423825,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?"
79936,L423823,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon."
79937,L423822,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"You mean... George McCord, the actor?"
79938,L423821,u2369,m152,BETTY,Dr. David Ravell.
79939,L423820,u2378,m152,ELLEN,What's his real name?
79940,L423819,u2369,m152,BETTY,How did you know?
79941,L423818,u2378,m152,ELLEN,I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
79942,L423817,u2369,m152,BETTY,No. Loma Vista.
79943,L423816,u2378,m152,ELLEN,Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
79944,L423815,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good..."
79945,L423814,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas..."
79946,L423813,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop..."
79947,L423812,u2378,m152,ELLEN,Really?
79948,L423811,u2369,m152,BETTY,I left my husband two days ago.
79949,L423810,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me."
79950,L423809,u2369,m152,BETTY,That's horrible!
79951,L423808,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --"
79952,L423807,u2378,m152,ELLEN,Sure I loved it! It was great.
79953,L423806,u2369,m152,BETTY,Did you love it?
79954,L423805,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in ""Roman Holiday,"" and goddamnit, I went."
79955,L423804,u2369,m152,BETTY,Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
79956,L423803,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy."
79957,L423802,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Los Angeles, California."
79958,L423801,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"Where you headed, Betty?"
79959,L423800,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any."
79960,L423799,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'd slap his face.
79961,L423798,u2378,m152,ELLEN,If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
79962,L423786,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess."
79963,L423785,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"Shut up, Merle... Williams."
79964,L423778,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it..."
79965,L423777,u2378,m152,ELLEN,"So you're into ""Reason,"" too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?"
79966,L423776,u2378,m152,ELLEN,He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
79967,L423775,u2369,m152,BETTY,I begged him to let me put that on!
79968,L423774,u2378,m152,ELLEN,What's the matter here?
79969,L424388,u2369,m152,BETTY,...did I win some contest?
79970,L424387,u2384,m152,LYLA,"She called you 'George,' George."
79971,L424139,u2369,m152,BETTY,I married a car salesman.
79972,L424138,u2384,m152,LYLA,"No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?"
79973,L424137,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --"
79974,L424133,u2384,m152,LYLA,I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
79975,L424132,u2369,m152,BETTY,Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
79976,L424131,u2384,m152,LYLA,"I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?"
79977,L424456,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did."
79978,L424455,u2386,m152,ROSA,"These guys are here to help you, Betty."
79979,L424435,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise."
79980,L424434,u2369,m152,BETTY,"There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God..."
79981,L424433,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this..."
79982,L424432,u2369,m152,BETTY,I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
79983,L424431,u2386,m152,ROSA,What?! That you had something to do with it?
79984,L424429,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there..."
79985,L424428,u2386,m152,ROSA,Your husband?!
79986,L424427,u2369,m152,BETTY,"You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh..."
79987,L424426,u2386,m152,ROSA,"What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on..."
79988,L424425,u2369,m152,BETTY,I have to leave now.
79989,L424424,u2386,m152,ROSA,Where are you going?
79990,L424423,u2369,m152,BETTY,"...this is your sweater, right?"
79991,L424422,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
79992,L424421,u2386,m152,ROSA,What are you doing?
79993,L424307,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George."
79994,L424306,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!"
79995,L424305,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Rosa, so you've met David?"
79996,L424301,u2369,m152,BETTY,"All the time. It's always ""Loma Vista"" this, ""Loma Vista"" that."
79997,L424300,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?"
79998,L424299,u2369,m152,BETTY,You should have a little faith in people.
79999,L424298,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?"
80000,L424297,u2369,m152,BETTY,Rosa...
80001,L424296,u2386,m152,ROSA,"No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral..."
80002,L424295,u2369,m152,BETTY,Are you sure I can borrow this?
80003,L424239,u2386,m152,ROSA,"But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind..."
80004,L424238,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, almost never."
80005,L424237,u2386,m152,ROSA,"This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?"
80006,L424236,u2386,m152,ROSA,"I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools."
80007,L424235,u2369,m152,BETTY,Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
80008,L424234,u2386,m152,ROSA,Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
80009,L424233,u2369,m152,BETTY,To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
80010,L424232,u2386,m152,ROSA,"No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?"
80011,L424231,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know..."
80012,L424230,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?"
80013,L424229,u2369,m152,BETTY,He is real.
80014,L424228,u2386,m152,ROSA,Does he know you think he's real?
80015,L424227,u2386,m152,ROSA,You still in love?
80016,L424226,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Oh, God! You scared me! Yes..."
80017,L424225,u2386,m152,ROSA,Were you with him this whole time?
80018,L424118,u2386,m152,ROSA,You never know who you'll see.
80019,L424117,u2369,m152,BETTY,Looking for someone?
80020,L424101,u2369,m152,BETTY,Umm...
80021,L424100,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with..."
80022,L424099,u2369,m152,BETTY,What are those for?
80023,L424098,u2369,m152,BETTY,...okay.
80024,L424097,u2386,m152,ROSA,So what do you say? Can we be friends?
80025,L424096,u2386,m152,ROSA,"This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid."
80026,L424095,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break."
80027,L424070,u2369,m152,BETTY,Fine.
80028,L424069,u2386,m152,ROSA,"I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can."
80029,L424067,u2369,m152,BETTY,HE IS REAL!!
80030,L424066,u2386,m152,ROSA,"I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!"
80031,L424065,u2369,m152,BETTY,Why'd you help me in the first place?
80032,L424063,u2386,m152,ROSA,"IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!"
80033,L424062,u2369,m152,BETTY,"If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?"
80034,L424061,u2386,m152,ROSA,"I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you."
80035,L424060,u2369,m152,BETTY,Shhh! I heard you the first time.
80036,L424059,u2386,m152,ROSA,I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
80037,L424058,u2369,m152,BETTY,I have no idea what you're talking about.
80038,L424057,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!"
80039,L424056,u2386,m152,ROSA,"ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!"
80040,L424055,u2369,m152,BETTY,What? Where was he?!
80041,L424054,u2386,m152,ROSA,Doctor David Ravell.
80042,L424053,u2369,m152,BETTY,Who?
80043,L424052,u2386,m152,ROSA,Guess who I saw today.
80044,L424022,u2386,m152,ROSA,I was talking about what you could wear!
80045,L424021,u2369,m152,BETTY,"You said in L.A., anything goes."
80046,L424020,u2386,m152,ROSA,Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
80047,L424019,u2369,m152,BETTY,How many men have I talked to?
80048,L424018,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  ""Please call if you have any information on David Ravell."" This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?"
80049,L424017,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you."
80050,L424016,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should."
80051,L424015,u2369,m152,BETTY,"David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm..."
80052,L424014,u2386,m152,ROSA,"...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission."
80053,L424013,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy..."
80054,L424012,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia..."
80055,L424011,u2386,m152,ROSA,Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
80056,L424010,u2369,m152,BETTY,It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
80057,L424009,u2386,m152,ROSA,"God, that's awful!"
80058,L424008,u2369,m152,BETTY,Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
80059,L424007,u2386,m152,ROSA,He has a wife?!
80060,L424006,u2369,m152,BETTY,"I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife."
80061,L424005,u2386,m152,ROSA,"What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit."
80062,L424004,u2369,m152,BETTY,"You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place."
80063,L424003,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'"
80064,L424002,u2386,m152,ROSA,"You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?"
80065,L424001,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?"
80066,L424000,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?"
80067,L423999,u2386,m152,ROSA,Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
80068,L423998,u2369,m152,BETTY,The Five?
80069,L423997,u2386,m152,ROSA,Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
80070,L423996,u2369,m152,BETTY,"Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County..."
80071,L423975,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits."
80072,L423974,u2369,m152,BETTY,Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
80073,L423973,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat..."
80074,L423972,u2369,m152,BETTY,It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
80075,L423971,u2386,m152,ROSA,"No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street..."
80076,L423970,u2369,m152,BETTY,The one you were telling me about?
80077,L423969,u2386,m152,ROSA,I got this apartment with a guy.
80078,L423967,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?"
80079,L423966,u2369,m152,BETTY,"No, that's not, I couldn't..."
80080,L423965,u2386,m152,ROSA,You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
80081,L423962,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Man, that is love."
80082,L423961,u2369,m152,BETTY,No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
80083,L423960,u2386,m152,ROSA,"'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?"
80084,L423959,u2369,m152,BETTY,It's something I had to do. For David.
80085,L423956,u2369,m152,BETTY,I came for love. My fianc is here.
80086,L423955,u2386,m152,ROSA,So why'd you come to L.A.?
80087,L423954,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
80088,L423953,u2386,m152,ROSA,You don't sound like you're from here.
80089,L423917,u2369,m152,BETTY,"LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!"
80090,L423916,u2386,m152,ROSA,ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
80091,L423915,u2369,m152,BETTY,I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
80092,L423914,u2386,m152,ROSA,You're hurting him!!
80093,L423913,u2369,m152,BETTY,He has no heartbeat!
80094,L423912,u2386,m152,ROSA,What are you doing?
80095,L423362,u2370,m152,BLAKE,"No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
80096,L423361,u2383,m152,LONNIE,"I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake."
80097,L423360,u2370,m152,BLAKE,"Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?"
80098,L423359,u2383,m152,LONNIE,Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
80099,L423358,u2370,m152,BLAKE,"We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie."
80100,L423357,u2383,m152,LONNIE,"Blake, I can handle that transplant!"
80101,L424401,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Good.
80102,L424400,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No, that should be more than --"
80103,L424399,u2379,m152,GEORGE,More than you know. Is there anything else?
80104,L424398,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
80105,L424397,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake."
80106,L424396,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Deranged. That would be the right word.
80107,L424395,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty..."
80108,L424394,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
80109,L423689,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
80110,L423688,u2376,m152,DUANE,"Really. And where was that, old man?"
80111,L423687,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?"
80112,L423686,u2376,m152,DUANE,"He goin' crazy on us, or what?"
80113,L423685,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
80114,L423684,u2376,m152,DUANE,The fuck you talking about?
80115,L423683,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book."
80116,L423682,u2376,m152,DUANE,Huh?
80117,L423681,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory."
80118,L423680,u2376,m152,DUANE,"Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot."
80119,L423677,u2376,m152,DUANE,"Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen."
80120,L423676,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?"
80121,L423534,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,...and put them in your mouth.
80122,L423533,u2374,m152,DEL,"Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God."
80123,L423530,u2374,m152,DEL,My socks?
80124,L423529,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?"
80125,L423528,u2374,m152,DEL,I... I don't know...
80126,L423527,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken."
80127,L423526,u2374,m152,DEL,Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
80128,L423525,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Like what?
80129,L423524,u2374,m152,DEL,"The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things."
80130,L423523,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You did not just say ""Injuns,"" Del."
80131,L423515,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Hmmmm. ""Five Stars,"" huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?"
80132,L423514,u2374,m152,DEL,"All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?"
80133,L423511,u2374,m152,DEL,"Are we gonna do business here, or not?"
80134,L423510,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it."
80135,L423509,u2374,m152,DEL,No...
80136,L423508,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?"
80137,L423507,u2374,m152,DEL,I don't follow...
80138,L423506,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
80139,L423505,u2374,m152,DEL,Of what?
80140,L423504,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Could you give us an example?
80141,L423501,u2374,m152,DEL,"It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks."
80142,L423500,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,What do you mean?
80143,L423497,u2374,m152,DEL,Are you kidding me? What's to like?
80144,L423496,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?"
80145,L423495,u2374,m152,DEL,Fine. You got five...
80146,L423494,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes."
80147,L423491,u2374,m152,DEL,You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
80148,L423490,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,If we're for real?
80149,L423489,u2374,m152,DEL,"All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real."
80150,L423484,u2374,m152,DEL,Ahh... my wife's.
80151,L423483,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
80152,L423482,u2374,m152,DEL,"Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup."
80153,L423481,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Oh, yes, with the coffee..."
80154,L423480,u2374,m152,DEL,If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
80155,L423472,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
80156,L423471,u2374,m152,DEL,"...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em."
80157,L424459,u2389,m152,WESLEY,What's wrong with you?
80158,L424458,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
80159,L424448,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed."
80160,L424447,u2389,m152,WESLEY,It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
80161,L424446,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --"
80162,L424445,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?"
80163,L424444,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out."
80164,L424443,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
80165,L424442,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?"
80166,L424440,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Well, you were right about what that bartender said."
80167,L424439,u2389,m152,WESLEY,You were right. Del wasn't lying.
80168,L424340,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,You made your point...  I was wrong.
80169,L424339,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest..."
80170,L424338,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I said 'got it?'
80171,L424337,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Man, you have got to get some therapy."
80172,L424336,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?"
80173,L424335,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
80174,L424334,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a..."
80175,L424333,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind..."
80176,L424332,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
80177,L424331,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
80178,L424330,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,It just didn't fit her profile...
80179,L424329,u2389,m152,WESLEY,What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
80180,L424328,u2389,m152,WESLEY,A doctor on the show... why?
80181,L424327,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Who's this?
80182,L424281,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"""It's beneath her..."" She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!"
80183,L424280,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Wesley...
80184,L424279,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
80185,L424278,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,You need to remember who you're talking to...
80186,L424277,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
80187,L424276,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
80188,L424275,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?"
80189,L424274,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I never said that I believed...
80190,L424273,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman..."
80191,L424272,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,What doesn't?
80192,L424271,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense."
80193,L424270,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we..."
80194,L424269,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure..."
80195,L424268,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her."
80196,L424267,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Well... I think I saw her soul.
80197,L424266,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,So you believed the bartender. Why?
80198,L424192,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!..."
80199,L424191,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
80200,L424175,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
80201,L424174,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,What?
80202,L424173,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I'm not telling.
80203,L424172,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Where? Where is she?
80204,L424171,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway."
80205,L424114,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional."
80206,L424113,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
80207,L424112,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
80208,L424111,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"""When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral...""  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?"
80209,L424110,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"I said, 'No.' N-O."
80210,L424109,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty."
80211,L424108,u2389,m152,WESLEY,No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
80212,L424107,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
80213,L424106,u2389,m152,WESLEY,No.
80214,L424105,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"It's a very moving experience, trust me."
80215,L424104,u2389,m152,WESLEY,We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
80216,L424103,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,We should go.
80217,L424038,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?"
80218,L424037,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"You know, blonde, thin, whatever..."
80219,L424036,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,How'd they describe her?
80220,L424031,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it."
80221,L424030,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
80222,L424029,u2389,m152,WESLEY,What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
80223,L424027,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
80224,L424026,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,That was a really shitty thing to do.
80225,L424025,u2389,m152,WESLEY,What the hell's the matter with you?
80226,L424024,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me."
80227,L423989,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!"
80228,L423988,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Worse... you're in Texas.
80229,L423987,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!"
80230,L423986,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
80231,L423985,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I know that.
80232,L423984,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!"
80233,L423983,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That ""make a statement,"" do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!"
80234,L423982,u2389,m152,WESLEY,They paid us half. They still owe us half...
80235,L423981,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,What?
80236,L423980,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Half.
80237,L423979,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do."
80238,L423938,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise..."
80239,L423937,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch..."
80240,L423934,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
80241,L423933,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long."
80242,L423927,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You're always so coarse... ""Do her right here."" Let's just see what happens, okay?  ""I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."""
80243,L423926,u2389,m152,WESLEY,And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
80244,L423925,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable."
80245,L423924,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?"
80246,L423880,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?"
80247,L423879,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive..."
80248,L423852,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary."
80249,L423851,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Like... us?
80250,L423850,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night."
80251,L423849,u2389,m152,WESLEY,So what the fuck's a Finn?
80252,L423848,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Betty, Betty, Betty..."
80253,L423847,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg."
80254,L423846,u2389,m152,WESLEY,A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
80255,L423845,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn."
80256,L423841,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was."
80257,L423840,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?"
80258,L423839,u2389,m152,WESLEY,...among others.
80259,L423838,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Joyce was screwing Del.
80260,L423837,u2389,m152,WESLEY,You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
80261,L423836,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
80262,L423737,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone."
80263,L423736,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I hope you're right...
80264,L423735,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
80265,L423734,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
80266,L423730,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?"
80267,L423729,u2389,m152,WESLEY,So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
80268,L423709,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
80269,L423708,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck."
80270,L423707,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"What the hell was that, another statement?"
80271,L423702,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Wait. Any last words, General Lee?"
80272,L423701,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Should I kill him now?
80273,L423700,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
80274,L423695,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him."
80275,L423694,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond."
80276,L423679,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts."
80277,L423678,u2389,m152,WESLEY,We can live with that.
80278,L423674,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together."
80279,L423673,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals."
80280,L423629,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make."
80281,L423628,u2389,m152,WESLEY,...that's a good motto.
80282,L423627,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead."
80283,L423626,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I wanted to make a statement.
80284,L423625,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up."
80285,L423624,u2389,m152,WESLEY,You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
80286,L423623,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,It's not here. Let's go.
80287,L423622,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
80288,L423621,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?"
80289,L423620,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?"
80290,L423619,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out..."
80291,L423618,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,What 'look'?
80292,L423617,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I didn't. You gave me a look!
80293,L423616,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts."
80294,L423615,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
80295,L423570,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
80296,L423569,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Well, why'd you shoot him?"
80297,L423568,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"We don't know which Buick, do we?"
80298,L423567,u2389,m152,WESLEY,He told us it's in the Buick.
80299,L423566,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
80300,L423565,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?"
80301,L423564,u2389,m152,WESLEY,You told me how to do it!
80302,L423563,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
80303,L423560,u2389,m152,WESLEY,IT SURE IS!!
80304,L423559,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?"
80305,L423549,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"A mark, huh?"
80306,L423548,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off."
80307,L423546,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels."
80308,L423545,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Hell of a way to die.
80309,L423544,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped."
80310,L423542,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?"
80311,L423541,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Now, that's really stupid."
80312,L423540,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?"
80313,L423539,u2389,m152,WESLEY,That is so right.
80314,L423538,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy."
80315,L423537,u2389,m152,WESLEY,That's right.
80316,L423517,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
80317,L423516,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better."
80318,L423513,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
80319,L423512,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Relax, we brought the cash."
80320,L423479,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
80321,L423478,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Hey... you got a fine one right here!
80322,L423476,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Beer, please."
80323,L423475,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Bourbon, little water, thank you."
80324,L423884,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore."
80325,L423883,u2377,m152,ELIZABETH,"If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me."
80326,L423882,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,What do you mean?
80327,L423881,u2377,m152,ELIZABETH,"I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry."
80328,L423875,u2377,m152,ELIZABETH,Betty was a lovely child.
80329,L423874,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Very graceful. Perfect form.
80330,L423873,u2377,m152,ELIZABETH,This is Betty at twelve.
80331,L423759,u2373,m152,DARLENE,...who doesn't?
80332,L423758,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
80333,L423757,u2373,m152,DARLENE,"If it helps bring her back, be my guest..."
80334,L423756,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,I see.  May I?
80335,L423755,u2373,m152,DARLENE,"No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this..."
80336,L423754,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,"But she wanted more out of life, right?"
80337,L423753,u2373,m152,DARLENE,"Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile."
80338,L423752,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,Hmm... you two in high school together?
80339,L423751,u2373,m152,DARLENE,"Oh, five years, give or take."
80340,L423750,u2371,m152,CHARLIE,...and how long did she work here?
80341,L423522,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"""Injuns?"""
80342,L423521,u2374,m152,DEL,"Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid."
80343,L423520,u2389,m152,WESLEY,He's waiting...
80344,L423519,u2374,m152,DEL,Jesus Christ!
80345,L423503,u2374,m152,DEL,You better believe it.
80346,L423502,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Really?
80347,L423499,u2374,m152,DEL,"It is, if you like idiots..."
80348,L423498,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Seems like a nice place.
80349,L423493,u2374,m152,DEL,"Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up."
80350,L423492,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Isn't that the point?
80351,L423486,u2374,m152,DEL,"Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction..."
80352,L423485,u2389,m152,WESLEY,What'd you get her?
80353,L424580,u2384,m152,LYLA,Then do as you're told. Get her back.
80354,L424579,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot."
80355,L424578,u2379,m152,GEORGE,That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
80356,L424577,u2384,m152,LYLA,Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
80357,L424576,u2379,m152,GEORGE,What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
80358,L424575,u2384,m152,LYLA,You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
80359,L424574,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
80360,L424573,u2384,m152,LYLA,"This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months."
80361,L424377,u2384,m152,LYLA,I SAID FORGET IT!
80362,L424376,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!"
80363,L424373,u2379,m152,GEORGE,No! Let me try this!
80364,L424372,u2384,m152,LYLA,"All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!"
80365,L424371,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!"
80366,L424370,u2384,m152,LYLA,"Is there a problem, George?"
80367,L424365,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --"
80368,L424364,u2384,m152,LYLA,What the hell's going on?
80369,L424363,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it..."
80370,L424265,u2379,m152,GEORGE,...yeah.
80371,L424264,u2384,m152,LYLA,"""Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?"" Remember?"
80372,L424263,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Hmm?
80373,L424262,u2384,m152,LYLA,"Actually, she was my discovery... just like you."
80374,L424261,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery."
80375,L424260,u2384,m152,LYLA,I said I'll think about it.
80376,L424259,u2379,m152,GEORGE,It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
80377,L424258,u2384,m152,LYLA,I'll think about it.
80378,L424257,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
80379,L424256,u2384,m152,LYLA,"I don't know, George..."
80380,L424255,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens."
80381,L424254,u2384,m152,LYLA,"No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?"
80382,L424253,u2379,m152,GEORGE,Can I have an evil twin?
80383,L424252,u2384,m152,LYLA,We know that...
80384,L424251,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla."
80385,L424250,u2384,m152,LYLA,"I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good."
80386,L424249,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on ""Reason"". It was a totally rejuvenating experience."
80387,L424162,u2384,m152,LYLA,"Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do..."
80388,L424161,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come."
80389,L424150,u2379,m152,GEORGE,I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
80390,L424149,u2384,m152,LYLA,"Funny, that's just what I was thinking..."
80391,L424136,u2384,m152,LYLA,"Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, ""Betty""?"
80392,L424135,u2379,m152,GEORGE,"No, wait... what happened next, Betty?"
80393,L424134,u2384,m152,LYLA,"Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?"
80394,L424292,u2380,m152,GUARD,Sure.
80395,L424291,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?"
80396,L424290,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Oh fuck...
80397,L424289,u2380,m152,GUARD,Better.
80398,L424288,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?"
80399,L424287,u2380,m152,GUARD,Uh-huh.
80400,L424286,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Yeah? The sport utility?
80401,L424285,u2380,m152,GUARD,"Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black."
80402,L424284,u2389,m152,WESLEY,...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
80403,L423888,u2389,m152,WESLEY,What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
80404,L423887,u2381,m152,JERROLD,"Because it ain't natural, young man."
80405,L423886,u2389,m152,WESLEY,...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
80406,L423885,u2381,m152,JERROLD,You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
80407,L423878,u2381,m152,JERROLD,"Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school."
80408,L423877,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Would you say she was ambitious?
80409,L423876,u2381,m152,JERROLD,"And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died..."
80410,L424084,u2382,m152,JOYCE,Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
80411,L424083,u2387,m152,ROY,"Yeah. Why, you know him?"
80412,L424082,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?"
80413,L424081,u2387,m152,ROY,The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
80414,L424080,u2382,m152,JOYCE,What did you say?
80415,L424079,u2387,m152,ROY,"Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here..."
80416,L424078,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway."
80417,L424077,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight..."
80418,L424076,u2387,m152,ROY,"Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college."
80419,L424075,u2382,m152,JOYCE,No... before that.
80420,L424074,u2387,m152,ROY,You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
80421,L424073,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too."
80422,L424072,u2387,m152,ROY,"Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case."
80423,L424071,u2382,m152,JOYCE,"You're wastin' your time, Roy."
80424,L424093,u2386,m152,ROSA,"Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air."
80425,L424092,u2385,m152,MERCEDES,Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
80426,L424051,u2385,m152,MERCEDES,"Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on ""A Reason to Love?"""
80427,L424050,u2386,m152,ROSA,I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
80428,L424049,u2385,m152,MERCEDES,"God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?"
80429,L424048,u2386,m152,ROSA,David Ravell.
80430,L424047,u2385,m152,MERCEDES,Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
80431,L424046,u2386,m152,ROSA,She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
80432,L424045,u2385,m152,MERCEDES,So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
80433,L424044,u2386,m152,ROSA,Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
80434,L424043,u2385,m152,MERCEDES,So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
80435,L424042,u2386,m152,ROSA,Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
80436,L424041,u2385,m152,MERCEDES,What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
80437,L424512,u2387,m152,ROY,I swear to God!
80438,L424511,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"You lie, motherfucker..."
80439,L424510,u2387,m152,ROY,She's a lesbian.
80440,L424509,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
80441,L424508,u2387,m152,ROY,Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
80442,L424507,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Did Chloe crack?
80443,L424506,u2387,m152,ROY,I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
80444,L424505,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!"
80445,L424169,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her."
80446,L424168,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell."
80447,L424167,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
80448,L424166,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Huh?
80449,L424165,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,Mr. Campbell?
80450,L424164,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Yeah?
80451,L423749,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?"
80452,L423748,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around..."
80453,L423747,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I see.  Did Chloe testify?
80454,L423746,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"""A Reason to Love."""
80455,L423745,u2389,m152,WESLEY,Her show?
80456,L423744,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
80457,L423743,u2389,m152,WESLEY,I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
80458,L423742,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it..."
80459,L423741,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?"
80460,L423740,u2388,m152,SUE ANN,"I wish I could help you, but I can't."
80461,L423739,u2389,m152,WESLEY,"Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore."
80462,L426158,u2390,m153,BIG DAN,"No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial."
80463,L426157,u2394,m153,EVERETT,I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
80464,L426151,u2390,m153,BIG DAN,And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
80465,L426150,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Our pleasure, Big Dan."
80466,L426149,u2390,m153,BIG DAN,Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
80467,L426133,u2390,m153,BIG DAN,"Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?"
80468,L426132,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?"
80469,L426131,u2390,m153,BIG DAN,I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
80470,L426489,u2391,m153,COOLEY,The law. Well the law is a human institution.
80471,L426488,u2394,m153,EVERETT,It ain't the law!
80472,L426482,u2394,m153,EVERETT,You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
80473,L426481,u2391,m153,COOLEY,- and share one of your graves.
80474,L426480,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Hang on there -
80475,L426479,u2391,m153,COOLEY,"Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -"
80476,L426478,u2394,m153,EVERETT,You can't do this -
80477,L426477,u2391,m153,COOLEY,"You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys."
80478,L426476,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Waitaminute -
80479,L426475,u2391,m153,COOLEY,- but now it deposits you here.
80480,L426474,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Waitaminute -
80481,L426473,u2391,m153,COOLEY,"End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -"
80482,L426493,u2401,m153,PETE,"Good Lord, what do we do?"
80483,L426492,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy."
80484,L426326,u2401,m153,PETE,Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
80485,L426325,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Huh?!
80486,L426324,u2401,m153,PETE,"Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure."
80487,L426323,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
80488,L426322,u2401,m153,PETE,"No, they never did turn me into a toad."
80489,L426321,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad."
80490,L426280,u2401,m153,PETE,Do not seek the treasure!
80491,L426279,u2392,m153,DELMAR,...Pete?
80492,L426005,u2401,m153,PETE,"What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?"
80493,L426004,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land."
80494,L425992,u2401,m153,PETE,"Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn."
80495,L425991,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
80496,L425975,u2401,m153,PETE,All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
80497,L425974,u2392,m153,DELMAR,That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
80498,L425973,u2401,m153,PETE,That's right!
80499,L425911,u2401,m153,PETE,You mis'able little sneak thief...
80500,L425910,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?"
80501,L425903,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Gopher, Everett?"
80502,L425902,u2401,m153,PETE,We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
80503,L425840,u2401,m153,PETE,"How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?"
80504,L425839,u2392,m153,DELMAR,'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
80505,L426500,u2392,m153,DELMAR,That ain't it!
80506,L426499,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley."
80507,L426498,u2392,m153,DELMAR,A miracle! It was a miracle!
80508,L426464,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -"
80509,L426463,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett."
80510,L426452,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?"
80511,L426451,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs."
80512,L426447,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Oh, okay."
80513,L426446,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak."
80514,L426445,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"What sat mean exactly, Everett?"
80515,L426403,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Everett, my beard itches."
80516,L426402,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
80517,L426396,u2394,m153,EVERETT,He was never turned into a frog!
80518,L426395,u2392,m153,DELMAR,'N turned into a frog -
80519,L426354,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Oh my God!
80520,L426353,u2394,m153,EVERETT,It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
80521,L426346,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!"
80522,L426345,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
80523,L426339,u2394,m153,EVERETT,I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
80524,L426338,u2392,m153,DELMAR,So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
80525,L426274,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the..."
80526,L426273,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias."
80527,L426272,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!"
80528,L426271,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that."
80529,L426270,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?"
80530,L426269,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Okay, Everett."
80531,L426268,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!"
80532,L426192,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Not that I'm aware.
80533,L426191,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Pete have a brother?
80534,L426135,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well."
80535,L426134,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Uh, we uh-"
80536,L426122,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
80537,L426121,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him."
80538,L426120,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!"
80539,L426117,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
80540,L426116,u2394,m153,EVERETT,...I'm not sure that's Pete.
80541,L426113,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
80542,L426112,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!"
80543,L426109,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!"
80544,L426108,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Whuhh...
80545,L426073,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson."
80546,L426072,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
80547,L426021,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
80548,L426020,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Yeah, look at me."
80549,L426016,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Where's Tommy?
80550,L426015,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!"
80551,L426014,u2394,m153,EVERETT,I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
80552,L426013,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
80553,L426000,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?"
80554,L425999,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Izzat right?
80555,L425998,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Four hundred, Delmar."
80556,L425997,u2392,m153,DELMAR,Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
80557,L425954,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?"
80558,L425953,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett."
80559,L425945,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift."
80560,L425944,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-"
80561,L425941,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none."
80562,L425940,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed."
80563,L425939,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!"
80564,L425935,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!"
80565,L425934,u2394,m153,EVERETT,I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
80566,L425933,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!"
80567,L425932,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
80568,L425931,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!"
80569,L425898,u2394,m153,EVERETT,And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
80570,L425897,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Gopher, Everett?"
80571,L425896,u2394,m153,EVERETT,...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
80572,L425874,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett."
80573,L425873,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!"
80574,L425871,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Fire! I hate fire!
80575,L425870,u2392,m153,DELMAR,"What do we do now, Everett?"
80576,L425825,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-"
80577,L425824,u2392,m153,DELMAR,How'd he know about the treasure?
80578,L426391,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
80579,L426390,u2399,m153,PAPPY,You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
80580,L426384,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Campaign manager? Waldrip.
80581,L426383,u2399,m153,PAPPY,What's his name again?
80582,L426375,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Assa good idea, Pappy."
80583,L426374,u2399,m153,PAPPY,I'm sayin' we har this man away.
80584,L426302,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Problem a p'seption.
80585,L426301,u2399,m153,PAPPY,"Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past."
80586,L426147,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Okay, Pappy."
80587,L426146,u2399,m153,PAPPY,"I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!"
80588,L425988,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Oh, yes, assa parful new force."
80589,L425987,u2399,m153,PAPPY,"We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!"
80590,L426418,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -"
80591,L426417,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,"Not out the other side his face, though."
80592,L426416,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
80593,L426386,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Vernon T. Waldrip.
80594,L426385,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Vernon Waldrip.
80595,L426382,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Powas p'suasion.
80596,L426381,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
80597,L426380,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
80598,L426379,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Enticements a power, wealth, settera."
80599,L426378,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,"Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's."
80600,L426377,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Cain't beat 'em, join 'em."
80601,L426376,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Helluva idea.
80602,L426312,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Wipin' little circles with his bread...
80603,L426311,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Pullin' ah pants down...
80604,L426310,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation."
80605,L426309,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,"Well, that's how I characterize it."
80606,L426308,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Well now, I don't believe assa property scription."
80607,L426307,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,"No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it."
80608,L426306,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
80609,L426305,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
80610,L426304,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
80611,L426303,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Ass right.
80612,L426297,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Helluva awgazation.
80613,L426296,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Devil his due.
80614,L426295,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,"Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot."
80615,L426294,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Suckin' away.
80616,L426293,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Wipin' little circles with his bread.
80617,L426292,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Latch right on to that tit.

80619,L426290,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Gonna pluck us off the tit.
80620,L426289,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
80621,L426288,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Them straw polls is ugly.
80622,L425984,u2393,m153,ECKARD,"Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point."
80623,L425983,u2403,m153,SPIVEY,In any state.
80624,L425982,u2393,m153,ECKARD,Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
80625,L426536,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well sure, honey, but..."
80626,L426535,u2400,m153,PENNY,"I counted to three, honey."
80627,L426533,u2400,m153,PENNY,That wasn't my doing...
80628,L426532,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Yes, but honey -"
80629,L426531,u2400,m153,PENNY,I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
80630,L426530,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey."
80631,L426529,u2400,m153,PENNY,Uh-huh.
80632,L426528,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake."
80633,L426527,u2400,m153,PENNY,"Well, we need that ring."
80634,L426526,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well, I'm sorry honey -"
80635,L426525,u2400,m153,PENNY,Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
80636,L426524,u2394,m153,EVERETT,You -
80637,L426523,u2400,m153,PENNY,"Or, it might a been under the mattress."
80638,L426522,u2394,m153,EVERETT,You said -
80639,L426521,u2400,m153,PENNY,I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
80640,L426520,u2394,m153,EVERETT,You said it was in the rolltop desk!
80641,L426519,u2400,m153,PENNY,That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
80642,L426518,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Not your...
80643,L426517,u2400,m153,PENNY,That's not my ring.
80644,L426516,u2394,m153,EVERETT,- in the gods - Huh?
80645,L426515,u2400,m153,PENNY,That's not my ring.
80646,L426514,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -"
80647,L426513,u2400,m153,PENNY,"That's good, honey."
80648,L426512,u2394,m153,EVERETT,...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
80649,L426511,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end..."
80650,L426510,u2400,m153,PENNY,"That's right, honey."
80651,L426509,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"All's well that ends well, as the poet says."
80652,L426462,u2400,m153,PENNY,No weddin'.
80653,L426461,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"It's just a symbol, honey -"
80654,L426460,u2400,m153,PENNY,Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
80655,L426459,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -"
80656,L426458,u2400,m153,PENNY,We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
80657,L426457,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap."
80658,L426456,u2400,m153,PENNY,I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
80659,L426455,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Where's your ring, honey?"
80660,L426454,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings."
80661,L426453,u2400,m153,PENNY,"McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned."
80662,L426262,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!"
80663,L426261,u2400,m153,PENNY,I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
80664,L426260,u2394,m153,EVERETT,I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
80665,L426259,u2400,m153,PENNY,No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
80666,L426258,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Now Penny, stop that!"
80667,L426257,u2400,m153,PENNY,"That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train."
80668,L426504,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state..."
80669,L426503,u2401,m153,PETE,That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
80670,L426502,u2394,m153,EVERETT,It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
80671,L426501,u2401,m153,PETE,We prayed to God and he pitied us!
80672,L426405,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!"
80673,L426404,u2401,m153,PETE,This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
80674,L426394,u2401,m153,PETE,"Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -"
80675,L426393,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-"
80676,L426351,u2401,m153,PETE,Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
80677,L426350,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Pete... I do apologize.
80678,L426344,u2401,m153,PETE,"...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old."
80679,L426343,u2394,m153,EVERETT,I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
80680,L426342,u2401,m153,PETE,...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
80681,L426341,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!"
80682,L426340,u2401,m153,PETE,But...
80683,L426337,u2401,m153,PETE,But... but...
80684,L426336,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Fact of the matter - there never was!
80685,L426334,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well, but Pete..."
80686,L426333,u2401,m153,PETE,"I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!"
80687,L426332,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing..."
80688,L426329,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Aw, that's all right."
80689,L426328,u2401,m153,PETE,"It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts."
80690,L426320,u2394,m153,EVERETT,I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
80691,L426319,u2401,m153,PETE,"They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty."
80692,L426318,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
80693,L426317,u2401,m153,PETE,It was a moment a weakness!
80694,L426029,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh..."
80695,L426028,u2401,m153,PETE,"...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of..."
80696,L426026,u2401,m153,PETE,"Isn't it, uh..."
80697,L426025,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be..."
80698,L426019,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope."
80699,L426018,u2401,m153,PETE,"The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!"
80700,L426007,u2401,m153,PETE,Well that hardly sounds like you...
80701,L426006,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really."
80702,L426003,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?"
80703,L426002,u2401,m153,PETE,An' all my meals for free...
80704,L425996,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Million point two.
80705,L425995,u2401,m153,PETE,A million dollars.
80706,L425943,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
80707,L425942,u2401,m153,PETE,"Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade."
80708,L425938,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar."
80709,L425937,u2401,m153,PETE,The preacher said it absolved us.
80710,L425930,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Pete, don't be ignorant-"
80711,L425929,u2401,m153,PETE,"Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!"
80712,L425917,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?"
80713,L425916,u2401,m153,PETE,That don't make no sense!
80714,L425915,u2394,m153,EVERETT,So I borrowed it till I did know!
80715,L425914,u2401,m153,PETE,You didn't know that at the time!
80716,L425913,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Who was fixing to betray us!
80717,L425909,u2394,m153,EVERETT,It was in his bureau.
80718,L425908,u2401,m153,PETE,To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
80719,L425907,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
80720,L425906,u2401,m153,PETE,How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
80721,L425901,u2401,m153,PETE,"We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!"
80722,L425900,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Don't I know it.
80723,L425899,u2401,m153,PETE,Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
80724,L425876,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!"

80726,L425863,u2401,m153,PETE,The hell you say! Wash is kin!
80727,L425862,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
80728,L425810,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
80729,L425809,u2401,m153,PETE,Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
80730,L425808,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!"
80731,L425807,u2401,m153,PETE,Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
80732,L425894,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!"
80733,L425893,u2402,m153,PROPRIETOR,"Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks."

80735,L425891,u2402,m153,PROPRIETOR,I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
80736,L425890,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan."
80737,L425889,u2402,m153,PROPRIETOR,Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
80738,L425888,u2394,m153,EVERETT,Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
80739,L425978,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write."
80740,L425977,u2397,m153,MAN,"Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece."
80741,L425976,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!"
80742,L425972,u2394,m153,EVERETT,"Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?"
80743,L425971,u2397,m153,MAN,"Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-"

80779,L427317,u2405,m154,BYRON,I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
80780,L427035,u2415,m154,ZACK,"What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?"
80781,L427034,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!"
80782,L427033,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!"
80783,L427032,u2405,m154,BYRON,I never said any of that!
80784,L427031,u2415,m154,ZACK,"She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her..."
80785,L427030,u2405,m154,BYRON,I wrote. Not every week...
80786,L427029,u2415,m154,ZACK,That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
80787,L427028,u2405,m154,BYRON,There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
80788,L427027,u2415,m154,ZACK,"What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important."
80789,L427026,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please."
80790,L427025,u2415,m154,ZACK,That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
80791,L427024,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --"
80792,L427023,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yeah, I know."
80793,L427022,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?"
80794,L427021,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yeah, I sort of thought so myself."
80795,L427020,u2405,m154,BYRON,Great ass.
80796,L427019,u2415,m154,ZACK,Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
80797,L427018,u2405,m154,BYRON,Who's that?
80798,L426609,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad."
80799,L426608,u2415,m154,ZACK,"From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present."
80800,L426607,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?"
80801,L426606,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you."
80802,L426605,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?"
80803,L426604,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?"
80804,L426603,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed."
80805,L426600,u2415,m154,ZACK,Nobody. It just came to me.
80806,L426599,u2405,m154,BYRON,Who gave you this idea?
80807,L426598,u2415,m154,ZACK,To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
80808,L426597,u2405,m154,BYRON,Why?
80809,L426596,u2415,m154,ZACK,That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
80810,L426595,u2405,m154,BYRON,You... in the Navy?
80811,L426594,u2415,m154,ZACK,I joined the Navy.
80812,L426593,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled."
80813,L426592,u2415,m154,ZACK,Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
80814,L426591,u2405,m154,BYRON,So what're you doing in Seattle?
80815,L426588,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla."
80816,L426587,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I."
80817,L426581,u2405,m154,BYRON,Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
80818,L426580,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown."
80819,L426579,u2405,m154,BYRON,I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
80820,L426578,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree."
80821,L426577,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!"
80822,L426576,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Neither have you, pard!"
80823,L426575,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!"
80824,L426574,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hi, Byron."
80825,L426562,u2405,m154,BYRON,Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
80826,L426561,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Thank you, sir!"
80827,L426560,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Okay, okay. You win."
80828,L426559,u2415,m154,ZACK,What for?
80829,L426558,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Come back here, kid!"
80830,L426556,u2415,m154,ZACK,I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
80831,L426555,u2405,m154,BYRON,You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
80832,L426554,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I ain't never going back to that school, sir."
80833,L426553,u2405,m154,BYRON,"I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia."
80834,L426552,u2415,m154,ZACK,Great.
80835,L426551,u2405,m154,BYRON,This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
80836,L426547,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Well, that's how long I've been out at sea."
80837,L426546,u2415,m154,ZACK,I been calling for four months.
80838,L426545,u2405,m154,BYRON,"Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea..."
80839,L426544,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yes, sir."
80840,L426543,u2405,m154,BYRON,"How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?"
80841,L426541,u2405,m154,BYRON,I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
80842,L426540,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yes, Sir."
80843,L426539,u2405,m154,BYRON,"You, Zack?"
80844,L427190,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!"
80845,L427189,u2406,m154,CASEY,"Go on, Zack! Go for the record!"
80846,L427158,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!"
80847,L427157,u2406,m154,CASEY,"Zack, we've got to go."
80848,L426737,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger."
80849,L426736,u2406,m154,CASEY,"The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?"
80850,L426735,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest."
80851,L426734,u2406,m154,CASEY,"Ever heard of knocking, mayo?"
80852,L426733,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Good morning, girls."
80853,L426719,u2415,m154,ZACK,Great. You can go in my place.
80854,L426718,u2406,m154,CASEY,Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
80855,L426717,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down."
80856,L426691,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am..."
80857,L426690,u2406,m154,CASEY,"You're pretty funny, Mayo."
80858,L427076,u2410,m154,JOE,I don't mean anything by it.
80859,L427075,u2407,m154,ESTHER,"He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?"
80860,L426850,u2407,m154,ESTHER,A long time ago.
80861,L426849,u2410,m154,JOE,When did this happen?
80862,L426848,u2407,m154,ESTHER,"Yes, Joe."
80863,L426847,u2410,m154,JOE,"Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?"
80864,L426836,u2410,m154,JOE,Come over here where I can see you.
80865,L426835,u2407,m154,ESTHER,Joe!
80866,L427328,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you."
80867,L427327,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"See you in the fleet, sir!"
80868,L427326,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Well, goodbye."
80869,L427325,u2408,m154,FOLEY,I know.
80870,L427324,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant."
80871,L427323,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!"
80872,L427306,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Get on your feet and find out how good, sir."
80873,L427305,u2408,m154,FOLEY,You're good.
80874,L427301,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yes, sir!"
80875,L427300,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here."
80876,L427298,u2415,m154,ZACK,Aw screw it...
80877,L427297,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!"
80878,L427296,u2415,m154,ZACK,"It's important, sir!"
80879,L427295,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait."
80880,L427294,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private."
80881,L427293,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry."
80882,L427224,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!"
80883,L427223,u2415,m154,ZACK,I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
80884,L427216,u2415,m154,ZACK,"But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir."
80885,L427215,u2408,m154,FOLEY,It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
80886,L427214,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?"
80887,L426976,u2408,m154,FOLEY,Maybe there's hope for you yet.
80888,L426975,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yes, sir!"
80889,L426974,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Mayo, are those your friends?"
80890,L426968,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Not a fucking chance, asshole!"
80891,L426967,u2415,m154,ZACK,"That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!"
80892,L426966,u2408,m154,FOLEY,Pity you don't have the character.
80893,L426965,u2415,m154,ZACK,I don't want to do something anybody can do.
80894,L426964,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"What is it, the kicks? Is that it?"
80895,L426963,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No, sir!"
80896,L426962,u2408,m154,FOLEY,Why? Because you can do it alone?
80897,L426961,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I want to fly jets, sir!"
80898,L426960,u2408,m154,FOLEY,That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
80899,L426959,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I want to fly, sir!"
80900,L426957,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!"
80901,L426956,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Sir, that's not true! I love my country!"
80902,L426955,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans."
80903,L426954,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!"
80904,L426953,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me."
80905,L426950,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do."
80906,L426949,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I'm doing okay, sir."
80907,L426948,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?"
80908,L426947,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?"
80909,L426946,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this."
80910,L426945,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?"
80911,L426942,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit."
80912,L426941,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting."
80913,L426940,u2408,m154,FOLEY,I want your D.O.R.
80914,L426653,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise."
80915,L426652,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines."
80916,L426651,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work."
80917,L426650,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Not exactly, sir."
80918,L426649,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?"
80919,L426648,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!"
80920,L426647,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"What's your name, boy?"
80921,L426645,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No, sir!"
80922,L426644,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?"
80923,L427222,u2414,m154,SID,"Zack, don't!"
80924,L427221,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"What did you call me, Mayo?"
80925,L426679,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!"
80926,L426678,u2414,m154,SID,"Whatever you say, Mayonnaise."
80927,L426643,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!"
80928,L426642,u2414,m154,SID,"No, sir."
80929,L426641,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer."
80930,L426640,u2414,m154,SID,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."
80931,L426639,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Where are you from, boy?"
80932,L426638,u2414,m154,SID,"No, sir."
80933,L426637,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?"
80934,L426636,u2414,m154,SID,"No, sir!"
80935,L426635,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Lauder, Sweet Pea!"
80936,L426634,u2414,m154,SID,"No, sir."
80937,L426633,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"No, sir!"
80938,L426632,u2414,m154,SID,No.
80939,L426631,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?"
80940,L426630,u2414,m154,SID,I didn't call you anything before that.
80941,L426629,u2408,m154,FOLEY,Before that.
80942,L426628,u2414,m154,SID,I called you Sarge.
80943,L426627,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"What did you call me, boy?"
80944,L426626,u2414,m154,SID,Pardon?
80945,L426625,u2408,m154,FOLEY,What did you call me?
80946,L426624,u2414,m154,SID,"How're you doing, Sarge?"
80947,L426623,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Hi, son."
80948,L426622,u2409,m154,GROUP,"Yes, sir!"
80949,L426621,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?"
80950,L426620,u2409,m154,GROUP,"Yes, sir!"
80951,L426619,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!"
80952,L426618,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet."
80953,L426617,u2409,m154,GROUP,"Yes, sir!!"
80954,L426616,u2408,m154,FOLEY,Louder!
80955,L426615,u2409,m154,GROUP,"Yes, sir!"
80956,L426614,u2408,m154,FOLEY,"Now when I say ""understand"" I want the whole group to say, ""Yes, sir!"" Understand?"
80957,L426845,u2410,m154,JOE,Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
80958,L426844,u2412,m154,PAULA,Yes I do!
80959,L426843,u2410,m154,JOE,Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
80960,L426842,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!"
80961,L426841,u2410,m154,JOE,"Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys."
80962,L426840,u2412,m154,PAULA,Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
80963,L426839,u2410,m154,JOE,"But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --"
80964,L426838,u2412,m154,PAULA,I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
80965,L426834,u2410,m154,JOE,What are you tired from?
80966,L426833,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I..."
80967,L426832,u2410,m154,JOE,"I said, come here!"
80968,L426831,u2412,m154,PAULA,"I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and..."
80969,L427254,u2414,m154,SID,"Well, I'll be goddamned."
80970,L427253,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid."
80971,L427252,u2414,m154,SID,What?
80972,L427251,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Sid, there's no baby."
80973,L427250,u2414,m154,SID,"Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it."
80974,L427249,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
80975,L427248,u2414,m154,SID,"I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now."
80976,L427247,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,You what?
80977,L427246,u2414,m154,SID,"We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed."
80978,L427245,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii."
80979,L427244,u2414,m154,SID,"That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!"
80980,L427243,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean..."
80981,L427242,u2414,m154,SID,"No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck."
80982,L427241,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
80983,L427240,u2414,m154,SID,Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
80984,L427239,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble."
80985,L427238,u2414,m154,SID,"Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you."
80986,L427174,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Let's just wait and see what happens.
80987,L427173,u2414,m154,SID,"...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?"
80988,L427172,u2414,m154,SID,"My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing."
80989,L427171,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"What other issue is there, Sid?"
80990,L427170,u2414,m154,SID,"No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that."
80991,L427169,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?"
80992,L427168,u2414,m154,SID,"Exactly how late are you, Lynette?"
80993,L427167,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility."
80994,L427166,u2414,m154,SID,How late?
80995,L427165,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"I'm a little late, that's all."
80996,L427164,u2414,m154,SID,"By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?"
80997,L427121,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Then, I'll see you around."
80998,L427120,u2414,m154,SID,"Lynette, I told you already, it won't work."
80999,L427119,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel."
81000,L427118,u2414,m154,SID,"Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?"
81001,L427117,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me."
81002,L426878,u2414,m154,SID,Or we could do that yeah.
81003,L426877,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
81004,L426876,u2414,m154,SID,What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
81005,L426803,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
81006,L426802,u2414,m154,SID,You're sure it's okay?
81007,L426801,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
81008,L426800,u2414,m154,SID,Something tells me you've been here before.
81009,L426792,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,We don't have to talk at all.
81010,L426791,u2414,m154,SID,I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
81011,L426790,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him."
81012,L426789,u2414,m154,SID,Yeah.
81013,L426788,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Vietnam?
81014,L426787,u2414,m154,SID,He was. He died.
81015,L426786,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Is your brother a flyer?
81016,L426785,u2414,m154,SID,"Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can."
81017,L426784,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
81018,L426763,u2414,m154,SID,"Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived."
81019,L426762,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
81020,L427270,u2412,m154,PAULA,No! That's not true!
81021,L427269,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!"
81022,L427268,u2412,m154,PAULA,"God help you, Lynette!"
81023,L427260,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
81024,L427259,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Lynette, where's Sid?"
81025,L427060,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,I do.
81026,L427059,u2412,m154,PAULA,No. I never feel like that.
81027,L427058,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?"
81028,L427057,u2412,m154,PAULA,"That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward."
81029,L427056,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you."
81030,L427055,u2412,m154,PAULA,No way... Would you?
81031,L427054,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
81032,L427053,u2412,m154,PAULA,What do you mean?
81033,L427052,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?"
81034,L427051,u2412,m154,PAULA,I haven't made up my mind.
81035,L427050,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,You serious about having him over?
81036,L426827,u2412,m154,PAULA,He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
81037,L426826,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,You hope.
81038,L426825,u2412,m154,PAULA,"I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number."
81039,L426824,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come."
81040,L426823,u2412,m154,PAULA,He ask you out for next weekend?
81041,L426821,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'"
81042,L426820,u2412,m154,PAULA,How did it go with you guys?
81043,L426818,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,But in what ways?
81044,L426817,u2412,m154,PAULA,Everything was different.
81045,L426816,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
81046,L426815,u2412,m154,PAULA,Yeah... Mmmm...
81047,L426814,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body."
81048,L426813,u2412,m154,PAULA,Great.
81049,L426812,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?"
81050,L426811,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,I got my foot on the floor.
81051,L426810,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight."
81052,L426761,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Come on. Let's go dance.
81053,L426760,u2412,m154,PAULA,"That was you guys, huh?"
81054,L426703,u2412,m154,PAULA,Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
81055,L426702,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,See you in a month when you get liberty!
81056,L426701,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys."
81057,L426700,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Paula, look at the new Poopies."
81058,L426699,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear."
81059,L426698,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
81060,L426665,u2412,m154,PAULA,One more minute.
81061,L426664,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Come on, guys. It's five o'clock."
81062,L427266,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?"
81063,L427265,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??"
81064,L427264,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
81065,L427263,u2415,m154,ZACK,And you turned him down??
81066,L427262,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me."
81067,L427261,u2415,m154,ZACK,What did you tell him about the baby?
81068,L426892,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,"Well, excuse me for livin'!"
81069,L426891,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please."
81070,L426890,u2411,m154,LYNETTE,God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
81071,L427290,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either."
81072,L427289,u2415,m154,ZACK,That's brilliant.
81073,L427288,u2412,m154,PAULA,"However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!"
81074,L427287,u2415,m154,ZACK,I bet you do!
81075,L427286,u2412,m154,PAULA,I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
81076,L427285,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him."
81077,L427284,u2412,m154,PAULA,Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
81078,L427283,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!"
81079,L427282,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you."
81080,L427273,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Because he's my friend, too."
81081,L427272,u2415,m154,ZACK,Why?
81082,L427271,u2412,m154,PAULA,I'd like to come with you.
81083,L427237,u2415,m154,ZACK,I don't know where that is.
81084,L427236,u2412,m154,PAULA,I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
81085,L427235,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?"
81086,L427234,u2412,m154,PAULA,Why'd he do it?
81087,L427233,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him."
81088,L427232,u2412,m154,PAULA,So?
81089,L427231,u2415,m154,ZACK,I'm looking for Sid.
81090,L427101,u2415,m154,ZACK,I know that.
81091,L427100,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture."
81092,L427099,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?"
81093,L427098,u2412,m154,PAULA,Call me during the week if you get the chance.
81094,L427096,u2415,m154,ZACK,No wonder he was looking at me like that.
81095,L427095,u2412,m154,PAULA,Twenty-two years ago.
81096,L427094,u2415,m154,ZACK,Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
81097,L427092,u2415,m154,ZACK,Your real father?
81098,L427091,u2412,m154,PAULA,Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
81099,L427090,u2415,m154,ZACK,Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
81100,L427089,u2412,m154,PAULA,"For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with."
81101,L427088,u2415,m154,ZACK,What would you do differently?
81102,L427087,u2412,m154,PAULA,Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
81103,L427086,u2415,m154,ZACK,No. Is that what you want?
81104,L427085,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family."
81105,L427084,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas."
81106,L427083,u2412,m154,PAULA,"So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?"
81107,L427082,u2412,m154,PAULA,That's okay. I'm used to it.
81108,L427081,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you."
81109,L427080,u2412,m154,PAULA,I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
81110,L427068,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No, they're for your mom."
81111,L427067,u2412,m154,PAULA,Are those for me?
81112,L427066,u2415,m154,ZACK,Hi.
81113,L427048,u2412,m154,PAULA,When I'm good and ready.
81114,L427047,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?"
81115,L427045,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Zack, I don't know if I want to do that..."
81116,L427044,u2415,m154,ZACK,Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
81117,L427041,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, will you just leave me alone?"
81118,L427040,u2412,m154,PAULA,I've seen all that a hundred times.
81119,L427039,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula."
81120,L427038,u2412,m154,PAULA,What's the matter?
81121,L427016,u2412,m154,PAULA,I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
81122,L427015,u2415,m154,ZACK,I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
81123,L427013,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down."
81124,L427012,u2412,m154,PAULA,Does it still hurt?
81125,L427011,u2415,m154,ZACK,The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
81126,L427010,u2412,m154,PAULA,God.
81127,L427009,u2415,m154,ZACK,My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
81128,L427008,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want."
81129,L427007,u2415,m154,ZACK,That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
81130,L427006,u2412,m154,PAULA,"I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act."
81131,L427005,u2415,m154,ZACK,What's stopping you?
81132,L427004,u2412,m154,PAULA,"You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly."
81133,L427001,u2412,m154,PAULA,"They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water..."
81134,L427000,u2415,m154,ZACK,I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
81135,L426999,u2412,m154,PAULA,I don't want you to move.
81136,L426998,u2415,m154,ZACK,I'll get it if you want.
81137,L426997,u2412,m154,PAULA,Want me to get a towel?
81138,L426996,u2412,m154,PAULA,It sure was.
81139,L426995,u2415,m154,ZACK,That was great.
81140,L426924,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Any time, sailor."
81141,L426923,u2415,m154,ZACK,I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
81142,L426922,u2415,m154,ZACK,I've never had a girl.
81143,L426921,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?"
81144,L426919,u2412,m154,PAULA,I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
81145,L426918,u2415,m154,ZACK,You're better than candy.
81146,L426917,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy."
81147,L426914,u2415,m154,ZACK,That's it?
81148,L426913,u2412,m154,PAULA,To have a good time with you until you have to go.
81149,L426912,u2415,m154,ZACK,"What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?"
81150,L426911,u2412,m154,PAULA,I know who you are and what you want.
81151,L426910,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --"
81152,L426909,u2415,m154,ZACK,I'm starving.
81153,L426908,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?"
81154,L426907,u2415,m154,ZACK,You stayed after all.
81155,L426905,u2412,m154,PAULA,"You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!"
81156,L426904,u2415,m154,ZACK,Be a friend. Leave.
81157,L426903,u2412,m154,PAULA,I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
81158,L426902,u2415,m154,ZACK,Forget it. Just get out of here.
81159,L426901,u2412,m154,PAULA,Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
81160,L426900,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed."
81161,L426899,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know."
81162,L426898,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind."
81163,L426897,u2412,m154,PAULA,Where'd you learn to fight like that?
81164,L426896,u2415,m154,ZACK,There's always a choice.
81165,L426895,u2412,m154,PAULA,He didn't give you much choice.
81166,L426894,u2415,m154,ZACK,I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
81167,L426880,u2415,m154,ZACK,My kinda group!
81168,L426879,u2412,m154,PAULA,I vote for the motel.
81169,L426875,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Me, too."
81170,L426874,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week."
81171,L426873,u2415,m154,ZACK,I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
81172,L426798,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You're a very pretty girl, Paula."
81173,L426797,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing."
81174,L426796,u2415,m154,ZACK,Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
81175,L426795,u2412,m154,PAULA,Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
81176,L426783,u2412,m154,PAULA,"No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college."
81177,L426782,u2415,m154,ZACK,Do you go to school?
81178,L426781,u2412,m154,PAULA,"To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles."
81179,L426780,u2415,m154,ZACK,Yeah? Why're you here?
81180,L426779,u2412,m154,PAULA,Not me.
81181,L426778,u2415,m154,ZACK,I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
81182,L426776,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No, and I'm not looking for one either."
81183,L426775,u2412,m154,PAULA,You got a girl?
81184,L426773,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?"
81185,L426772,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi."
81186,L426771,u2412,m154,PAULA,Really?
81187,L426770,u2415,m154,ZACK,My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
81188,L426769,u2412,m154,PAULA,Seriously.
81189,L426768,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack."
81190,L426767,u2412,m154,PAULA,"Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?"
81191,L426766,u2415,m154,ZACK,Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
81192,L426765,u2412,m154,PAULA,Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
81193,L426764,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?"
81194,L426992,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
81195,L426991,u2415,m154,ZACK,The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
81196,L426990,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,He said he grew up poor?
81197,L426989,u2415,m154,ZACK,How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
81198,L426982,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,Yeah. All week long.
81199,L426981,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?"
81200,L426978,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, Sid, thanks."
81201,L426977,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,"I see you didn't DOR, Mayo."
81202,L426935,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation."
81203,L426934,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,"You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend."
81204,L426933,u2415,m154,ZACK,I can't risk it.
81205,L426932,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,"I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack."
81206,L426745,u2415,m154,ZACK,I don't notice anyone else complaining.
81207,L426744,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,"Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?"
81208,L426742,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
81209,L426741,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five."
81210,L426677,u2415,m154,ZACK,"He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?"
81211,L426676,u2413,m154,PERRYMAN,How do you figure that's your bunk?
81212,L427227,u2414,m154,SID,"Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me."
81213,L427226,u2415,m154,ZACK,I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
81214,L427225,u2414,m154,SID,"Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!"
81215,L427218,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?"
81216,L427217,u2414,m154,SID,"He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter."
81217,L427211,u2414,m154,SID,"I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared..."
81218,L427210,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Sid, what happened?"
81219,L427202,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?"
81220,L427201,u2414,m154,SID,"No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it"" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived."
81221,L427200,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?"
81222,L427199,u2414,m154,SID,It's mine.
81223,L427198,u2415,m154,ZACK,Do you know that for sure?
81224,L427197,u2414,m154,SID,But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
81225,L427196,u2415,m154,ZACK,Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
81226,L427195,u2414,m154,SID,"I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?"
81227,L427194,u2415,m154,ZACK,So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
81228,L427193,u2414,m154,SID,"She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere."
81229,L427192,u2415,m154,ZACK,But she expects you to marry her?
81230,L427191,u2414,m154,SID,It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
81231,L427181,u2415,m154,ZACK,Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
81232,L427180,u2414,m154,SID,"No, but she's gotta be at least a month late."
81233,L427179,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?"
81234,L427177,u2414,m154,SID,But it can't wait.
81235,L427176,u2415,m154,ZACK,Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
81236,L427144,u2414,m154,SID,Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
81237,L427143,u2415,m154,ZACK,You should've done what I did. A clean break.
81238,L427142,u2414,m154,SID,"Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?"
81239,L427141,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her."
81240,L427140,u2414,m154,SID,She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
81241,L427139,u2415,m154,ZACK,"I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?"
81242,L427138,u2414,m154,SID,"My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette."
81243,L427137,u2415,m154,ZACK,"No problem, but who's Susan?"
81244,L427136,u2414,m154,SID,Thanks for covering for me.
81245,L427108,u2415,m154,ZACK,"That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week."
81246,L427107,u2414,m154,SID,"I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us."
81247,L427106,u2415,m154,ZACK,Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
81248,L427105,u2414,m154,SID,What? You've gotta be kidding!
81249,L427104,u2415,m154,ZACK,"You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away."
81250,L427103,u2414,m154,SID,"I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?"
81251,L426988,u2414,m154,SID,A little.
81252,L426987,u2415,m154,ZACK,"That isn't true, is it?"
81253,L426984,u2415,m154,ZACK,Naw.
81254,L426983,u2414,m154,SID,"What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?"
81255,L426980,u2414,m154,SID,Yeah.
81256,L426979,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, you guys still awake?"
81257,L426928,u2414,m154,SID,Sure.
81258,L426927,u2415,m154,ZACK,You okay?
81259,L426872,u2414,m154,SID,"Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich."
81260,L426871,u2415,m154,ZACK,"She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts."
81261,L426870,u2414,m154,SID,"Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes."
81262,L426852,u2414,m154,SID,Shhhh...
81263,L426851,u2415,m154,ZACK,Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
81264,L426808,u2414,m154,SID,"Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet."
81265,L426807,u2415,m154,ZACK,'Nellie's Nymphos!'
81266,L426806,u2414,m154,SID,Could you believe those girls!
81267,L426759,u2414,m154,SID,"It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart."
81268,L426758,u2415,m154,ZACK,You told us it would grow out an inch.
81269,L426753,u2414,m154,SID,Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
81270,L426752,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?"
81271,L426724,u2414,m154,SID,"I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?"
81272,L426723,u2415,m154,ZACK,Jets.
81273,L426689,u2415,m154,ZACK,"Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end."
81274,L426688,u2414,m154,SID,Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
81275,L426686,u2415,m154,ZACK,I've seen better.
81276,L426685,u2414,m154,SID,That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
81277,L435154,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!"
81278,L435153,u2422,m155,RAOUL,YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
81279,L435147,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!"
81280,L435146,u2422,m155,RAOUL,We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
81281,L435145,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
81282,L435144,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!"
81283,L435143,u2422,m155,RAOUL,NOT THAT ONE?!
81284,L435142,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Not that one.
81285,L435141,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"The walls are steel, right?"
81286,L435133,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You know how this gotta end.
81287,L435132,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Bullshit.
81288,L435131,u2422,m155,RAOUL,The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
81289,L435130,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Get the fuck away from me.
81290,L435129,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that."
81291,L435128,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,-- posed to mean?
81292,L435127,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You finish.  Then we finish.
81293,L435126,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
81294,L435125,u2422,m155,RAOUL,That's their problem.
81295,L435124,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,That's your problem.
81296,L435091,u2422,m155,RAOUL,She better.
81297,L435090,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,She's gonna handle it.
81298,L435089,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us."
81299,L435088,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!"
81300,L435068,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Are you gonna open the safe?
81301,L435067,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!"
81302,L435062,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour."
81303,L435061,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?"
81304,L435049,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over."
81305,L435048,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,The hell does she want?
81306,L435047,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"Hurry up, for Christ's sake!"
81307,L435046,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Are you okay?
81308,L435026,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something."
81309,L435025,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You got an idea?
81310,L435024,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Okay, okay!  Okay."
81311,L435023,u2422,m155,RAOUL,Th --
81312,L435022,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,I can't just...
81313,L435021,u2422,m155,RAOUL,Two.  Squeeze harder.
81314,L435020,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,This is ridiculous...
81315,L435019,u2422,m155,RAOUL,One.  Squeeze.
81316,L435018,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
81317,L435017,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,I can't...
81318,L435016,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
81319,L435015,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,I can't.
81320,L435014,u2422,m155,RAOUL,What do you think?  Get us into that room.
81321,L435013,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,What?  What do you want me to do?
81322,L435012,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Please...
81323,L435011,u2422,m155,RAOUL,Remember that.
81324,L435010,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Yes.
81325,L435009,u2422,m155,RAOUL,I have the gun.
81326,L435008,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
81327,L435007,u2422,m155,RAOUL,That's right.
81328,L435006,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Me.  I am.
81329,L435005,u2422,m155,RAOUL,Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
81330,L435004,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Stop it!  Stop it!
81331,L435002,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!"
81332,L435001,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,The fuck did you do that for?!
81333,L435000,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You should see the look on your face.
81334,L434865,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
81335,L434864,u2422,m155,RAOUL,He said open it.
81336,L434833,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room."
81337,L434832,u2422,m155,RAOUL,So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
81338,L434829,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony."
81339,L434828,u2422,m155,RAOUL,There is not one thing funny here.
81340,L434827,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,God.
81341,L434826,u2422,m155,RAOUL,What the fuck is funny about this?
81342,L434823,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,She didn't.
81343,L434822,u2422,m155,RAOUL,What if she called the cops?
81344,L434754,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Peace out.
81345,L434753,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You're welcome.
81346,L434742,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
81347,L434741,u2422,m155,RAOUL,No problem.
81348,L434737,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Not with me.  Not with people.
81349,L434736,u2422,m155,RAOUL,You're fuckin' A we can do this.
81350,L434715,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs."
81351,L434714,u2422,m155,RAOUL,What?
81352,L434997,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Adios.
81353,L434996,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,I mean it!
81354,L434995,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Yeah, whatever."
81355,L434994,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
81356,L434985,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude."
81357,L434984,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe."
81358,L434978,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,What about us?
81359,L434977,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing."
81360,L434976,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close."
81361,L434964,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Jesus, what was I thinking?"
81362,L434963,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Do me a favor and don't talk.
81363,L434962,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,And we're never getting in.
81364,L434961,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Hey.
81365,L434960,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,She's never coming out.
81366,L434916,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Shit!
81367,L434915,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Cell phone.
81368,L434875,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?"
81369,L434874,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine."
81370,L434873,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,They're gonna die in there!
81371,L434872,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,They're coughing.
81372,L434871,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"We're trying to scare them, not kill them!"
81373,L434870,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Be quiet.
81374,L434863,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,I did.
81375,L434862,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Open it.
81376,L434831,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
81377,L434830,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?"
81378,L434825,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones."
81379,L434824,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,She said she did.
81380,L434821,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?"
81381,L434820,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help."
81382,L434819,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Shut up and let me think.
81383,L434818,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
81384,L434817,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Shut up.
81385,L434816,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"Got her right where you want her, Junior."
81386,L434760,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand."
81387,L434759,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Pure idiot.
81388,L434758,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure."
81389,L434757,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Yeah.  Kidnapping.
81390,L434756,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
81391,L434752,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,The fuck did you bring a gun for?
81392,L434751,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Different tables.
81393,L434750,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,What tables?  I've never seen him before.
81394,L434749,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now."
81395,L434748,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Where did you get this clown?
81396,L434747,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?"
81397,L434746,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Asshole.
81398,L434745,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?"
81399,L434744,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,What about us?  What if she has a gun?
81400,L434743,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,They won't get hurt.
81401,L434740,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
81402,L434739,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked."
81403,L434738,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
81404,L434735,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?"
81405,L434734,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Unless Daddy comes back later.
81406,L434731,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,This is insane.  I'm outta here.
81407,L434730,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
81408,L434729,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Who is this guy?
81409,L434726,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,You're an idiot.
81410,L434725,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"I mean, right?  Isn't it?"
81411,L434724,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
81412,L434723,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
81413,L434722,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!"
81414,L434721,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks."
81415,L434720,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,They're not supposed to be here!
81416,L434719,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,"This was your department, Junior."
81417,L434718,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,They're not supposed to be here!
81418,L434717,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,Keep your voice down.
81419,L434716,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Fuck!
81420,L434713,u2416,m155,BURNHAM,I know.
81421,L434712,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Fuck.
81422,L435119,u2417,m155,COP 1,"The sentence that started ""There are three.""  What was the rest?"
81423,L435118,u2421,m155,MEG,Huh?
81424,L435117,u2417,m155,COP 1,May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
81425,L435112,u2421,m155,MEG,"Oh, that phone call..."
81426,L435111,u2417,m155,COP 1,"Your husband says you said ""There are three..."" right before you got cut off."
81427,L435110,u2421,m155,MEG,"You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?"
81428,L435109,u2417,m155,COP 1,You don't look so good.
81429,L435108,u2421,m155,MEG,Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
81430,L435107,u2417,m155,COP 1,Can we come in?
81431,L435104,u2421,m155,MEG,"No, you can't come in."
81432,L435103,u2417,m155,COP 1,We'd like to come in.
81433,L435102,u2421,m155,MEG,What do you want?
81434,L435101,u2417,m155,COP 1,Can we come in?
81435,L435100,u2421,m155,MEG,Somebody called you?
81436,L435098,u2421,m155,MEG,I don't get it.
81437,L435097,u2417,m155,COP 1,'Bout four o'clock.
81438,L435094,u2421,m155,MEG,Huh?
81439,L435093,u2417,m155,COP 1,Everything okay?
81440,L435092,u2421,m155,MEG,Yeah?
81441,L434689,u2418,m155,EVAN,Not at all.
81442,L434688,u2420,m155,LYDIA,That door is a safely hazard.
81443,L434670,u2418,m155,EVAN,"Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --"
81444,L434669,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!"
81445,L434668,u2418,m155,EVAN,It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
81446,L434667,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"Oh, I've seen these..."
81447,L434658,u2420,m155,LYDIA,KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
81448,L434657,u2418,m155,EVAN,Could the child please stop that?
81449,L434656,u2418,m155,EVAN,Master closet.
81450,L434655,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous."
81451,L434654,u2418,m155,EVAN,I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
81452,L434653,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!"
81453,L434652,u2418,m155,EVAN,Master bath.
81454,L434651,u2420,m155,LYDIA,He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
81455,L434650,u2418,m155,EVAN,"Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office."
81456,L434639,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"No ball, kid."
81457,L434638,u2418,m155,EVAN,I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
81458,L434635,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!"
81459,L434634,u2418,m155,EVAN,"One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --"
81460,L434693,u2421,m155,MEG,Don't!
81461,L434692,u2418,m155,EVAN,"Push that button for me, will you?"
81462,L434686,u2421,m155,MEG,I said open the door.
81463,L434685,u2418,m155,EVAN,That's highly inappropriate.
81464,L434681,u2421,m155,MEG,Open it.
81465,L434680,u2418,m155,EVAN,"Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional."
81466,L434666,u2418,m155,EVAN,"A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times."
81467,L434665,u2421,m155,MEG,A what?
81468,L434641,u2421,m155,MEG,Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
81469,L434640,u2418,m155,EVAN,"Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones."
81470,L434983,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Observe.
81471,L434982,u2422,m155,RAOUL,Nobody leaves.
81472,L434981,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Suit yourself.
81473,L434975,u2422,m155,RAOUL,The hell we are.
81474,L434974,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,We're leaving.
81475,L434901,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, ""Homes,"" you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,"
81476,L434900,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes."
81477,L434899,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?"
81478,L434898,u2422,m155,RAOUL,He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
81479,L434897,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say ""you"" or Raoul,"" got it?"
81480,L434896,u2422,m155,RAOUL,"I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along."
81481,L434895,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"""Half?""  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating."
81482,L434894,u2422,m155,RAOUL,If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
81483,L434893,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine."
81484,L434878,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!"
81485,L434877,u2422,m155,RAOUL,No fucking way.
81486,L434876,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,Cut it back a little bit.
81487,L434733,u2422,m155,RAOUL,It's just the woman and the kid?
81488,L434732,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?"
81489,L434728,u2419,m155,JUNIOR,"It's okay, Raoul."
81490,L434727,u2422,m155,RAOUL,Watch your mouth.
81491,L434684,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide."
81492,L434683,u2421,m155,MEG,Open the door.
81493,L434682,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?"
81494,L434678,u2421,m155,MEG,What's to keep them from prying open the door?
81495,L434677,u2420,m155,LYDIA,The furniture guy?
81496,L434676,u2421,m155,MEG,"No, Edgar Allen."
81497,L434675,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"I don't think so, but I love her album."
81498,L434674,u2421,m155,MEG,Ever read any Poe?
81499,L434673,u2420,m155,LYDIA,Why?
81500,L434672,u2421,m155,MEG,Makes me nervous.
81501,L434662,u2421,m155,MEG,"I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?"
81502,L434661,u2420,m155,LYDIA,What?
81503,L434660,u2421,m155,MEG,Something's weird.
81504,L434631,u2421,m155,MEG,"This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here."
81505,L434630,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is."
81506,L434629,u2421,m155,MEG,How many more do we have after this?
81507,L434628,u2420,m155,LYDIA,No cars.  Feet are faster.
81508,L434627,u2421,m155,MEG,Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
81509,L434626,u2420,m155,LYDIA,"-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --"
81510,L434992,u2423,m155,SARAH,Okay.
81511,L434991,u2421,m155,MEG,"Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?"
81512,L434990,u2423,m155,SARAH,"I'm sorry, Mom."
81513,L434989,u2421,m155,MEG,"Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room."
81514,L434988,u2423,m155,SARAH,Where is the Glucogen?
81515,L434987,u2421,m155,MEG,"No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen."
81516,L434986,u2423,m155,SARAH,What if I spazz out?
81517,L434973,u2423,m155,SARAH,What if I do?
81518,L434972,u2421,m155,MEG,Not an option.
81519,L434971,u2423,m155,SARAH,What if I keep dropping?
81520,L434970,u2421,m155,MEG,"Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine."
81521,L434969,u2423,m155,SARAH,Huh uh.
81522,L434968,u2421,m155,MEG,"Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?"
81523,L434967,u2423,m155,SARAH,"I'm dizzy, not deaf."
81524,L434966,u2421,m155,MEG,"Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?"
81525,L434959,u2423,m155,SARAH,I'm dizzy and thirsty.
81526,L434958,u2421,m155,MEG,What?
81527,L434957,u2423,m155,SARAH,I was trying not to tell you...
81528,L434956,u2421,m155,MEG,Why?
81529,L434955,u2423,m155,SARAH,I'm sorry.
81530,L434954,u2421,m155,MEG,I'm sorry.
81531,L434953,u2421,m155,MEG,He WILL.
81532,L434952,u2423,m155,SARAH,He --
81533,L434951,u2421,m155,MEG,"He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us..."
81534,L434950,u2423,m155,SARAH,Stop it.
81535,L434949,u2421,m155,MEG,"What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police."
81536,L434948,u2423,m155,SARAH,He won't even know who it was.
81537,L434947,u2421,m155,MEG,"He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said ""There are three..."""
81538,L434946,u2423,m155,SARAH,Uh uh.
81539,L434945,u2421,m155,MEG,He'll do something.
81540,L434941,u2421,m155,MEG,On it!
81541,L434940,u2423,m155,SARAH,Call Dad!
81542,L434933,u2421,m155,MEG,"Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!"
81543,L434932,u2423,m155,SARAH,Blue is phones?
81544,L434931,u2421,m155,MEG,"Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!"
81545,L434924,u2421,m155,MEG,"I saw something, I saw..."
81546,L434923,u2423,m155,SARAH,What are you doing?
81547,L434910,u2421,m155,MEG,Close it!
81548,L434909,u2423,m155,SARAH,No.
81549,L434908,u2421,m155,MEG,"If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door."
81550,L434907,u2423,m155,SARAH,Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
81551,L434906,u2421,m155,MEG,"Yeah, but where's the third guy?"
81552,L434905,u2423,m155,SARAH,Do it.
81553,L434892,u2421,m155,MEG,Shhh...
81554,L434891,u2423,m155,SARAH,We're never getting out of here.
81555,L434889,u2423,m155,SARAH,"Come on, come on..."

81593,L434786,u2421,m155,MEG,They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.

81621,L435905,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us."
81622,L435904,u2424,m156,ALMA,No...
81623,L435899,u2424,m156,ALMA,"Fuck that, we've got company..."
81624,L435898,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Alma I told you to...

81632,L435801,u2424,m156,ALMA,Little Bobby... Just a kid...
81633,L435462,u2424,m156,ALMA,"But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this ""Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet"" bullshit either!"
81634,L435461,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Uhh... I with it sister but...
81635,L435460,u2424,m156,ALMA,What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
81636,L435459,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
81637,L435375,u2435,m156,HUEY,"They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!"
81638,L435374,u2425,m156,BEEFY COP,For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
81639,L435372,u2435,m156,HUEY,"I tell you ""officer"", it wasn't..."
81640,L435371,u2425,m156,BEEFY COP,Well... is it loaded?
81641,L435361,u2435,m156,HUEY,No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
81642,L435360,u2425,m156,BEEFY COP,Lemme see that rifle son...
81643,L435356,u2435,m156,HUEY,What are doing with yours?.
81644,L435355,u2425,m156,BEEFY COP,What are you doing with the gun?
81645,L435354,u2435,m156,HUEY,"I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law."
81646,L435353,u2425,m156,BEEFY COP,"Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?"
81647,L435789,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it..."
81648,L435788,u2426,m156,BOBBY,"Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him."
81649,L435787,u2435,m156,HUEY,You got to sit on Eldridge...
81650,L435543,u2426,m156,BOBBY,You know it brother.
81651,L435542,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?"
81652,L435515,u2435,m156,HUEY,"I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay."
81653,L435514,u2426,m156,BOBBY,That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
81654,L435513,u2435,m156,HUEY,"What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to..."
81655,L435512,u2426,m156,BOBBY,"What it be is, You aren't coming with us."
81656,L435511,u2435,m156,HUEY,"This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?"
81657,L435288,u2435,m156,HUEY,Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
81658,L435287,u2426,m156,BOBBY,Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
81659,L435230,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight."
81660,L435229,u2426,m156,BOBBY,Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
81661,L435481,u2427,m156,BOBBY SEALE,No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
81662,L435480,u2435,m156,HUEY,...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
81663,L435284,u2427,m156,BOBBY SEALE,"Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying ""Black is Beautiful."""
81664,L435283,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?"
81665,L435282,u2427,m156,BOBBY SEALE,What's up?
81666,L435281,u2435,m156,HUEY,Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
81667,L435280,u2427,m156,BOBBY SEALE,Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
81668,L435701,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
81669,L435700,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's ""undercover operation"" has been a complete travesty."
81670,L435699,u2438,m156,RODGERS,Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
81671,L435698,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,What the fuck?
81672,L435387,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement."
81673,L435386,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Like?
81674,L435383,u2438,m156,RODGERS,They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
81675,L435382,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
81676,L435381,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?"
81677,L435380,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
81678,L435824,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,"I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost."
81679,L435823,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Who? I mean besides the FBI?
81680,L435822,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,"Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find."
81681,L435821,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Who's they?
81682,L435820,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
81683,L435819,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Brimmer you're fucked up...
81684,L435818,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
81685,L435817,u2436,m156,JUDGE,What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
81686,L435816,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
81687,L435813,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
81688,L435812,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Hey... what the hell you doing?
81689,L435630,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,"Judge, calm down."
81690,L435629,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!"
81691,L435628,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,"Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?"
81692,L435627,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Yeah, it's me."
81693,L435626,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Inspector Brimmer
81694,L435561,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,"Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, ""By any means necessary."""
81695,L435560,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I can't... they don't operate that way...
81696,L435559,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,"Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!"
81697,L435558,u2436,m156,JUDGE,What are you crazy?
81698,L435556,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Get out of the fucking car.
81699,L435555,u2436,m156,JUDGE,What's with you?
81700,L435554,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Get out of the car.
81701,L435553,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
81702,L435552,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah... whatever you say.
81703,L435551,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
81704,L435550,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
81705,L435549,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
81706,L435508,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I got you.
81707,L435507,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,"I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as ""friendly"" as today."
81708,L435505,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah.
81709,L435504,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,So... we understand each other Judge?

81711,L435466,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
81712,L435465,u2428,m156,BRIMMER,You're Judge right? We need to talk.

81743,L435326,u2429,m156,CY,"Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag."
81744,L435325,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking."
81745,L435324,u2429,m156,CY,...Glad you came man.
81746,L435314,u2429,m156,CY,"No man. PE -- ""political education."""
81747,L435313,u2436,m156,JUDGE,PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
81748,L435312,u2429,m156,CY,"Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out."
81749,L435311,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out ""Cloud Nine."" Just like old times."
81750,L435306,u2429,m156,CY,"Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!"
81751,L435305,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Hey, this what they got you doing now?"
81752,L435235,u2429,m156,CY,Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
81753,L435234,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system."
81754,L435233,u2429,m156,CY,C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
81755,L435232,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I don't know. Look around man.
81756,L435231,u2429,m156,CY,Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
81757,L435760,u2430,m156,DORSETT,You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
81758,L435759,u2438,m156,RODGERS,I don't think that will be any problem...
81759,L435751,u2438,m156,RODGERS,Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
81760,L435750,u2430,m156,DORSETT,To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
81761,L435747,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it."
81762,L435746,u2430,m156,DORSETT,Rodgers... this is no good...
81763,L435704,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction."
81764,L435703,u2430,m156,DORSETT,Jesus...
81765,L435702,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau."
81766,L435659,u2430,m156,DORSETT,"No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. ""Advisory Basis"" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished."
81767,L435658,u2438,m156,RODGERS,Are you finished?
81768,L435657,u2430,m156,DORSETT,"I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city..."
81769,L435385,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made..."
81770,L435384,u2430,m156,DORSETT,Now hold on Rodgers...
81771,L435379,u2438,m156,RODGERS,They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
81772,L435378,u2430,m156,DORSETT,"One: ""We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community."" Two: ""We want full employment for our people."" Three: ""We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community."" Christ, they're asking for reparations..."
81773,L435262,u2438,m156,RODGERS,That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
81774,L435261,u2430,m156,DORSETT,You want me to put a man on it?
81775,L435260,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly ""sensitive"" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left."
81776,L435259,u2430,m156,DORSETT,Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
81777,L435258,u2438,m156,RODGERS,Can you make a deal with them?
81778,L435257,u2430,m156,DORSETT,"Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,"
81779,L435256,u2438,m156,RODGERS,I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
81780,L435255,u2430,m156,DORSETT,"Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about."
81781,L435254,u2438,m156,RODGERS,It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
81782,L435253,u2430,m156,DORSETT,Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
81783,L435688,u2435,m156,HUEY,"...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up."
81784,L435687,u2431,m156,ELDRIDGE,"The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, ""the moment the match is being put to the fuse."" Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white."
81785,L435686,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time."
81786,L435685,u2431,m156,ELDRIDGE,"Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility."
81787,L435684,u2435,m156,HUEY,Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
81788,L435683,u2431,m156,ELDRIDGE,"But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out."
81789,L435851,u2433,m156,GENE,Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
81790,L435850,u2432,m156,GARRY,Did you shoot the officers in question?
81791,L435849,u2433,m156,GENE,I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
81792,L435848,u2432,m156,GARRY,"Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?"
81793,L435847,u2433,m156,GENE,No sir he didn't.
81794,L435846,u2432,m156,GARRY,"From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?"
81795,L435845,u2433,m156,GENE,"Yes sir, I did."
81796,L435844,u2432,m156,GARRY,And did you witness the shoot-out?
81797,L435843,u2433,m156,GENE,Yes sir I was.
81798,L435745,u2434,m156,HOOVER,"Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred."
81799,L435744,u2438,m156,RODGERS,You mean...
81800,L435743,u2434,m156,HOOVER,"Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards."
81801,L435742,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have ""underestimated"" the support of the Black community. It's their power base..."
81802,L435741,u2434,m156,HOOVER,"Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?"
81803,L435740,u2438,m156,RODGERS,"Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left..."
81804,L435547,u2434,m156,HOOVER,Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
81805,L435546,u2438,m156,RODGERS,We're working on that...
81806,L435545,u2434,m156,HOOVER,"Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside."
81807,L435544,u2438,m156,RODGERS,...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
81808,L435679,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before."
81809,L435678,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"Yeah man, but where's Judge?"
81810,L435589,u2435,m156,HUEY,Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
81811,L435588,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Alone...
81812,L435587,u2435,m156,HUEY,So talk...
81813,L435586,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Huey man I got to talk with you...
81814,L435518,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
81815,L435517,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to..."
81816,L435488,u2435,m156,HUEY,No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
81817,L435487,u2442,m156,TYRONE,C'mon let's...
81818,L435470,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?"
81819,L435469,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?"
81820,L435350,u2442,m156,TYRONE,We're like policing the police.
81821,L435349,u2435,m156,HUEY,"This here's a ""Panther Patrol."" We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer."
81822,L435299,u2435,m156,HUEY,Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
81823,L435298,u2442,m156,TYRONE,We need money first...
81824,L435297,u2435,m156,HUEY,We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
81825,L435286,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security."
81826,L435285,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers."
81827,L435222,u2435,m156,HUEY,"The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby..."
81828,L435221,u2442,m156,TYRONE,That's right brother... listen and learn.
81829,L435444,u2435,m156,HUEY,"No you wait a second. You and your ""Panthers"" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation."
81830,L435443,u2440,m156,ROY,Wait a second there brother...
81831,L435442,u2435,m156,HUEY,Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
81832,L435441,u2440,m156,ROY,A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
81833,L435440,u2435,m156,HUEY,We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
81834,L435294,u2440,m156,ROY,I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
81835,L435293,u2435,m156,HUEY,"No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?"
81836,L435292,u2440,m156,ROY,Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
81837,L435291,u2435,m156,HUEY,That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
81838,L435598,u2435,m156,HUEY,Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
81839,L435597,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with ""violent intent."" We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared."
81840,L435596,u2435,m156,HUEY,If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
81841,L435595,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
81842,L435592,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Like the manual says, ""Information is..."
81843,L435591,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?"
81844,L435590,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters."
81845,L435528,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker."
81846,L435527,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Man, this shit's pretty thick."
81847,L435526,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
81848,L435525,u2435,m156,HUEY,And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
81849,L435524,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah.
81850,L435523,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing."
81851,L435522,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Brimmer.
81852,L435521,u2435,m156,HUEY,What's the pig's name?
81853,L435520,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything."
81854,L435519,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
81855,L435457,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust..."
81856,L435456,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
81857,L435455,u2435,m156,HUEY,"I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?"
81858,L435454,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?"
81859,L435453,u2435,m156,HUEY,"See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce."
81860,L435452,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"What, I don't know how you mean?"
81861,L435451,u2435,m156,HUEY,I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
81862,L435450,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I don't know about that.
81863,L435449,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous."
81864,L435436,u2436,m156,JUDGE,They were empty...
81865,L435435,u2435,m156,HUEY,"What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day..."
81866,L435418,u2435,m156,HUEY,Right on Brother Judge...
81867,L435417,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Whatever you need, I'll be there."
81868,L435416,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important."
81869,L435415,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?"
81870,L435414,u2435,m156,HUEY,Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
81871,L435413,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
81872,L435412,u2435,m156,HUEY,"You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for."
81873,L435411,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But...
81874,L435410,u2435,m156,HUEY,Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
81875,L435409,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I'm down.
81876,L435408,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?"
81877,L435348,u2436,m156,JUDGE,No man. Gonna walk.
81878,L435347,u2435,m156,HUEY,"Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift."
81879,L435346,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah... let me think about it.
81880,L435345,u2435,m156,HUEY,You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
81881,L435344,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I don't know.
81882,L435343,u2435,m156,HUEY,Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
81883,L435342,u2435,m156,HUEY,Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
81884,L435341,u2436,m156,JUDGE,So what's the deal?
81885,L435340,u2435,m156,HUEY,We appreciate your help with this.
81886,L435330,u2435,m156,HUEY,So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
81887,L435329,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah.
81888,L435328,u2435,m156,HUEY,You were. infantry right?
81889,L435907,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Later for that. I'm done either way...
81890,L435906,u2436,m156,JUDGE,We'll all get out of here together.
81891,L435903,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
81892,L435902,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Motherfuckers...
81893,L435887,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
81894,L435886,u2436,m156,JUDGE,You alright?
81895,L435873,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Shut the fuck up!!
81896,L435872,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse..."
81897,L435871,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
81898,L435869,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Bullshit...
81899,L435868,u2436,m156,JUDGE,The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
81900,L435867,u2442,m156,TYRONE,What are you saying?
81901,L435866,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that."
81902,L435861,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge?"
81903,L435860,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Fuck is up?!
81904,L435637,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station."
81905,L435636,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Sorry man...
81906,L435635,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Yeah, ""brother"" My best friend is stone dead."
81907,L435634,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"You got something on your mind... ""brother."""
81908,L435633,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Nothing.
81909,L435632,u2442,m156,TYRONE,What's up with you?
81910,L435621,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
81911,L435620,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"If you got something to say, say it."
81912,L435619,u2442,m156,TYRONE,What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
81913,L435407,u2442,m156,TYRONE,He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
81914,L435406,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Huh?
81915,L435332,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Just the legit shit.
81916,L435331,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
81917,L435317,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Fuck maybe... be there.
81918,L435316,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Maybe...
81919,L435315,u2442,m156,TYRONE,You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
81920,L435205,u2442,m156,TYRONE,What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
81921,L435204,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
81922,L435203,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too."
81923,L435202,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Just a kid.
81924,L435201,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up."
81925,L435197,u2436,m156,JUDGE,And who is we?
81926,L435196,u2442,m156,TYRONE,Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
81927,L435194,u2442,m156,TYRONE,"Well, act like it. Come on."
81928,L435193,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Yeah, I do."
81929,L435192,u2442,m156,TYRONE,But nothing... you do live here don't you?
81930,L435191,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I saw... but...
81931,L435833,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero."
81932,L435832,u2439,m156,ROSE,Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
81933,L435831,u2436,m156,JUDGE,God damn it's him. I gotta go.
81934,L435830,u2439,m156,ROSE,"No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger."
81935,L435829,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
81936,L435828,u2439,m156,ROSE,"Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back."
81937,L435827,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Rose?
81938,L435673,u2439,m156,ROSE,Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
81939,L435672,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Why didn't you tell me?
81940,L435671,u2439,m156,ROSE,Ain't no one seen him.
81941,L435670,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Where is he?.
81942,L435669,u2439,m156,ROSE,It was Sabu killed Cy.
81943,L435668,u2436,m156,JUDGE,What?
81944,L435667,u2439,m156,ROSE,Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
81945,L435666,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
81946,L435665,u2439,m156,ROSE,Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
81947,L435664,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid."
81948,L435663,u2439,m156,ROSE,This cool the heat off you any?
81949,L435320,u2439,m156,ROSE,"Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but..."
81950,L435319,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Rose, what the hell you doing here?"
81951,L435183,u2439,m156,ROSE,Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
81952,L435182,u2436,m156,JUDGE,My Mom's at that.
81953,L435174,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"All of the above, man...  And then some."
81954,L435173,u2439,m156,ROSE,"You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?"
81955,L435249,u2436,m156,JUDGE,I don't know. I really don't.
81956,L435248,u2437,m156,RITA,You believe that?
81957,L435247,u2436,m156,JUDGE,"Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else..."
81958,L435246,u2437,m156,RITA,"I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God."
81959,L435245,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
81960,L435244,u2437,m156,RITA,You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
81961,L435243,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
81962,L435242,u2437,m156,RITA,"Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison."
81963,L435241,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah.
81964,L435240,u2437,m156,RITA,I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
81965,L435239,u2436,m156,JUDGE,Yeah... cop hit me...
81966,L435238,u2437,m156,RITA,You don't look alright.
81967,L435237,u2436,m156,JUDGE,It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
81968,L436631,u2443,m157,ANNE,Thank you.
81969,L436630,u2452,m157,MARION,Congratulations.
81970,L436629,u2443,m157,ANNE,Late summer.
81971,L436628,u2452,m157,MARION,When?
81972,L436627,u2443,m157,ANNE,Good.
81973,L436626,u2452,m157,MARION,No.
81974,L436625,u2443,m157,ANNE,"Do you think Francis with an ""i"" is too womanly a name for a boy?"
81975,L436624,u2452,m157,MARION,No.
81976,L436623,u2443,m157,ANNE,"Do you think Frances with an ""e"" is too manly a name for a girl?"
81977,L436587,u2452,m157,MARION,It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
81978,L436586,u2443,m157,ANNE,I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
81979,L436468,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"That would be nice, too."
81980,L436467,u2443,m157,ANNE,"Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow."
81981,L436466,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,That would be nice.
81982,L436465,u2443,m157,ANNE,Next time we'll bring more blankets.
81983,L436424,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,It's a start.
81984,L436423,u2443,m157,ANNE,You call that a compliment?
81985,L436422,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea."
81986,L436416,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Uh... uh... I...
81987,L436415,u2443,m157,ANNE,It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
81988,L436414,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan..."
81989,L436413,u2443,m157,ANNE,"I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea."
81990,L436432,u2452,m157,MARION,The hell I do.
81991,L436431,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,You got me beat on both accounts.
81992,L436430,u2452,m157,MARION,"What do you mean, old and ugly?"
81993,L436427,u2452,m157,MARION,"No, he takes after his mother..."
81994,L436426,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
81995,L436378,u2452,m157,MARION,Pride will do.
81996,L436377,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,"Personally, I'd prefer stupidity."
81997,L436373,u2452,m157,MARION,"His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness."
81998,L436372,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,Cheerful news to greet the morn.
81999,L436371,u2452,m157,MARION,I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
82000,L436370,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,Well?
82001,L436362,u2452,m157,MARION,You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
82002,L436361,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,Am I one of that sort?
82003,L436349,u2452,m157,MARION,"His journals, letters, maps, books..."
82004,L436348,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,"I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding."
82005,L436285,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,"Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose."
82006,L436284,u2452,m157,MARION,It worked.  How many men can you raise?
82007,L436283,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
82008,L436282,u2452,m157,MARION,I expect to try.
82009,L436281,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
82010,L436437,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
82011,L436436,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder."
82012,L436435,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,You got salt last week.
82013,L436369,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
82014,L436368,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,I know him well enough?
82015,L436367,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,He's my father.
82016,L436366,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,"You don't know him very well, do you?"
82017,L436365,u2444,m157,BILLINGS,He's not making light.
82018,L436364,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
82019,L436771,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,Lovely.
82020,L436770,u2452,m157,MARION,"Two pounds, fourteen ounces."
82021,L436641,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,Goodbye.
82022,L436640,u2452,m157,MARION,"Goodbye, Charlotte."
82023,L436638,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,"Very well, then."
82024,L436637,u2452,m157,MARION,"Of course, I do."
82025,L436636,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,Do you?
82026,L436635,u2452,m157,MARION,I know that.
82027,L436634,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,"I said, I'm not my sister."
82028,L436633,u2452,m157,MARION,Excuse me?
82029,L436210,u2452,m157,MARION,I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
82030,L436209,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,"If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own."
82031,L436208,u2452,m157,MARION,I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
82032,L436207,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
82033,L436206,u2452,m157,MARION,I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
82034,L436205,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,You couldn't have known.
82035,L436204,u2452,m157,MARION,How did this... how did I let this happen?
82036,L435993,u2452,m157,MARION,Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
82037,L435992,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
82038,L435980,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,As do you.
82039,L435979,u2452,m157,MARION,"You look well, Charlotte."
82040,L435975,u2445,m157,CHARLOTTE,Thank you.
82041,L435974,u2452,m157,MARION,They're from good stock on their mother's side.
82042,L436139,u2457,m157,TARLETON,With a lace table cloth?
82043,L436138,u2446,m157,CONTINENTAL SERGEANT,We did.
82044,L436137,u2457,m157,TARLETON,Who cared for your wounds?
82045,L436136,u2446,m157,CONTINENTAL SERGEANT,First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
82046,L436135,u2457,m157,TARLETON,What unit?
82047,L436134,u2446,m157,CONTINENTAL SERGEANT,"Yes, sir."
82048,L436133,u2457,m157,TARLETON,You're surrendering.
82049,L436529,u2452,m157,MARION,"They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night."
82050,L436528,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Their names, ranks and posts?"
82051,L436526,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,What officers?
82052,L436525,u2452,m157,MARION,"If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men."
82053,L436524,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war."
82054,L436523,u2452,m157,MARION,You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
82055,L436522,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,Sir?
82056,L436521,u2452,m157,MARION,Prisoner exchange.
82057,L436520,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Very well, let us move on to..."
82058,L436519,u2452,m157,MARION,"As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen."
82059,L436518,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
82060,L436517,u2452,m157,MARION,I consider them linked.
82061,L436516,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,That is a separate issue.
82062,L436515,u2452,m157,MARION,"Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?"
82063,L436514,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men."
82064,L436513,u2452,m157,MARION,And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
82065,L436512,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention."
82066,L436511,u2452,m157,MARION,That one is a bit more difficult.
82067,L436510,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable."
82068,L436509,u2452,m157,MARION,Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
82069,L436508,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,Thank you.
82070,L436507,u2452,m157,MARION,I will do so as soon as possible.
82071,L436506,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me."
82072,L436505,u2452,m157,MARION,"Very well, proceed, sir."
82073,L436504,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status."
82074,L436503,u2452,m157,MARION,Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
82075,L436502,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?"
82076,L436501,u2452,m157,MARION,I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
82077,L436500,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,Oh?
82078,L436499,u2452,m157,MARION,I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
82079,L436498,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you..."
82080,L436497,u2452,m157,MARION,Shall we proceed?
82081,L436494,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,As you wish.
82082,L436493,u2452,m157,MARION,Colonel will do.
82083,L436492,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name."
82084,L436491,u2452,m157,MARION,Apology accepted.
82085,L436490,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
82086,L436489,u2452,m157,MARION,"My pleasure, sir."
82087,L436488,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel."
82088,L436756,u2457,m157,TARLETON,"Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center."
82089,L436755,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Do you see that, Colonel?"
82090,L436599,u2457,m157,TARLETON,"I understand, sir."
82091,L436598,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
82092,L436597,u2457,m157,TARLETON,"Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war."
82093,L436596,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,How can we end this madness?
82094,L436595,u2457,m157,TARLETON,Probably.
82095,L436594,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"And if I triumph, you triumph."
82096,L436593,u2457,m157,TARLETON,Perhaps.
82097,L436592,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"If I fail, you fail."
82098,L436476,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,Most certainly.  Arrange it.
82099,L436475,u2457,m157,TARLETON,Are you going to meet with him?
82100,L436474,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
82101,L436407,u2457,m157,TARLETON,"Yes, sir."
82102,L436406,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels."
82103,L436306,u2457,m157,TARLETON,Sir.
82104,L436305,u2447,m157,CORNWALLIS,"My harrier.  Join us, Colonel."
82105,L436688,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,As you did at Fort Wilderness?
82106,L436687,u2452,m157,MARION,"If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course."
82107,L436685,u2452,m157,MARION,Yes.
82108,L436684,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"I see, do as I say, not as I do."
82109,L436683,u2452,m157,MARION,"It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that."
82110,L436682,u2452,m157,MARION,"We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks."
82111,L436681,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Go on.
82112,L436680,u2452,m157,MARION,"We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford."
82113,L436677,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
82114,L436676,u2452,m157,MARION,That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
82115,L436675,u2452,m157,MARION,Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
82116,L436674,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,That's not enough.  Tell me.
82117,L436673,u2452,m157,MARION,That's right.
82118,L436672,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation."
82119,L436671,u2452,m157,MARION,And what do they know?
82120,L436670,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
82121,L436669,u2452,m157,MARION,"Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened."
82122,L436668,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"No, I don't."
82123,L436667,u2452,m157,MARION,You know what happened.
82124,L436666,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?"
82125,L436665,u2452,m157,MARION,She is.  Don't go in there.
82126,L436664,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
82127,L436663,u2452,m157,MARION,Don't go in there.
82128,L436608,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Seven homes along the Black River so far...
82129,L436607,u2452,m157,MARION,Where?
82130,L436606,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well."
82131,L436584,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,I know.
82132,L436583,u2452,m157,MARION,"It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born."
82133,L436582,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Cheraw Falls.
82134,L436581,u2452,m157,MARION,Granted.  Where are you going?
82135,L436580,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?"
82136,L436576,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
82137,L436575,u2452,m157,MARION,What?
82138,L436574,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about."
82139,L436572,u2452,m157,MARION,"She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?"
82140,L436571,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
82141,L436569,u2452,m157,MARION,I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
82142,L436568,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
82143,L436567,u2452,m157,MARION,She spoke?  Susan spoke?
82144,L436464,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,She got me at a more impressionable age.
82145,L436463,u2452,m157,MARION,You learned her lessons better than I.
82146,L436462,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
82147,L436461,u2452,m157,MARION,Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
82148,L436459,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
82149,L436458,u2452,m157,MARION,No...
82150,L436457,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
82151,L436456,u2452,m157,MARION,I should have killed him when I had the chance?
82152,L436455,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured."
82153,L436434,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
82154,L436433,u2452,m157,MARION,Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
82155,L436376,u2452,m157,MARION,Pride is his weakness.
82156,L436375,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Father?
82157,L436374,u2452,m157,MARION,Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
82158,L436347,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"And the dogs, too, I'll wager."
82159,L436346,u2452,m157,MARION,These four wagons must be his.
82160,L436319,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,I didn't see any.
82161,L436318,u2452,m157,MARION,Flanking riders?
82162,L436317,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear."
82163,L436292,u2452,m157,MARION,God help us all when you're forty.
82164,L436291,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,You know how old I am.
82165,L436290,u2452,m157,MARION,How old are you?
82166,L436289,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself."
82167,L436288,u2452,m157,MARION,Is it?
82168,L436275,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Yes...  ... father.
82169,L436274,u2452,m157,MARION,"And, Corporal...  ... be careful."
82170,L436273,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Yes, sir."
82171,L436272,u2452,m157,MARION,"Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island."
82172,L436271,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,He tried.  It didn't take.
82173,L436270,u2452,m157,MARION,Did your father teach you humility?
82174,L436269,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Yes, sir.  My father taught me."
82175,L436268,u2452,m157,MARION,Is that so?
82176,L436267,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston."
82177,L436266,u2452,m157,MARION,Oh?
82178,L436265,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good."
82179,L436264,u2452,m157,MARION,It's safer if we stay together.
82180,L436263,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,We'd cover more ground if we split up.
82181,L436262,u2452,m157,MARION,We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
82182,L436261,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"What now, sir?"
82183,L436224,u2452,m157,MARION,It's already over.
82184,L436223,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Father...
82185,L436117,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"I have no choice, I..."
82186,L436116,u2452,m157,MARION,You're in no condition to ride.
82187,L436115,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
82188,L436112,u2452,m157,MARION,Not yet.  What happened?
82189,L436111,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Have you seen any Redcoats?
82190,L436068,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Yes.
82191,L436067,u2452,m157,MARION,Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
82192,L436066,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them."
82193,L436065,u2452,m157,MARION,"When you have children, I hope you'll understand."
82194,L436064,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle."
82195,L435991,u2452,m157,MARION,Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
82196,L435990,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body."
82197,L435989,u2452,m157,MARION,And the Governor?
82198,L435988,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
82199,L435987,u2452,m157,MARION,Is that why the Assembly was convened?
82200,L435986,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army."
82201,L435985,u2452,m157,MARION,What news?
82202,L435969,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
82203,L435968,u2452,m157,MARION,Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
82204,L435967,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats."
82205,L435966,u2452,m157,MARION,The middle colonies?
82206,L435965,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
82207,L435942,u2452,m157,MARION,Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
82208,L435941,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside."
82209,L436566,u2456,m157,SUSAN,"Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back."
82210,L436565,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,You don't hate him.
82211,L436564,u2456,m157,SUSAN,I don't care.  I hate him.
82212,L436563,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
82213,L436562,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
82214,L436561,u2456,m157,SUSAN,He left us.
82215,L436560,u2448,m157,GABRIEL,"He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men."
82216,L436022,u2449,m157,LEE,"Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how..."
82217,L436021,u2455,m157,ROBINSON,I stand corrected.
82218,L436020,u2449,m157,LEE,"Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life."
82219,L436007,u2449,m157,LEE,"Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken."
82220,L436006,u2455,m157,ROBINSON,"Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away."
82221,L436005,u2449,m157,LEE,Please.
82222,L436004,u2455,m157,ROBINSON,"An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?"
82223,L436768,u2449,m157,LEE,Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
82224,L436767,u2452,m157,MARION,"Your son, what did you name him?"
82225,L436766,u2452,m157,MARION,I hope so.
82226,L436765,u2449,m157,LEE,Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
82227,L436764,u2452,m157,MARION,And congratulations on the birth of your son.
82228,L436763,u2452,m157,MARION,"Goodbye, Harry."
82229,L436762,u2449,m157,LEE,"Goodbye, Francis."
82230,L436711,u2449,m157,LEE,"No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice."
82231,L436710,u2452,m157,MARION,It is ended.
82232,L436709,u2449,m157,LEE,They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
82233,L436708,u2452,m157,MARION,Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
82234,L436707,u2449,m157,LEE,How many men have we seen die?
82235,L436706,u2452,m157,MARION,Don't touch him.
82236,L436692,u2449,m157,LEE,"I'm sorry, I didn't know."
82237,L436691,u2452,m157,MARION,His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
82238,L436255,u2449,m157,LEE,Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
82239,L436254,u2452,m157,MARION,How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
82240,L436253,u2449,m157,LEE,"They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be."
82241,L436252,u2452,m157,MARION,They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
82242,L436251,u2449,m157,LEE,"Not held, just slowed down."
82243,L436250,u2452,m157,MARION,You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
82244,L436249,u2449,m157,LEE,"Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks."
82245,L436248,u2452,m157,MARION,So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
82246,L436247,u2449,m157,LEE,"The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms."
82247,L436246,u2452,m157,MARION,Long time.
82248,L436245,u2449,m157,LEE,"Fall, six months at the earliest."
82249,L436244,u2452,m157,MARION,When?
82250,L436243,u2449,m157,LEE,And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
82251,L436242,u2452,m157,MARION,"So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington."
82252,L436241,u2449,m157,LEE,"We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York."
82253,L436239,u2452,m157,MARION,What are my orders?
82254,L436238,u2449,m157,LEE,"I am, I think."
82255,L436237,u2452,m157,MARION,Who's in command?
82256,L436236,u2449,m157,LEE,"Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up."
82257,L436235,u2452,m157,MARION,Where is he now?
82258,L436234,u2449,m157,LEE,I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
82259,L436233,u2452,m157,MARION,We saw.
82260,L436232,u2449,m157,LEE,"There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool."
82261,L436231,u2452,m157,MARION,I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
82262,L436230,u2449,m157,LEE,I'm sorry.
82263,L436229,u2452,m157,MARION,"Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself."
82264,L436074,u2452,m157,MARION,Thank you.
82265,L436073,u2449,m157,LEE,I'll see to it that he serves under me.
82266,L436072,u2452,m157,MARION,"No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother."
82267,L436071,u2449,m157,LEE,I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
82268,L436070,u2452,m157,MARION,Gabriel.
82269,L436069,u2449,m157,LEE,One of yours?
82270,L436048,u2452,m157,MARION,"I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles."
82271,L436047,u2449,m157,LEE,And your principles?
82272,L436046,u2452,m157,MARION,"That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead."
82273,L436045,u2449,m157,LEE,Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
82274,L436041,u2449,m157,LEE,You said bribery twice...
82275,L436040,u2452,m157,MARION,"... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery..."
82276,L436039,u2449,m157,LEE,"That's five, keep going..."
82277,L436038,u2452,m157,MARION,"Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery..."
82278,L436037,u2449,m157,LEE,Name five hundred.
82279,L436036,u2452,m157,MARION,"There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal..."
82280,L436035,u2449,m157,LEE,Balderdash!
82281,L436034,u2452,m157,MARION,We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
82282,L436033,u2449,m157,LEE,"I was an American, I just didn't know it yet..."
82283,L436032,u2452,m157,MARION,You were an Englishman then...
82284,L436030,u2449,m157,LEE,That's a damn long time...
82285,L436029,u2452,m157,MARION,Thirteen years...
82286,L436028,u2449,m157,LEE,A long time ago...
82287,L436024,u2452,m157,MARION,"Harry, Harry, Harry..."
82288,L436023,u2449,m157,LEE,"Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?"
82289,L436013,u2449,m157,LEE,I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
82290,L436012,u2452,m157,MARION,It's Mister Marion.
82291,L436011,u2449,m157,LEE,"Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot."
82292,L436483,u2450,m157,MAJOR HALBERT,Yes... you will wait.
82293,L436482,u2452,m157,MARION,"That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis."
82294,L436481,u2450,m157,MAJOR HALBERT,"Yes, quite, but you should know that..."
82295,L436480,u2452,m157,MARION,I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
82296,L436479,u2450,m157,MAJOR HALBERT,"You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that..."
82297,L436478,u2452,m157,MARION,Thank you.
82298,L436477,u2450,m157,MAJOR HALBERT,Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
82299,L436180,u2452,m157,MARION,Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
82300,L436179,u2451,m157,MARGARET,But what about Thomas?
82301,L436178,u2452,m157,MARION,"Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel."
82302,L436092,u2452,m157,MARION,"No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here."
82303,L436091,u2451,m157,MARGARET,We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
82304,L436090,u2452,m157,MARION,Don't worry.
82305,L436086,u2452,m157,MARION,"Four, five miles."
82306,L436085,u2451,m157,MARGARET,How far away?
82307,L436703,u2454,m157,REV. OLIVER,"Yes, he does."
82308,L436702,u2452,m157,MARION,"He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?"
82309,L436701,u2454,m157,REV. OLIVER,"Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and..."
82310,L436650,u2454,m157,REV. OLIVER,About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
82311,L436649,u2452,m157,MARION,How many came back?
82312,L436589,u2454,m157,REV. OLIVER,"For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part."
82313,L436588,u2452,m157,MARION,It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
82314,L436360,u2452,m157,MARION,Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
82315,L436359,u2454,m157,REV. OLIVER,For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
82316,L436358,u2452,m157,MARION,For what?
82317,L436357,u2454,m157,REV. OLIVER,Thank you.
82318,L436294,u2454,m157,REV. OLIVER,I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
82319,L436293,u2452,m157,MARION,Reverend.
82320,L436746,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,And what is the second thing?
82321,L436745,u2452,m157,MARION,"No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it."
82322,L436744,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,"If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that."
82323,L436736,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,"Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary."
82324,L436735,u2452,m157,MARION,Worse.
82325,L436734,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,That bad?
82326,L436733,u2452,m157,MARION,Remember Braddock?
82327,L436732,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,"Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis."
82328,L436725,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,"I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men."
82329,L436724,u2452,m157,MARION,"I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen."
82330,L436723,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,I was sorry to hear about your son.
82331,L436720,u2459,m157,WASHINGTON,Earned.
82332,L436719,u2452,m157,MARION,Gray.
82333,L436095,u2452,m157,MARION,Put them away.
82334,L436094,u2458,m157,THOMAS,"But father, they might come this way."
82335,L436093,u2452,m157,MARION,Put those away.
82336,L436079,u2452,m157,MARION,God willing.
82337,L436078,u2458,m157,THOMAS,But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
82338,L436077,u2452,m157,MARION,Seventeen.
82339,L436076,u2458,m157,THOMAS,When?
82340,L436075,u2452,m157,MARION,"Not yet, Thomas."
82341,L436197,u2453,m157,NATHAN,I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
82342,L436196,u2452,m157,MARION,"Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do."
82343,L436195,u2453,m157,NATHAN,Father... I killed those men...
82344,L436175,u2452,m157,MARION,Quiet.
82345,L436174,u2453,m157,NATHAN,"Father, you can't let them take him..."
82346,L436084,u2452,m157,MARION,Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
82347,L436083,u2453,m157,NATHAN,Father?
82348,L435938,u2452,m157,MARION,Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
82349,L435937,u2453,m157,NATHAN,"Father, I saw a post rider at the house."
82350,L439849,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--"
82351,L439848,u2461,m158,JUD,"Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--"
82352,L439767,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"Is that right, dad?"
82353,L439766,u2461,m158,JUD,"They do it to honor the dead, Ellen."
82354,L439548,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Yes--
82355,L439547,u2461,m158,JUD,"Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?"
82356,L439546,u2460,m158,ELLIE,What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
82357,L439543,u2461,m158,JUD,"It's a place where the dead speak, Missy."
82358,L439542,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Well...I guess not.
82359,L439541,u2461,m158,JUD,"Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?"
82360,L439532,u2461,m158,JUD,Ayuh.
82361,L439531,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Bite?
82362,L439530,u2461,m158,JUD,"Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite."
82363,L439512,u2461,m158,JUD,"You'll see soon enough, hon."
82364,L439511,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?"
82365,L439464,u2461,m158,JUD,"And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed."
82366,L439463,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to."
82367,L439462,u2461,m158,JUD,"Who might you be, little Miss?"
82368,L439942,u2464,m158,RACHEL,I will. Come and kiss me.
82369,L439941,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Please hurry.
82370,L439921,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Of course I will.
82371,L439920,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
82372,L439919,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense."
82373,L439918,u2460,m158,ELLIE,He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
82374,L439917,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
82375,L439916,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
82376,L439909,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
82377,L439908,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Ellie...Ellie...what...
82378,L439907,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Paxcow says it's almost too late!
82379,L439838,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn."
82380,L439837,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!"
82381,L439574,u2460,m158,ELLIE,But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
82382,L439573,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Honey, Church will be fine."
82383,L439438,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Yaay!
82384,L439437,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Yes, but the rope might be--"
82385,L439434,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Am I really gonna have my own room?
82386,L439433,u2464,m158,RACHEL,It's gorgeous!
82387,L439903,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I swear.
82388,L439902,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Do you swear?
82389,L439900,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--"
82390,L439899,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!"
82391,L439898,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you."
82392,L439851,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and..."
82393,L439850,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Ellie--
82394,L439808,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz."
82395,L439807,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Then why do I have to go to bed?
82396,L439806,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I'm sure you're not.
82397,L439805,u2460,m158,ELLIE,I'm not tired!
82398,L439802,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?"
82399,L439801,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"Yeah, sure."
82400,L439800,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?"
82401,L439799,u2460,m158,ELLIE,I don't get it.
82402,L439798,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Oh, faith's a little more than just believing."
82403,L439797,u2460,m158,ELLIE,You believe in it.
82404,L439796,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that."
82405,L439795,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Do you believe that?
82406,L439794,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard."
82407,L439793,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose."
82408,L439792,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--"
82409,L439791,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?"
82410,L439790,u2462,m158,LOUIS,But don't you dare say that.
82411,L439789,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear."
82412,L439788,u2460,m158,ELLIE,At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
82413,L439787,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?"
82414,L439786,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"What's up, sugar?"
82415,L439784,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
82416,L439783,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Huh?
82417,L439782,u2460,m158,ELLIE,No more chocolate chip cookies.
82418,L439781,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Ellie? What's wrong?
82419,L439772,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"That's enough, Ellen."
82420,L439771,u2460,m158,ELLIE,She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
82421,L439763,u2460,m158,ELLIE,I hate that smell.
82422,L439762,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen."
82423,L439759,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I know.
82424,L439758,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Because you promised.
82425,L439757,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Yes.
82426,L439756,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Is he really all right?
82427,L439755,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
82428,L439754,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
82429,L439708,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair."
82430,L439707,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?"
82431,L439572,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
82432,L439571,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Good God! Where'd you hear that?
82433,L439559,u2460,m158,ELLIE,It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
82434,L439558,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
82435,L439557,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?"
82436,L439556,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey..."
82437,L439555,u2460,m158,ELLIE,That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
82438,L439550,u2460,m158,ELLIE,To remember.
82439,L439549,u2462,m158,LOUIS,And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
82440,L439534,u2462,m158,LOUIS,For a little while.
82441,L439533,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"I want to look around, daddy-- may I?"
82442,L439529,u2460,m158,ELLIE,"Well, I thought it was safe--"
82443,L439528,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?"
82444,L439468,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Yayyy!
82445,L439467,u2462,m158,LOUIS,No-I guess not.
82446,L439449,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
82447,L439448,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
82448,L439436,u2460,m158,ELLIE,Yaay!
82449,L439435,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Yes.
82450,L439933,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Don't bother. I'm coming home.
82451,L439932,u2461,m158,JUD,"Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--"
82452,L439931,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Was it Pascow?
82453,L439930,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?"
82454,L439929,u2461,m158,JUD,"No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you."
82455,L439522,u2461,m158,JUD,"Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!"
82456,L439521,u2464,m158,RACHEL,How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
82457,L439466,u2461,m158,JUD,Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
82458,L439465,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you."
82459,L439461,u2461,m158,JUD,"No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night."
82460,L439460,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here."
82461,L439459,u2461,m158,JUD,Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
82462,L439869,u2461,m158,JUD,Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
82463,L439868,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?"
82464,L439866,u2461,m158,JUD,And because the dead walked.
82465,L439865,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
82466,L439864,u2461,m158,JUD,I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
82467,L439863,u2461,m158,JUD,"Ayuh--it's a mess, all right."
82468,L439862,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Shit! Look at this mess!
82469,L439861,u2461,m158,JUD,--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
82470,L439859,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I'm thinking about going to bed.
82471,L439858,u2461,m158,JUD,"You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis."
82472,L439857,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--"
82473,L439845,u2461,m158,JUD,Louis--
82474,L439844,u2462,m158,LOUIS,No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
82475,L439843,u2461,m158,JUD,"Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?"
82476,L439780,u2461,m158,JUD,Nope. He's your cat now.
82477,L439779,u2462,m158,LOUIS,It's Ellie's cat.
82478,L439778,u2461,m158,JUD,"Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?"
82479,L439777,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"My father used to have a saying, Jud-- ""God sees the truth, but waits."""
82480,L439776,u2461,m158,JUD,"Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on."
82481,L439774,u2462,m158,LOUIS,This babe has said enough.
82482,L439773,u2461,m158,JUD,"Out of the mouths of babes, Louis."
82483,L439770,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Well...a touch of the flu...
82484,L439769,u2461,m158,JUD,Rachel not feeling well?
82485,L439744,u2461,m158,JUD,Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
82486,L439743,u2462,m158,LOUIS,What?
82487,L439742,u2461,m158,JUD,"A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die."
82488,L439741,u2461,m158,JUD,"She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie."
82489,L439740,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown."
82490,L439739,u2461,m158,JUD,"Why, then, things should be fine."
82491,L439738,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Yes.
82492,L439737,u2461,m158,JUD,"Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?"
82493,L439735,u2461,m158,JUD,"Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back."
82494,L439734,u2462,m158,LOUIS,You and this old Indian rag-man--
82495,L439732,u2461,m158,JUD,"Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you..."
82496,L439731,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Wendigo?
82497,L439730,u2461,m158,JUD,They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
82498,L439728,u2461,m158,JUD,I guess it wouldn't hurt.
82499,L439727,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Can I have another one?
82500,L439726,u2461,m158,JUD,Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
82501,L439725,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?"
82502,L439724,u2461,m158,JUD,Wouldn't wash?
82503,L439723,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
82504,L439722,u2461,m158,JUD,"Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!"
82505,L439721,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"What did we do, Jud?"
82506,L439720,u2461,m158,JUD,"I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception."
82507,L439704,u2461,m158,JUD,"No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight."
82508,L439703,u2462,m158,LOUIS,But--
82509,L439697,u2461,m158,JUD,Because it's right.
82510,L439696,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Jud, why am I doing all this?"
82511,L439695,u2461,m158,JUD,Don't worry about that.
82512,L439694,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Doesn't look like they last long.
82513,L439693,u2461,m158,JUD,Your cairn.
82514,L439692,u2462,m158,LOUIS,What are those for?
82515,L439689,u2461,m158,JUD,"Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage."
82516,L439688,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin."
82517,L439687,u2461,m158,JUD,You want to rest a bit before you start?
82518,L439686,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I guess so...but...
82519,L439685,u2461,m158,JUD,"I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?"
82520,L439684,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Why? For God's sake, why?"
82521,L439683,u2461,m158,JUD,The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
82522,L439682,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Whose burying ground?
82523,L439681,u2461,m158,JUD,"This was their burying ground, Louis."
82524,L439680,u2461,m158,JUD,This time I mean it.
82525,L439679,u2462,m158,LOUIS,You keep saying that.
82526,L439678,u2461,m158,JUD,"Almost there, Louis."
82527,L439677,u2461,m158,JUD,"Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear."
82528,L439676,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"It's funny, all right."
82529,L439675,u2462,m158,LOUIS,You're telling me.
82530,L439674,u2461,m158,JUD,"There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis."
82531,L439672,u2461,m158,JUD,Ayuh.
82532,L439671,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Is there quicksand?
82533,L439670,u2461,m158,JUD,Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
82534,L439668,u2461,m158,JUD,You'll see before long. Let's go.
82535,L439667,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?"
82536,L439666,u2461,m158,JUD,"No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?"
82537,L439660,u2461,m158,JUD,Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
82538,L439659,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I'm not climbing that.
82539,L439658,u2461,m158,JUD,"No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure."
82540,L439657,u2462,m158,LOUIS,We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
82541,L439656,u2461,m158,JUD,The place we're going is on the other side of that.
82542,L439655,u2462,m158,LOUIS,What do you mean?
82543,L439654,u2461,m158,JUD,We're still not where we're going.
82544,L439653,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
82545,L439652,u2461,m158,JUD,"What say, Louis?"
82546,L439650,u2461,m158,JUD,Then come on.
82547,L439649,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Yes, but--"
82548,L439648,u2461,m158,JUD,Does she love the cat?
82549,L439647,u2462,m158,LOUIS,But--
82550,L439646,u2461,m158,JUD,"It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to."
82551,L439645,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back."
82552,L439644,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
82553,L439643,u2461,m158,JUD,No need to apologize.
82554,L439641,u2461,m158,JUD,Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
82555,L439640,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I don't know.
82556,L439639,u2461,m158,JUD,Going to tell Ellie?
82557,L439638,u2461,m158,JUD,You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
82558,L439637,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Bagged cat. What a mess.
82559,L439636,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Yes.
82560,L439635,u2461,m158,JUD,"Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?"
82561,L439634,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty."
82562,L439633,u2461,m158,JUD,I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
82563,L439632,u2462,m158,LOUIS,It's Church.
82564,L439631,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus."
82565,L439630,u2461,m158,JUD,"Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's."
82566,L439629,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?"
82567,L439628,u2461,m158,JUD,Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
82568,L439553,u2461,m158,JUD,Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
82569,L439552,u2462,m158,LOUIS,My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
82570,L439545,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I think it is so, Ellie."
82571,L439544,u2461,m158,JUD,"No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?"
82572,L439536,u2461,m158,JUD,"Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!"
82573,L439535,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I can hardly read these.
82574,L439516,u2461,m158,JUD,"Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile."
82575,L439515,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Not yet...how much further is it?
82576,L439514,u2461,m158,JUD,Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
82577,L439513,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
82578,L439510,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Sure.
82579,L439509,u2461,m158,JUD,You folks ready to go on?
82580,L439502,u2462,m158,LOUIS,What's at the end of it?
82581,L439501,u2461,m158,JUD,That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
82582,L439500,u2462,m158,LOUIS,The one that goes into the woods--sure.
82583,L439499,u2461,m158,JUD,"I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one."
82584,L439498,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Nice.
82585,L439495,u2461,m158,JUD,"The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis."
82586,L439494,u2462,m158,LOUIS,What?
82587,L439493,u2461,m158,JUD,Allman Brothers.
82588,L439492,u2462,m158,LOUIS,What were you listening to?
82589,L439491,u2461,m158,JUD,"Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself."
82590,L439490,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"God, that's fine."
82591,L439489,u2461,m158,JUD,Good for you.
82592,L439488,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Not at all.
82593,L439487,u2461,m158,JUD,You need a glass?
82594,L439472,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Well, maybe I----"
82595,L439471,u2461,m158,JUD,"Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want."
82596,L439470,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Hey--they actually found the place!
82597,L439914,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
82598,L439913,u2463,m158,PASCOW,Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
82599,L439912,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong."
82600,L439747,u2462,m158,LOUIS,You don't understand--
82601,L439746,u2463,m158,PASCOW,The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
82602,L439624,u2463,m158,PASCOW,Remember.
82603,L439623,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Leave me alone!
82604,L439622,u2463,m158,PASCOW,"The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc."
82605,L439621,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--"
82606,L439620,u2463,m158,PASCOW,"The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know."
82607,L439619,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--"
82608,L439890,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I'm sure.
82609,L439889,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Louis, are you sure?"
82610,L439888,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy."
82611,L439887,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--"
82612,L439886,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"You better get going, hon."
82613,L439819,u2462,m158,LOUIS,You're doing fine.
82614,L439818,u2464,m158,RACHEL,I'm going to try to do better.
82615,L439817,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Yes, I guess I do."
82616,L439816,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know."
82617,L439815,u2462,m158,LOUIS,That's forgotten.
82618,L439814,u2464,m158,RACHEL,I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
82619,L439811,u2464,m158,RACHEL,That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
82620,L439810,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
82621,L439809,u2464,m158,RACHEL,I heard you tonight.
82622,L439627,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Good d--
82623,L439626,u2464,m158,RACHEL,I got eggs down here!
82624,L439625,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Getting there.
82625,L439586,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her."
82626,L439585,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Thank you, Louis."
82627,L439583,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise."
82628,L439582,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Well, honey...you know that..."
82629,L439581,u2462,m158,LOUIS,And Church will be fine.
82630,L439580,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face."
82631,L439579,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place."
82632,L439578,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I just said--
82633,L439577,u2464,m158,RACHEL,That's enough of that kind of talk!
82634,L439576,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks."
82635,L439575,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
82636,L439565,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die."
82637,L439564,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?"
82638,L439563,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it."
82639,L439562,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid."
82640,L439561,u2464,m158,RACHEL,She's finally asleep.
82641,L439524,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Extraordinarily morbid, maybe."
82642,L439523,u2462,m158,LOUIS,I think it's rather extraordinary.
82643,L439508,u2464,m158,RACHEL,It's beautiful!
82644,L439507,u2462,m158,LOUIS,My God!
82645,L439483,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Did you see his shirt?
82646,L439482,u2464,m158,RACHEL,---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
82647,L439481,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---"
82648,L439480,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?"
82649,L439477,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow."
82650,L439476,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?"
82651,L439475,u2462,m158,LOUIS,The movers--
82652,L439458,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
82653,L439457,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Thank you. Thank you so much.
82654,L439454,u2462,m158,LOUIS,"Jesus, the road!"
82655,L439453,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Gage's gone!
82656,L439443,u2464,m158,RACHEL,Come on--let's parole 'em.
82657,L439442,u2462,m158,LOUIS,And Buckaroo Banzai.
82658,L439440,u2464,m158,RACHEL,"Louis, the house is beautiful."
82659,L439439,u2462,m158,LOUIS,Let her go. It's cool.
82660,L442427,u2470,m159,JACK,"Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!"
82661,L442426,u2465,m159,ANAMARIA,"Aye, aye, sir!"
82662,L442425,u2470,m159,JACK,"AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!"
82663,L442088,u2470,m159,JACK,"They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --"
82664,L442087,u2465,m159,ANAMARIA,How does he do that?
82665,L442020,u2465,m159,ANAMARIA,I will.
82666,L442019,u2470,m159,JACK,You'll get it back.  Or one better.
82667,L442018,u2465,m159,ANAMARIA,That boat is my livelihood!
82668,L442017,u2470,m159,JACK,Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
82669,L442016,u2465,m159,ANAMARIA,My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
82670,L442014,u2470,m159,JACK,AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
82671,L442013,u2465,m159,ANAMARIA,You stole my boat.
82672,L442403,u2476,m159,WILL,He didn't waste it.
82673,L442402,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot."
82674,L442214,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where."
82675,L442213,u2476,m159,WILL,No!  You gave your word!
82676,L442208,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul."
82677,L442207,u2476,m159,WILL,You must swear by the Holy Bible.
82678,L442204,u2476,m159,WILL,And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
82679,L442203,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,We got that part.  Anything else?
82680,L442202,u2476,m159,WILL,Elizabeth goes free!
82681,L442201,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Enough of that!  Name your terms.
82682,L442194,u2476,m159,WILL,You can't.  I can.
82683,L442193,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
82684,L442192,u2476,m159,WILL,She.  Goes.  Free.
82685,L442191,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"What's in your head, boy?"
82686,L442400,u2470,m159,JACK,Or you could surrender.
82687,L442399,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?"
82688,L442394,u2470,m159,JACK,Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
82689,L442393,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool."
82690,L442375,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Aye, for us there is."
82691,L442374,u2470,m159,JACK,There's ... another exit?
82692,L442372,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Men!  Are you up for it?
82693,L442371,u2470,m159,JACK,"Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?"
82694,L442369,u2470,m159,JACK,"Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?"
82695,L442368,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,That so?
82696,L442367,u2470,m159,JACK,The situation has changed.
82697,L442366,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you."
82698,L442365,u2470,m159,JACK,Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
82699,L442363,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,What're you suggesting?
82700,L442362,u2470,m159,JACK,"You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal."
82701,L442357,u2470,m159,JACK,"Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor."
82702,L442356,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Why don't I want to do this?
82703,L442355,u2470,m159,JACK,All right then.
82704,L442354,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"No, I really think I do."
82705,L442226,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,That's fair.
82706,L442225,u2470,m159,JACK,You can go to your grave not knowing.
82707,L442224,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"So how did you get off that island, anyway?"
82708,L442219,u2470,m159,JACK,"The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot."
82709,L442218,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"You'd best take a swim, Jack."
82710,L442217,u2470,m159,JACK,"Someone needs to cut these bonds, then."
82711,L442216,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better."
82712,L442215,u2470,m159,JACK,"It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it."
82713,L442164,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course."
82714,L442163,u2470,m159,JACK,I'll watch my back.
82715,L442162,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside."
82716,L442161,u2470,m159,JACK,What -- you don't have the medallion?
82717,L442159,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain."
82718,L442158,u2470,m159,JACK,"See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want."
82719,L442157,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that."
82720,L442155,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Track you down and --
82721,L442154,u2470,m159,JACK,Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
82722,L442153,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!"
82723,L442152,u2470,m159,JACK,Wait as long as you like.
82724,L442151,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
82725,L442150,u2470,m159,JACK,You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
82726,L442149,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,I'll torture it out of you.
82727,L442148,u2470,m159,JACK,"You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice."
82728,L442146,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,I'm supposed to ... trust you?
82729,L442145,u2470,m159,JACK,That's right.
82730,L442144,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?"
82731,L442143,u2470,m159,JACK,You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
82732,L442142,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?"
82733,L442141,u2470,m159,JACK,Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
82734,L442140,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
82735,L442137,u2470,m159,JACK,No you won't.
82736,L442136,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Say the name, or I slit your throat."
82737,L442135,u2470,m159,JACK,"I know whose blood you need, to end the curse."
82738,L442361,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
82739,L442360,u2474,m159,PINTEL,Do you believe him?
82740,L442339,u2474,m159,PINTEL,I guess there is a reason to fret.
82741,L442338,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all."
82742,L442337,u2474,m159,PINTEL,No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
82743,L442221,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!"
82744,L442220,u2474,m159,PINTEL,"That's proper, sir, according to the code."
82745,L442200,u2474,m159,PINTEL,"And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!"
82746,L442199,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
82747,L442139,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Now.  No, don't kill him."
82748,L442138,u2474,m159,PINTEL,Now?
82749,L442206,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Will -- you can't trust him.
82750,L442205,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --"
82751,L442090,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer."
82752,L442089,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,The curse drove you to gather this?
82753,L441974,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
82754,L441973,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,It's a pirate medallion.
82755,L441972,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Do you not know what this is, then?"
82756,L441971,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,Would that I could.
82757,L441970,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Then why aren't you eating?
82758,L441969,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner."
82759,L441964,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Now, none of that.  Please dig in."
82760,L441963,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
82761,L441962,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Maid or not, it fits you."
82762,L441862,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!"
82763,L441861,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Can I trust you?
82764,L441860,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return."
82765,L441859,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean."
82766,L441858,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?"
82767,L441857,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Thank you, sir."
82768,L441856,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"You've got sand, for a maid."
82769,L441855,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household.
82770,L441854,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"You have a name, missy?"
82771,L441851,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"Did you, now?"
82772,L441850,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England."
82773,L441849,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
82774,L441848,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,I'll drop it!
82775,L441847,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Very well.
82776,L441846,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
82777,L441845,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,I want you to leave.  And never come back.
82778,L441844,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?"
82779,L441843,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
82780,L441842,u2466,m159,BARBOSSA,"My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?"
82781,L442309,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!"
82782,L442308,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,That would hardly be proper.
82783,L442307,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Then I can wear men's clothing.
82784,L442306,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
82785,L442304,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,I know where your heart truly lies.
82786,L442303,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,What?
82787,L442302,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal."
82788,L442299,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Not as a condition -- a request.
82789,L442298,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
82790,L442297,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift."
82791,L442294,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Commodore, please!"
82792,L442293,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
82793,L442292,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,No.  The pirates have taken Will --
82794,L442289,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
82795,L442288,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,You're speaking up for him again?
82796,L442287,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Commodore, you can't do that!"
82797,L442286,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time."
82798,L441758,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him."
82799,L441757,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --"
82800,L441744,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
82801,L441743,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life."
82802,L441712,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"I'm a bit nervous, myself --"
82803,L441711,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,I can't breathe.
82804,L441710,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth."
82805,L441623,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Very good.
82806,L441622,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
82807,L441621,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Did he speak?
82808,L441607,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
82809,L441606,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Boy overboard!
82810,L441605,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Man overboard!
82811,L441597,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop."
82812,L441596,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
82813,L441650,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,About the day we met. Do you remember?
82814,L441649,u2475,m159,SWANN,"Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --"
82815,L441638,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
82816,L441637,u2475,m159,SWANN,I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
82817,L441636,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Difficult ... to say.
82818,L441634,u2475,m159,SWANN,"Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know."
82819,L441633,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,I knew it.
82820,L441632,u2475,m159,SWANN,Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
82821,L441631,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Ceremony?
82822,L441630,u2475,m159,SWANN,Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
82823,L441629,u2475,m159,SWANN,Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
82824,L441628,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
82825,L441625,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Yes -- yes.
82826,L441624,u2475,m159,SWANN,Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
82827,L441602,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Yes, father."
82828,L441601,u2475,m159,SWANN,"And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?"
82829,L441600,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Actually, I find it all fascinating."
82830,L441960,u2474,m159,PINTEL,"He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked."
82831,L441959,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
82832,L441958,u2474,m159,PINTEL,"You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this."
82833,L441819,u2474,m159,PINTEL,"It would appear, so do you."
82834,L441818,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete."
82835,L441817,u2474,m159,PINTEL,I know the code.
82836,L441816,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!"
82837,L441815,u2474,m159,PINTEL,What?
82838,L442413,u2476,m159,WILL,-- but that was not a proper kiss.
82839,L442412,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,It doesn't!
82840,L442411,u2476,m159,WILL,"Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --"
82841,L442410,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
82842,L442172,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
82843,L442171,u2476,m159,WILL,I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
82844,L442170,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,-- then we never would have met.
82845,L442169,u2476,m159,WILL,If I had known --
82846,L442168,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock."
82847,L442167,u2476,m159,WILL,Why would my father send this to me?
82848,L442123,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
82849,L442122,u2476,m159,WILL,I'm glad we got here in time.
82850,L441653,u2476,m159,WILL,"At least once more, Miss Swann. As always."
82851,L441652,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?"
82852,L441651,u2476,m159,WILL,"I could never forget it, Miss Swann."
82853,L442324,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,What's your plan?
82854,L442323,u2470,m159,JACK,"I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided."
82855,L442322,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
82856,L442321,u2470,m159,JACK,Exactly.
82857,L442320,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
82858,L442319,u2470,m159,JACK,"Nor did you, I noticed."
82859,L442318,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
82860,L442283,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Exactly.
82861,L442282,u2470,m159,JACK,"You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?"
82862,L442281,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?"
82863,L442280,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --"
82864,L442279,u2470,m159,JACK,Why?
82865,L442278,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Yes, the rum is gone."
82866,L442277,u2470,m159,JACK,"What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!"
82867,L442276,u2470,m159,JACK,To the Black Pearl.
82868,L442275,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,To freedom.
82869,L442274,u2470,m159,JACK,We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
82870,L442273,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
82871,L442272,u2470,m159,JACK,"Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved."
82872,L442271,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again."
82873,L442269,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
82874,L442268,u2470,m159,JACK,"When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!"
82875,L442262,u2470,m159,JACK,More to drink!
82876,L442261,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ..."
82877,L442260,u2470,m159,JACK,Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
82878,L442259,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"That was before I met one, of course."
82879,L442258,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --"
82880,L442257,u2470,m159,JACK,"I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it."
82881,L442256,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
82882,L442255,u2470,m159,JACK,"What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please."
82883,L442254,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Drink up me hearties, yo ho ..."
82884,L442251,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,"Not when you can drink instead, at least."
82885,L442250,u2470,m159,JACK,"Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about."
82886,L442249,u2470,m159,JACK,"You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner."
82887,L442248,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
82888,L442247,u2470,m159,JACK,"You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair."
82889,L442246,u2470,m159,JACK,"Welcome to the Caribbean, love."
82890,L442245,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
82891,L442244,u2470,m159,JACK,"Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that."
82892,L442243,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,But ... you did it before!  Last time --
82893,L442242,u2470,m159,JACK,"It won't.  It won't, and so we won't."
82894,L442241,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
82895,L442239,u2470,m159,JACK,Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
82896,L442238,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
82897,L442235,u2470,m159,JACK,The trees are taller.
82898,L442234,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Has it changed since the last time you were here?
82899,L442126,u2470,m159,JACK,"No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on."
82900,L442125,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Come on!
82901,L442118,u2470,m159,JACK,"No, I'm -- rescuing you."
82902,L442117,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,You're in league with Barbossa!
82903,L442116,u2470,m159,JACK,Me!
82904,L442115,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,You?!
82905,L441755,u2470,m159,JACK,I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
82906,L441754,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,You are despicable.
82907,L441752,u2470,m159,JACK,"Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?"
82908,L441751,u2467,m159,ELIZABETH,Miss Swann.
82909,L442078,u2470,m159,JACK,"Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold."
82910,L442077,u2468,m159,GIBBS,How did you get off the island?
82911,L442059,u2470,m159,JACK,We're catching up!
82912,L442058,u2468,m159,GIBBS,What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
82913,L442057,u2470,m159,JACK,She can hold a bit longer.
82914,L442056,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"We'd best drop canvas, sir!"
82915,L442044,u2470,m159,JACK,That he is.
82916,L442043,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?"
82917,L442040,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"And you've got that, have you?"
82918,L442039,u2470,m159,JACK,Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
82919,L442038,u2468,m159,GIBBS,A fool's errand.
82920,L442037,u2470,m159,JACK,"Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew."
82921,L442036,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl."
82922,L442035,u2470,m159,JACK,"I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it."
82923,L442034,u2468,m159,GIBBS,Say again?
82924,L442032,u2470,m159,JACK,"Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?"
82925,L442031,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx."
82926,L442030,u2470,m159,JACK,First -- have you found me a crew?
82927,L442029,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?"
82928,L442025,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Aye, that'll about do it."
82929,L442024,u2470,m159,JACK,"Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition."
82930,L442023,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!"
82931,L442188,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight."
82932,L442187,u2476,m159,WILL,We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
82933,L442186,u2468,m159,GIBBS,That we are.
82934,L442185,u2476,m159,WILL,We're not going to just surrender!
82935,L442184,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well."
82936,L442074,u2476,m159,WILL,How did he get off the island?
82937,L442073,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die."
82938,L442072,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny."
82939,L442071,u2476,m159,WILL,What?  He never told me that.
82940,L442070,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --"
82941,L442069,u2476,m159,WILL,Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
82942,L442068,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay."
82943,L442067,u2476,m159,WILL,How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
82944,L442027,u2476,m159,WILL,I know.  That was for the smell.
82945,L442026,u2468,m159,GIBBS,"Blast it, I'm already awake!"
82946,L442422,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,I don't think that will be necessary.
82947,L442421,u2469,m159,GILLETTE,Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
82948,L442384,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
82949,L442383,u2469,m159,GILLETTE,"All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire."
82950,L441952,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
82951,L441951,u2469,m159,GILLETTE,Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
82952,L441950,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines."
82953,L441949,u2469,m159,GILLETTE,"The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them."
82954,L441948,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Raise the sails.
82955,L441927,u2470,m159,JACK,"As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!"
82956,L441926,u2469,m159,GILLETTE,"Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir."
82957,L441925,u2470,m159,JACK,"Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound."
82958,L441924,u2469,m159,GILLETTE,"Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise."
82959,L441923,u2470,m159,JACK,We'll see about that.
82960,L441922,u2469,m159,GILLETTE,You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
82961,L441921,u2470,m159,JACK,Dead serious.
82962,L441702,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,"I said, no lies."
82963,L441701,u2470,m159,JACK,"None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating."
82964,L441698,u2470,m159,JACK,Smith.
82965,L441697,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,What's your name?
82966,L441676,u2470,m159,JACK,"That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?"
82967,L441675,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,"Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed."
82968,L441674,u2470,m159,JACK,"That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous."
82969,L441668,u2470,m159,JACK,This must be some important boat.
82970,L441667,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
82971,L441666,u2470,m159,JACK,"Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?"
82972,L441665,u2470,m159,JACK,"Sorry, I didn't know."
82973,L441664,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,This dock is off-limits to civilians.
82974,L442336,u2470,m159,JACK,"I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them."
82975,L442335,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,I'll be at the wheel myself.
82976,L442334,u2470,m159,JACK,"That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is."
82977,L442333,u2470,m159,JACK,I knew you'd listen to reason!
82978,L442332,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
82979,L442331,u2470,m159,JACK,They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
82980,L442330,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,You would do that?
82981,L442329,u2470,m159,JACK,"Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you."
82982,L442328,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage."
82983,L442296,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"By remembering that I serve others, not only myself."
82984,L442295,u2470,m159,JACK,"Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?"
82985,L442291,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta."
82986,L442290,u2470,m159,JACK,We had time to get to know each other.
82987,L441746,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Indeed.
82988,L441745,u2470,m159,JACK,But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
82989,L441741,u2470,m159,JACK,"Ah, but you have heard of me."
82990,L441740,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of."
82991,L441733,u2470,m159,JACK,Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
82992,L441732,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?"
82993,L442405,u2470,m159,JACK,"The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate."
82994,L442404,u2476,m159,WILL,"Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?"
82995,L442359,u2470,m159,JACK,-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
82996,L442358,u2476,m159,WILL,Jack!
82997,L442348,u2470,m159,JACK,It's the right way.
82998,L442347,u2476,m159,WILL,Are you certain this is the right way?
82999,L442346,u2470,m159,JACK,Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
83000,L442345,u2476,m159,WILL,Jack!
83001,L442344,u2470,m159,JACK,Do you have any idea where you're going?
83002,L442197,u2476,m159,WILL,"My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!"
83003,L442196,u2470,m159,JACK,Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
83004,L442131,u2470,m159,JACK,"I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little."
83005,L442130,u2476,m159,WILL,Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
83006,L442129,u2470,m159,JACK,"Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy."
83007,L442128,u2470,m159,JACK,I'll lead them away.
83008,L442127,u2476,m159,WILL,No.
83009,L442121,u2470,m159,JACK,This way!
83010,L442120,u2476,m159,WILL,Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
83011,L442094,u2470,m159,JACK,"On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --"
83012,L442093,u2476,m159,WILL,On what?
83013,L442092,u2470,m159,JACK,Depends.
83014,L442091,u2476,m159,WILL,What's that?
83015,L442082,u2476,m159,WILL,Barbossa.
83016,L442081,u2470,m159,JACK,But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
83017,L442080,u2470,m159,JACK,"The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good."
83018,L442079,u2476,m159,WILL,Wait -- what about the pistol?
83019,L442054,u2470,m159,JACK,These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
83020,L442053,u2476,m159,WILL,"Shut up, before you lose them all!"
83021,L442012,u2470,m159,JACK,Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
83022,L442011,u2476,m159,WILL,Just do it quickly.
83023,L442009,u2470,m159,JACK,Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
83024,L442008,u2476,m159,WILL,Tortuga?
83025,L442005,u2470,m159,JACK,"Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?"
83026,L442004,u2476,m159,WILL,"You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you."
83027,L442003,u2470,m159,JACK,"Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again."
83028,L442002,u2476,m159,WILL,My father -- was not -- a pirate!
83029,L442001,u2470,m159,JACK,Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
83030,L442000,u2476,m159,WILL,My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
83031,L441999,u2470,m159,JACK,"You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'"
83032,L441998,u2476,m159,WILL,"He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--"
83033,L441997,u2470,m159,JACK,Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
83034,L441996,u2476,m159,WILL,It's not true my father was a pirate.
83035,L441995,u2470,m159,JACK,"I swear, you look just like him."
83036,L441994,u2476,m159,WILL,That's not true.
83037,L441993,u2470,m159,JACK,"Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin."
83038,L441992,u2476,m159,WILL,'Bootstrap?'
83039,L441991,u2470,m159,JACK,"I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill."
83040,L441989,u2476,m159,WILL,My father.  William Turner?
83041,L441988,u2470,m159,JACK,Is that so?
83042,L441987,u2476,m159,WILL,"I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father."
83043,L441986,u2470,m159,JACK,"For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study."
83044,L441919,u2476,m159,WILL,Aye!  Avast!
83045,L441918,u2470,m159,JACK,Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
83046,L441917,u2470,m159,JACK,Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
83047,L441916,u2476,m159,WILL,"This is either crazy, or brilliant."
83048,L441915,u2470,m159,JACK,"So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it."
83049,L441914,u2476,m159,WILL,It's still against the law.
83050,L441913,u2470,m159,JACK,Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
83051,L441912,u2476,m159,WILL,We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
83052,L441910,u2470,m159,JACK,No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
83053,L441909,u2476,m159,WILL,"I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy."
83054,L441908,u2470,m159,JACK,Come aboard.
83055,L441905,u2470,m159,JACK,Good.
83056,L441904,u2476,m159,WILL,I'd die for her.
83057,L441903,u2470,m159,JACK,"My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?"
83058,L441902,u2476,m159,WILL,Why are brothering with that?
83059,L441901,u2476,m159,WILL,We need to go!
83060,L441900,u2470,m159,JACK,Not without my effects.
83061,L441898,u2470,m159,JACK,Agreed!
83062,L441897,u2476,m159,WILL,Agreed.
83063,L441893,u2476,m159,WILL,"I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ..."
83064,L441892,u2470,m159,JACK,How?  The key's run off.
83065,L441891,u2476,m159,WILL,I can get you out of here.
83066,L441890,u2470,m159,JACK,"So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me."
83067,L441889,u2476,m159,WILL,Never.  They took Miss Swann.
83068,L441888,u2470,m159,JACK,And you want to turn pirate yourself?
83069,L441887,u2476,m159,WILL,Because you're a pirate.
83070,L441886,u2470,m159,JACK,Why ask me?
83071,L441885,u2476,m159,WILL,The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
83072,L441884,u2470,m159,JACK,Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
83073,L441883,u2476,m159,WILL,Where does it make berth?
83074,L441882,u2470,m159,JACK,Somewhat.
83075,L441881,u2476,m159,WILL,Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
83076,L441783,u2476,m159,WILL,No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
83077,L441782,u2470,m159,JACK,Move!
83078,L441781,u2476,m159,WILL,No.
83079,L441780,u2470,m159,JACK,Move away.
83080,L441779,u2470,m159,JACK,Pirate.
83081,L441778,u2476,m159,WILL,You cheated.
83082,L441776,u2470,m159,JACK,You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
83083,L441775,u2476,m159,WILL,I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
83084,L441774,u2470,m159,JACK,Who makes all these?
83085,L441769,u2470,m159,JACK,Only a little.
83086,L441768,u2476,m159,WILL,You threatened Miss Swann.
83087,L441767,u2470,m159,JACK,"Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?"
83088,L441766,u2470,m159,JACK,Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
83089,L441765,u2476,m159,WILL,I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
83090,L441764,u2470,m159,JACK,You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
83091,L441874,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,Still --
83092,L441873,u2471,m159,MULLROY,"Mentioned it, is more what he did."
83093,L441872,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
83094,L441706,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
83095,L441705,u2471,m159,MULLROY,He may be.
83096,L441704,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,He's not telling the truth.
83097,L441703,u2471,m159,MULLROY,I think he's telling the truth.
83098,L441700,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,And no lies!
83099,L441699,u2471,m159,MULLROY,"What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?"
83100,L441693,u2471,m159,MULLROY,"Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!"
83101,L441692,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,... no.
83102,L441691,u2471,m159,MULLROY,"Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?"
83103,L441690,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,But I've seen a ship with black sails.
83104,L441689,u2471,m159,MULLROY,No.
83105,L441688,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,... No.
83106,L441687,u2471,m159,MULLROY,You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
83107,L441686,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,"Yes, I have."
83108,L441685,u2471,m159,MULLROY,You haven't seen it.
83109,L441684,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,Yes.
83110,L441683,u2471,m159,MULLROY,You've seen the Black Pearl?
83111,L441682,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,Yes.
83112,L441681,u2471,m159,MULLROY,You've seen it?
83113,L441680,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,Yes it is.  I've seen it.
83114,L441679,u2471,m159,MULLROY,"No, it's not."
83115,L441678,u2472,m159,MURTOGG,The Black Pearl is a real ship.
83116,L441677,u2471,m159,MULLROY,There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
83117,L441938,u2475,m159,SWANN,"Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!"
83118,L441937,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Please.
83119,L441936,u2475,m159,SWANN,But --
83120,L441935,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,A moment.
83121,L441934,u2475,m159,SWANN,Commodore --
83122,L441796,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,Bleak.  Very bleak.
83123,L441795,u2475,m159,SWANN,"Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight."
83124,L441794,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,No.  She hasn't.
83125,L441793,u2475,m159,SWANN,Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
83126,L441612,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
83127,L441611,u2475,m159,SWANN,What happened here?
83128,L441609,u2475,m159,SWANN,Where did he come from?
83129,L441608,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,He's still breathing.
83130,L441599,u2473,m159,NORRINGTON,"My apologies, Governor."
83131,L441598,u2475,m159,SWANN,"Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter."
83132,L444537,u2483,m160,SIM,No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
83133,L444536,u2477,m160,ARGON,Have you found Dr. Bright?
83134,L444535,u2483,m160,SIM,"Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible."
83135,L444523,u2483,m160,SIM,Dr. Bright has escaped.
83136,L444522,u2477,m160,ARGON,Speak.
83137,L444521,u2483,m160,SIM,"Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem."
83138,L444076,u2483,m160,SIM,"You got it, Dr. Argon."
83139,L444075,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?"
83140,L443995,u2477,m160,ARGON,Until he's done.
83141,L443994,u2483,m160,SIM,How long do you leave him in there?
83142,L444463,u2477,m160,ARGON,"A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all."
83143,L444462,u2484,m160,SUSAN,What did you use?
83144,L444460,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you."
83145,L444459,u2484,m160,SUSAN,What are you going to do to him?
83146,L444369,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want."
83147,L444368,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build."
83148,L444361,u2477,m160,ARGON,"I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this..."
83149,L444360,u2484,m160,SUSAN,How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
83150,L444359,u2477,m160,ARGON,"This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection."
83151,L444358,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing."
83152,L444357,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Pollution?
83153,L444355,u2477,m160,ARGON,"I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?"
83154,L444354,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
83155,L444353,u2477,m160,ARGON,"I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going."
83156,L444351,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
83157,L444350,u2477,m160,ARGON,"We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?"
83158,L444342,u2477,m160,ARGON,You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
83159,L444341,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"No, thank you."
83160,L444340,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Something to drink, Dr. Bright?"
83161,L444339,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something."
83162,L444338,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You can't mean that.
83163,L444337,u2477,m160,ARGON,"To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that."
83164,L444336,u2484,m160,SUSAN,But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
83165,L444335,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything."
83166,L444306,u2484,m160,SUSAN,No.
83167,L444305,u2477,m160,ARGON,Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
83168,L444300,u2477,m160,ARGON,You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
83169,L444299,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself."
83170,L444298,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that."
83171,L444285,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation."
83172,L444284,u2477,m160,ARGON,Wheelchair accessible.
83173,L444625,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
83174,L444624,u2477,m160,ARGON,"You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!"
83175,L444623,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --"
83176,L444622,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!"
83177,L444614,u2477,m160,ARGON,You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
83178,L444613,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You mean besides kicking your ass?!
83179,L444612,u2477,m160,ARGON,I know what you're doing.
83180,L444600,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
83181,L444599,u2477,m160,ARGON,It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
83182,L444598,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were."
83183,L444597,u2477,m160,ARGON,"As you can see I am a new man, just like you."
83184,L444596,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Ain't it.
83185,L444595,u2477,m160,ARGON,How apropos.
83186,L444453,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Maybe you should, but you can't."
83187,L444452,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
83188,L444297,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
83189,L444296,u2477,m160,ARGON,"The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her."
83190,L444293,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant."
83191,L444292,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien."
83192,L444291,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison."
83193,L444290,u2477,m160,ARGON,... plastic.
83194,L444287,u2477,m160,ARGON,"If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you."
83195,L444286,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
83196,L444584,u2477,m160,ARGON,Not that.
83197,L444583,u2482,m160,POPPY,Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
83198,L444582,u2477,m160,ARGON,Did you feel that?
83199,L444483,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Poppy, this is not the time!"
83200,L444482,u2482,m160,POPPY,If you loved me like I loved you?
83201,L444481,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Poppy, please --"
83202,L444480,u2482,m160,POPPY,What I asked you earlier?
83203,L444479,u2477,m160,ARGON,Considering what?
83204,L444478,u2482,m160,POPPY,I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
83205,L444477,u2482,m160,POPPY,"I'm so excited, Icarus."
83206,L444476,u2477,m160,ARGON,It will be an ascension.
83207,L444473,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Okay, arms up, lean forward."
83208,L444472,u2477,m160,ARGON,"This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold."
83209,L444471,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it."
83210,L444470,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?"
83211,L444425,u2477,m160,ARGON,"If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me."
83212,L444424,u2482,m160,POPPY,Consideration?
83213,L444423,u2477,m160,ARGON,"I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration."
83214,L444422,u2482,m160,POPPY,Icarus?
83215,L444417,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Poppy, please, just tell me what you want."
83216,L444416,u2482,m160,POPPY,Then you still love me?
83217,L444415,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Yes.  Yes, of course it is."
83218,L444414,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?"
83219,L444413,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Icarus, please!  This is important!"
83220,L444412,u2477,m160,ARGON,Why are there two ottomans?
83221,L444411,u2482,m160,POPPY,You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
83222,L444409,u2482,m160,POPPY,"No, Icky, this is real."
83223,L444408,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?"
83224,L444406,u2477,m160,ARGON,"She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him."
83225,L444405,u2482,m160,POPPY,Do you think she loves him?
83226,L444404,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable."
83227,L444403,u2482,m160,POPPY,And you still believe he's going to come here?
83228,L444402,u2477,m160,ARGON,That remains to be seen.
83229,L444401,u2482,m160,POPPY,And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
83230,L444400,u2477,m160,ARGON,Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
83231,L444399,u2482,m160,POPPY,Do you think she will give us the designs?
83232,L444332,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?"
83233,L444331,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Gently, Ott.  Gently."
83234,L444032,u2477,m160,ARGON,You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
83235,L444031,u2482,m160,POPPY,A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
83236,L444013,u2482,m160,POPPY,Nebbleman.
83237,L444012,u2477,m160,ARGON,Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
83238,L444011,u2482,m160,POPPY,"In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright."
83239,L444010,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable."
83240,L444009,u2482,m160,POPPY,You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
83241,L444008,u2477,m160,ARGON,"But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --"
83242,L444007,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control."
83243,L444006,u2477,m160,ARGON,"It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!"
83244,L444003,u2477,m160,ARGON,Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
83245,L444002,u2482,m160,POPPY,Icky!  What's happening?
83246,L443868,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory."
83247,L443867,u2477,m160,ARGON,She let it escape because she wants me to die.
83248,L443866,u2482,m160,POPPY,She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
83249,L443865,u2477,m160,ARGON,She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
83250,L443864,u2482,m160,POPPY,She says it's not.
83251,L443863,u2477,m160,ARGON,"It's ready now, I know it is."
83252,L443862,u2482,m160,POPPY,"She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon."
83253,L443859,u2477,m160,ARGON,No.  I'm getting used to it.
83254,L443858,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so."
83255,L443857,u2477,m160,ARGON,Oh no?  Smell this.
83256,L443856,u2482,m160,POPPY,You're not rotting meat.
83257,L443855,u2477,m160,ARGON,Like rotting meat.
83258,L444542,u2477,m160,ARGON,Donated to science.  Perfect.
83259,L444541,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?"
83260,L444540,u2477,m160,ARGON,It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
83261,L444532,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Thank you, sir."
83262,L444531,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself."
83263,L444498,u2477,m160,ARGON,Shut up and do it!
83264,L444497,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --"
83265,L444367,u2477,m160,ARGON,"In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do."
83266,L444366,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours."
83267,L444365,u2477,m160,ARGON,Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
83268,L444364,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
83269,L444311,u2477,m160,ARGON,The trunk.
83270,L444310,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Where did he go?
83271,L444304,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them."
83272,L444303,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
83273,L444200,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here."
83274,L444199,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --"
83275,L444030,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew."
83276,L444029,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,That might work.
83277,L444028,u2477,m160,ARGON,Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
83278,L444027,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures."
83279,L444026,u2477,m160,ARGON,"Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?"
83280,L444025,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
83281,L444024,u2477,m160,ARGON,"The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up."
83282,L444021,u2477,m160,ARGON,The nanobot is gone.
83283,L444020,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem."
83284,L443991,u2478,m160,KID,I want Trix!  Mommy!
83285,L443990,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?"
83286,L443986,u2478,m160,KID,I like Trix!
83287,L443985,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
83288,L443984,u2478,m160,KID,"Yeah, I do!"
83289,L443983,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You don't want this.
83290,L443982,u2478,m160,KID,Hey!
83291,L443899,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I'll do whatever I have to do.
83292,L443898,u2479,m160,LITTERBUG,What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
83293,L443897,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!"
83294,L443896,u2479,m160,LITTERBUG,"Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself."
83295,L443895,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?"
83296,L443894,u2479,m160,LITTERBUG,"You better quit pushing me, pal."
83297,L443893,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?"
83298,L443892,u2479,m160,LITTERBUG,Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
83299,L443891,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
83300,L443890,u2479,m160,LITTERBUG,Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
83301,L443889,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime."
83302,L443888,u2479,m160,LITTERBUG,Yeah?  So what?
83303,L444396,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
83304,L444395,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
83305,L444394,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
83306,L444393,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him."
83307,L444388,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Who isn't?
83308,L444387,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You're afraid of him.
83309,L444386,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door."
83310,L444385,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Nigel, can't you see he's using you?"
83311,L444384,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"No!  Well, not those exact words."
83312,L444383,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Is that what Argon told you?
83313,L444382,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained."
83314,L444381,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?"
83315,L444380,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
83316,L444379,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?"
83317,L444378,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Opportunity?
83318,L444377,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here."
83319,L444376,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I don't believe this is happening...
83320,L444334,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown."
83321,L444333,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Of course, sir."
83322,L444323,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,You're looking for a urine sample.
83323,L444322,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You were never invited to my house.
83324,L443948,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested."
83325,L443947,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,What are you going to do?
83326,L443946,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
83327,L443945,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
83328,L443929,u2484,m160,SUSAN,This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
83329,L443928,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
83330,L443927,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The replicators?
83331,L443926,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Well, you got another problem."
83332,L443925,u2484,m160,SUSAN,They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
83333,L443924,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,What did security say?
83334,L443911,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,That's the guy?
83335,L443910,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
83336,L443909,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?"
83337,L443908,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
83338,L443907,u2484,m160,SUSAN,They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
83339,L443906,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?"
83340,L443905,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?"
83341,L443883,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
83342,L443882,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,What did he want?
83343,L443881,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
83344,L443880,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,A man?
83345,L443879,u2484,m160,SUSAN,This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
83346,L443878,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Aaabout...?
83347,L443877,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking..."
83348,L444551,u2483,m160,SIM,"Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time."
83349,L444550,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Susan!
83350,L444539,u2483,m160,SIM,"And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?"
83351,L444538,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight."
83352,L444516,u2483,m160,SIM,"So, I guess it worked."
83353,L444515,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Sir, please try to hold still."
83354,L444330,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!"
83355,L444329,u2483,m160,SIM,Like Crazy Glue?
83356,L444328,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate."
83357,L444327,u2483,m160,SIM,What's it smell like?
83358,L444321,u2483,m160,SIM,Okay.
83359,L444320,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research."
83360,L444319,u2483,m160,SIM,You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
83361,L444318,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,"Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!"
83362,L444317,u2483,m160,SIM,It's Sim.  We're almost there.
83363,L444316,u2480,m160,NEBBLEMAN,Yes?
83364,L444647,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I guess they do.
83365,L444646,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Things do change.
83366,L444637,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place."
83367,L444636,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,We were different people then.
83368,L444635,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"God, what a fight that was."
83369,L444634,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I remember I was trying to help...
83370,L444633,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?"
83371,L444593,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
83372,L444592,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I have to!
83373,L444591,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You're not going after Argon!
83374,L444589,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"We don't have time to argue, Susan."
83375,L444588,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste."
83376,L444581,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The same thing I suppose.
83377,L444580,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What would happen if I threw him into the core?
83378,L444579,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Yes.
83379,L444578,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,That means the nanobot is still inside him.
83380,L444577,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"You mean he's polymerized, like me?"
83381,L444576,u2484,m160,SUSAN,It's too late.  Argon injected it.
83382,L444575,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,We've got to get the nanobot.
83383,L444574,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower."
83384,L444573,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What in the...?
83385,L444571,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body..."
83386,L444570,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Susie... I...
83387,L444569,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Did you think I could just leave you...?
83388,L444568,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You saved my life.
83389,L444455,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"I'm not leaving without you, Susan!"
83390,L444454,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!"
83391,L444438,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Let's go.
83392,L444437,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Argon's private lab.
83393,L444436,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Where is it?
83394,L444435,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
83395,L444434,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?"
83396,L444433,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
83397,L444432,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You didn't think I could just leave you?
83398,L444431,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
83399,L444274,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --"
83400,L444273,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
83401,L444272,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
83402,L444267,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,The head shrinker at the prison.
83403,L444266,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Who is he?
83404,L444260,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,On the counter.
83405,L444259,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Did you go?
83406,L444254,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
83407,L444253,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You made this out of my hair?
83408,L444252,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Like a glove.
83409,L444251,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,That's going to fit me?
83410,L444250,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent."
83411,L444249,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What's that?
83412,L444244,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Getting used to it.
83413,L444243,u2484,m160,SUSAN,That's pretty good.
83414,L444226,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
83415,L444225,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,No cheese.
83416,L444224,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
83417,L444223,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I could go with you.
83418,L444222,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Something else I want to try.
83419,L444221,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What did you want my hair for?
83420,L444220,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
83421,L444213,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I don't know.
83422,L444212,u2484,m160,SUSAN,How far can you stretch?
83423,L444210,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,It's still inside me?
83424,L444209,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The nanobot... it's not here...
83425,L444208,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What's wrong?
83426,L444207,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Daniel, I didn't hear you come down..."
83427,L444206,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
83428,L444193,u2484,m160,SUSAN,No problem.
83429,L444192,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Do you have something to bring me down?
83430,L444191,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Probably the caffeine.
83431,L444190,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
83432,L444189,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I'm glad you came to me for help.
83433,L444188,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
83434,L444187,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Yeah.  Old times.
83435,L444186,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Just like old times.
83436,L444185,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
83437,L444184,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!"
83438,L444183,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
83439,L444182,u2484,m160,SUSAN,And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
83440,L444181,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
83441,L444180,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!"
83442,L444179,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
83443,L444178,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
83444,L444177,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Blame the victim.
83445,L444176,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You have no one to blame but yourself.
83446,L444175,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Just giving credit where credit is due.
83447,L444174,u2484,m160,SUSAN,What's that supposed to mean?
83448,L444173,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!"
83449,L444172,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something."
83450,L444171,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in."
83451,L444169,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
83452,L444168,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Just look at it!
83453,L444167,u2484,m160,SUSAN,What about it!
83454,L444166,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Look at this!
83455,L444165,u2484,m160,SUSAN,What?  What's wrong?
83456,L444164,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Susan!
83457,L444159,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"No, no, I just feel wired!"
83458,L444158,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Is something wrong?
83459,L444151,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"No, why?"
83460,L444150,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?"
83461,L444146,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You're the doctor.
83462,L444145,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you."
83463,L444141,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Isn't it already too late then?
83464,L444140,u2484,m160,SUSAN,That's right.
83465,L444139,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
83466,L444137,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else."
83467,L444136,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What do these replicators do to people?
83468,L444135,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Three days ago it was.
83469,L444134,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,That was an egg?
83470,L444133,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What happens?
83471,L444132,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize."
83472,L444126,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,The waste.
83473,L444125,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The problem is the by-product created by the process.
83474,L444124,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Got it.
83475,L444123,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being."
83476,L444122,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,That was 'simple'?
83477,L444121,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level."
83478,L444118,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What waste?
83479,L444117,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
83480,L444116,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Why do we need it?
83481,L444115,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically."
83482,L444114,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
83483,L444113,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those."
83484,L444112,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Why?
83485,L444111,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
83486,L444110,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What are these?
83487,L444109,u2484,m160,SUSAN,What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
83488,L444108,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,We don't?
83489,L444107,u2484,m160,SUSAN,We don't have time for hysterics.
83490,L444106,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
83491,L444105,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Daniel!
83492,L444104,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!"
83493,L444103,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
83494,L444102,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!"
83495,L444101,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
83496,L444100,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Yes.
83497,L444099,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have."
83498,L444098,u2484,m160,SUSAN,It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
83499,L444097,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You don't know?
83500,L444096,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I don't know.
83501,L444095,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What happened to it?
83502,L444094,u2484,m160,SUSAN,My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
83503,L444093,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Mouse?  What mouse?
83504,L444092,u2484,m160,SUSAN,... just like the mouse.
83505,L444090,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The nanobot.
83506,L444089,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,They did it to me!
83507,L444087,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"No, something is really wrong... look!"
83508,L444086,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist."
83509,L444085,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!"
83510,L444084,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Daniel, what are you doing here?"
83511,L444083,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Susie!  You gotta help me!
83512,L443988,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Susan, this is the future of America here."
83513,L443987,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Daniel, give him the Trix."
83514,L443978,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
83515,L443977,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You're insane.
83516,L443976,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes."
83517,L443974,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what."
83518,L443973,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
83519,L443972,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!"
83520,L443971,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"We've had this conversation already, Daniel."
83521,L443970,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?"
83522,L443969,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange."
83523,L443968,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
83524,L443967,u2484,m160,SUSAN,We'll see?  What does that mean?
83525,L443966,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Yeah, we'll see."
83526,L443965,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful."
83527,L443847,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,That's what I thought.
83528,L443846,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Nothing really worthwhile.
83529,L443845,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
83530,L443844,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going."
83531,L443843,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Yeah.
83532,L443842,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all."
83533,L443841,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?"
83534,L443840,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Right.  You predicted it.
83535,L443839,u2484,m160,SUSAN,And for cleaning up oil spills.
83536,L443838,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
83537,L443837,u2484,m160,SUSAN,It already is.
83538,L443836,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world."
83539,L443835,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I guess I should be flattered.
83540,L443834,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going."
83541,L443832,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
83542,L443831,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals."
83543,L443830,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,The big house.
83544,L443829,u2484,m160,SUSAN,The big house?
83545,L443828,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man."
83546,L443827,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Is that so?
83547,L443826,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same."
83548,L443825,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Same old Daniel.
83549,L443824,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Somebody has to.
83550,L443822,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"You know, this and that."
83551,L443821,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Really?  What have you been doing?
83552,L443820,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,Been out for six months now.
83553,L443819,u2484,m160,SUSAN,When did you...?
83554,L443818,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
83555,L443817,u2484,m160,SUSAN,Daniel...
83556,L444559,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"The question is, are you?"
83557,L444558,u2483,m160,SIM,Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
83558,L444557,u2483,m160,SIM,Oh yeah?
83559,L444556,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,All the different ways that I could kill you.
83560,L444449,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?"
83561,L444448,u2483,m160,SIM,"Yeah, and what might that be?"
83562,L444447,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you."
83563,L444446,u2483,m160,SIM,You were looking for us?
83564,L444445,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
83565,L444048,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,"Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer."
83566,L444047,u2483,m160,SIM,Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
83567,L444046,u2483,m160,SIM,That's right.
83568,L444045,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
83569,L444044,u2483,m160,SIM,Oh yes you are!
83570,L444043,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,What?  I'm not going anywhere!
83571,L444042,u2483,m160,SIM,I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
83572,L444041,u2481,m160,O'BRIEN,You!  I remember you!
83573,L444071,u2483,m160,SIM,We lost him.
83574,L444070,u2482,m160,POPPY,And you have him?
83575,L444069,u2483,m160,SIM,"Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically."
83576,L444068,u2482,m160,POPPY,Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
83577,L444067,u2483,m160,SIM,Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
83578,L444000,u2482,m160,POPPY,It's a miracle.
83579,L443999,u2483,m160,SIM,That's impossible.
83580,L444606,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Don't worry, four eyes."
83581,L444605,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with."
83582,L444602,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!"
83583,L444601,u2482,m160,POPPY,Icky!
83584,L443943,u2484,m160,SUSAN,You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
83585,L443942,u2482,m160,POPPY,I could have you fired right now.
83586,L443941,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?"
83587,L443940,u2482,m160,POPPY,"If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job."
83588,L443939,u2482,m160,POPPY,"While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out."
83589,L443938,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --"
83590,L443937,u2482,m160,POPPY,"Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?"
83591,L443936,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --"
83592,L443934,u2482,m160,POPPY,He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
83593,L443933,u2484,m160,SUSAN,I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
83594,L443932,u2482,m160,POPPY,I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
83595,L443931,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?"
83596,L443930,u2482,m160,POPPY,Vermin...
83597,L444276,u2483,m160,SIM,"Pipe down, brain lady!  And you..."
83598,L444275,u2484,m160,SUSAN,What in the hell?
83599,L443922,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Yes, he might be."
83600,L443921,u2483,m160,SIM,"In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?"
83601,L443920,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"Yes, that is what I was thinking."
83602,L443919,u2483,m160,SIM,"If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it."
83603,L443916,u2483,m160,SIM,'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
83604,L443915,u2484,m160,SUSAN,"It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before."
83605,L445316,u2485,m161,ANNE,Dexter.
83606,L445315,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"Well, what else do you expect them to call you?"
83607,L444925,u2485,m161,ANNE,You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
83608,L444924,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?"
83609,L444923,u2485,m161,ANNE,Exactly.
83610,L444922,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
83611,L444921,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment."
83612,L444916,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Yes - Sing Sing.
83613,L444915,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?"
83614,L445503,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I think you should, Miss Gallagher."
83615,L445502,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"I think I better go, Stew."
83616,L445240,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Goodbye, Stew"
83617,L445239,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Goodbye, Miss Gallagher."
83618,L445238,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith."
83619,L445237,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher."
83620,L445236,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Yes - isn't it.
83621,L445235,u2485,m161,ANNE,Indeed? How interesting.
83622,L445528,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say ""Mr. Stew Smith"" and you'll have to be ""Mrs. Stew Smith"" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husbandHe has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher."
83623,L445527,u2485,m161,ANNE,You're acting like a child.
83624,L445526,u2495,m161,STEW,Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
83625,L445525,u2485,m161,ANNE,That's ridiculous.
83626,L445524,u2495,m161,STEW,"You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware."
83627,L445517,u2485,m161,ANNE,You can't walk out of here like this.
83628,L445516,u2495,m161,STEW,"This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that."
83629,L445515,u2485,m161,ANNE,Stewart!
83630,L445514,u2495,m161,STEW,"and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out."
83631,L445511,u2495,m161,STEW,"O-o-oh, I get you  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?"
83632,L445510,u2485,m161,ANNE,Your house?
83633,L445509,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?"
83634,L445508,u2485,m161,ANNE,Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
83635,L445507,u2495,m161,STEW,Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
83636,L445506,u2485,m161,ANNE,The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
83637,L445505,u2495,m161,STEW,"What's the idea, Anne?"
83638,L445500,u2495,m161,STEW,"Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time."
83639,L445499,u2485,m161,ANNE,I see.
83640,L445498,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them."
83641,L445496,u2485,m161,ANNE,Good morning. What does this mean?
83642,L445495,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh hello, Anne He types furiously."
83643,L445357,u2485,m161,ANNE,"That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do."
83644,L445356,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I"
83645,L445355,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?"
83646,L445354,u2495,m161,STEW,I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
83647,L445353,u2485,m161,ANNE,But I don't want to meet your gang.
83648,L445352,u2495,m161,STEW,I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
83649,L445351,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Will you stop being silly, Stewart?"
83650,L445350,u2495,m161,STEW,Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
83651,L445349,u2485,m161,ANNE,Are you crazy?
83652,L445348,u2495,m161,STEW,I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
83653,L445347,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Look out for my lipstick, Stewart."
83654,L445346,u2495,m161,STEW,"Anne, come here. Listen"
83655,L445342,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters."
83656,L445341,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?"
83657,L445340,u2495,m161,STEW,"Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home."
83658,L445339,u2485,m161,ANNE,What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
83659,L445338,u2495,m161,STEW,I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
83660,L445337,u2485,m161,ANNE,What are you talking about?
83661,L445336,u2495,m161,STEW,I'm not going!
83662,L445335,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?"
83663,L445334,u2495,m161,STEW,I poisoned him.
83664,L445333,u2485,m161,ANNE,Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
83665,L445312,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however."
83666,L445311,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?"
83667,L445243,u2495,m161,STEW,You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
83668,L445242,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I thought I was very charming, Stewart."
83669,L445241,u2495,m161,STEW,"That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her."
83670,L445232,u2495,m161,STEW,"Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all."
83671,L445231,u2485,m161,ANNE,No? What do you look upon her as?
83672,L445229,u2485,m161,ANNE,Yes - isn't it?
83673,L445228,u2495,m161,STEW,Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
83674,L445227,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl."
83675,L445226,u2495,m161,STEW,Gallagher?
83676,L445225,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl."
83677,L445223,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith."
83678,L445222,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?"
83679,L445221,u2495,m161,STEW,Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
83680,L445220,u2485,m161,ANNE,Gallagher!
83681,L445219,u2495,m161,STEW,"Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher."
83682,L445151,u2485,m161,ANNE,Oh yes you will wear garters
83683,L445150,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters"
83684,L445149,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!"
83685,L445148,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!"
83686,L445147,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!"
83687,L445146,u2495,m161,STEW,"Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!"
83688,L445145,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters."
83689,L445144,u2495,m161,STEW,Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
83690,L445143,u2485,m161,ANNE,I know that.
83691,L445142,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years."
83692,L445141,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You wear them of course, silly."
83693,L445140,u2495,m161,STEW,Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
83694,L445139,u2485,m161,ANNE,Do you like them?
83695,L445138,u2495,m161,STEW,"Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!"
83696,L445137,u2485,m161,ANNE,I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
83697,L445087,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose."
83698,L445086,u2495,m161,STEW,"Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live"
83699,L445085,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now"
83700,L445084,u2495,m161,STEW,It isn't cheap. It's nice.
83701,L445083,u2485,m161,ANNE,What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
83702,L445082,u2495,m161,STEW,"Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!"
83703,L445081,u2485,m161,ANNE,You have the cutest nose I've
83704,L445080,u2495,m161,STEW,Now let's get this settled
83705,L445079,u2485,m161,ANNE,Of course I am Stewart.
83706,L445078,u2495,m161,STEW,"Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?"
83707,L445077,u2495,m161,STEW,"I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room."
83708,L445076,u2485,m161,ANNE,"But we don't need it, I'm sure."
83709,L445075,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?"
83710,L445074,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think."
83711,L445073,u2495,m161,STEW,We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
83712,L445071,u2495,m161,STEW,"When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?"
83713,L445070,u2485,m161,ANNE,Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
83714,L445069,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids."
83715,L445068,u2485,m161,ANNE,Your place?
83716,L445067,u2495,m161,STEW,"I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you."
83717,L445066,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You ought to get some new ties, Stewart."
83718,L445065,u2495,m161,STEW,"What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot"
83719,L445061,u2485,m161,ANNE,I'm glad.
83720,L445060,u2495,m161,STEW,"A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him."
83721,L445050,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother."
83722,L445049,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married."
83723,L444940,u2485,m161,ANNE,"That's because you're too far away, Stew."
83724,L444939,u2495,m161,STEW,"My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet."
83725,L444938,u2485,m161,ANNE,"None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me."
83726,L444937,u2495,m161,STEW,"Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne."
83727,L444936,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?"
83728,L444929,u2495,m161,STEW,How-di-do.
83729,L444928,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff"
83730,L444911,u2485,m161,ANNE,Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
83731,L444910,u2495,m161,STEW,"It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right."
83732,L444909,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, Mother!"
83733,L444895,u2485,m161,ANNE,Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
83734,L444894,u2495,m161,STEW,"Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?"
83735,L444893,u2485,m161,ANNE,I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
83736,L444890,u2485,m161,ANNE,You don't wear garters!
83737,L444889,u2495,m161,STEW,"Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me"
83738,L444888,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?"
83739,L444887,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village."
83740,L444886,u2485,m161,ANNE,Really?
83741,L444882,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler."
83742,L444881,u2485,m161,ANNE,won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
83743,L444880,u2495,m161,STEW,I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
83744,L444879,u2485,m161,ANNE,You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and
83745,L444878,u2495,m161,STEW,Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
83746,L444877,u2485,m161,ANNE,I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
83747,L444875,u2485,m161,ANNE,"For the letters, of course."
83748,L444874,u2495,m161,STEW,For what?
83749,L444873,u2485,m161,ANNE,Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
83750,L444869,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, I'll take a chance."
83751,L444868,u2485,m161,ANNE,Will you step into the library?
83752,L444867,u2495,m161,STEW,"So, it's obvious, huh?"
83753,L444866,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious."
83754,L444865,u2495,m161,STEW,No - give you another guess.
83755,L444864,u2485,m161,ANNE,I suppose you're going to print them?
83756,L444863,u2495,m161,STEW,I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
83757,L444862,u2485,m161,ANNE,Where did you get those letters?
83758,L444860,u2485,m161,ANNE,I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
83759,L444859,u2495,m161,STEW,Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
83760,L444858,u2485,m161,ANNE,Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
83761,L444857,u2495,m161,STEW,Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
83762,L444856,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance"
83763,L444855,u2485,m161,ANNE,I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
83764,L444854,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it."
83765,L444853,u2485,m161,ANNE,That's considerate of you.
83766,L444852,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand."
83767,L444851,u2485,m161,ANNE,What do you want?
83768,L444848,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You may go, Smythe."
83769,L444847,u2495,m161,STEW,That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
83770,L444804,u2495,m161,STEW,You're all right.
83771,L444803,u2485,m161,ANNE,Certainly. Right over there.
83772,L444802,u2495,m161,STEW,May I use your telephone?
83773,L444800,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand."
83774,L444799,u2495,m161,STEW,"You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds."
83775,L444793,u2495,m161,STEW,No? Why not?
83776,L444792,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?"
83777,L444791,u2495,m161,STEW,"Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble."
83778,L444790,u2485,m161,ANNE,I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
83779,L444788,u2495,m161,STEW,I don't mind her if you don't.
83780,L444787,u2485,m161,ANNE,Don't mind Mother.
83781,L445320,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!"
83782,L445319,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it."
83783,L445291,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Look! Look! The front page!
83784,L445290,u2485,m161,ANNE,Mother!
83785,L445289,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Ah-ah-ah!
83786,L445288,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
83787,L445287,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him."
83788,L445286,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
83789,L445285,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things."
83790,L445284,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
83791,L445283,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night."
83792,L445040,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Sit down!
83793,L445039,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher"
83794,L445038,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!"
83795,L444902,u2485,m161,ANNE,Why
83796,L444901,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,What is this person doing here?
83797,L444899,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, hello Mother!"
83798,L444898,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,That's an excellent idea.
83799,L444698,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"Oh, shut up!"
83800,L444697,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face."
83801,L444696,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces."
83802,L444695,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago."
83803,L445256,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it."
83804,L445255,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat."
83805,L445254,u2486,m161,BINGY,"a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die."
83806,L445253,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know"
83807,L445252,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening"
83808,L445251,u2486,m161,BINGY,I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
83809,L445250,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Who is it you wish to see, sir?"
83810,L445249,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Hello, there, Meadows![13]"
83811,L444754,u2486,m161,BINGY,I certainly will.
83812,L444753,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Give my regards to your managing editor.
83813,L444752,u2486,m161,BINGY,"All right, all right, don't mention it."
83814,L444751,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Thank you very much.
83815,L444750,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it."
83816,L444749,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey."
83817,L444748,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"So, you see how silly that rumor is?"
83818,L444746,u2486,m161,BINGY,Oh yeah?
83819,L444745,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever."
83820,L444744,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about"
83821,L444743,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
83822,L444742,u2486,m161,BINGY,Yeah!
83823,L444741,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,As one Tribune man to another
83824,L444740,u2486,m161,BINGY,Is that so?
83825,L444739,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know."
83826,L444736,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,We were classmates.
83827,L444735,u2486,m161,BINGY,Huh?
83828,L444734,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"Yale '21, I believe."
83829,L444733,u2486,m161,BINGY,Is that so?
83830,L444732,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,I knew your managing editor very well.
83831,L444731,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Well, I should say!"
83832,L444730,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Fine newspaper the Tribune.
83833,L444728,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Oh, man!"
83834,L444727,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,This way.
83835,L444726,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Thanks, I will."
83836,L444725,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Fine. Have a seat.
83837,L444724,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Yeah, hello. How are you?"
83838,L444723,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,You're the Tribune man?
83839,L444722,u2486,m161,BINGY,What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
83840,L445445,u2495,m161,STEW,"You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink."
83841,L445444,u2486,m161,BINGY,"I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!"
83842,L445443,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it."
83843,L445442,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news."
83844,L445440,u2495,m161,STEW,"Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world."
83845,L445439,u2486,m161,BINGY,Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
83846,L445437,u2486,m161,BINGY,"No, it's just little Bingy Baker."
83847,L445436,u2495,m161,STEW,Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
83848,L445277,u2486,m161,BINGY,There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
83849,L445276,u2495,m161,STEW,I'll bite. What's the catch?
83850,L445275,u2486,m161,BINGY,It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
83851,L445274,u2495,m161,STEW,Yeah - go on.
83852,L445273,u2486,m161,BINGY,Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
83853,L445272,u2495,m161,STEW,Yeah?
83854,L445271,u2486,m161,BINGY,I bring a message from Garcia.
83855,L445269,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it."
83856,L445268,u2486,m161,BINGY,"A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  ""Just A Gigolo . . . """
83857,L445267,u2495,m161,STEW,"Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?"
83858,L445266,u2486,m161,BINGY,Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
83859,L445265,u2495,m161,STEW,How's that?
83860,L445264,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Oh boy, I'd love it."
83861,L445263,u2495,m161,STEW,"Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?"
83862,L445262,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman."
83863,L445261,u2495,m161,STEW,What do you want?
83864,L444720,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Hey, make up your mind, will you?"
83865,L444719,u2495,m161,STEW,Impossible. Put it on again.
83866,L444717,u2495,m161,STEW,I'm afraid.
83867,L444716,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Oh, is that so?"
83868,L444715,u2495,m161,STEW,Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
83869,L444714,u2486,m161,BINGY,"Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition."
83870,L445023,u2487,m161,CONROY,"'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha"
83871,L445022,u2495,m161,STEW,No!
83872,L445021,u2487,m161,CONROY,No?
83873,L445020,u2495,m161,STEW,I'm not quitting!
83874,L445019,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting."
83875,L445018,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Araby, my eye!"
83876,L445017,u2495,m161,STEW,Sure.
83877,L445016,u2487,m161,CONROY,Araby?
83878,L445015,u2495,m161,STEW,Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
83879,L445014,u2487,m161,CONROY,The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
83880,L445013,u2495,m161,STEW,My play.
83881,L445012,u2487,m161,CONROY,What play?
83882,L445011,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play."
83883,L445010,u2487,m161,CONROY,"And live on your salary, I suppose?"
83884,L445009,u2495,m161,STEW,"Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?"
83885,L445008,u2487,m161,CONROY,You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
83886,L445007,u2495,m161,STEW,A what?
83887,L445006,u2487,m161,CONROY,Just a boid in a gilded cage -
83888,L444999,u2495,m161,STEW,That's so.
83889,L444998,u2487,m161,CONROY,Is that so?
83890,L444997,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith."
83891,L444996,u2487,m161,CONROY,Mr. Schuyler .
83892,L444994,u2495,m161,STEW,Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
83893,L444993,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Well, when are you quitting?"
83894,L444990,u2487,m161,CONROY,Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
83895,L444989,u2495,m161,STEW,Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
83896,L444959,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all."
83897,L444958,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, sir."
83898,L444957,u2487,m161,CONROY,"What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?"
83899,L444956,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe."
83900,L444955,u2487,m161,CONROY,Why not?
83901,L444954,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all."
83902,L444953,u2487,m161,CONROY,"I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?"
83903,L444952,u2487,m161,CONROY,"No? Well, where were you when that happened?"
83904,L444951,u2495,m161,STEW,"Not on my own beat, no."
83905,L444950,u2487,m161,CONROY,"You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!"
83906,L444949,u2495,m161,STEW,It has been alleged - yes
83907,L444948,u2487,m161,CONROY,Do you call yourself a reporter?
83908,L444947,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account"
83909,L444688,u2495,m161,STEW,I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
83910,L444687,u2487,m161,CONROY,"What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is."
83911,L444686,u2495,m161,STEW,All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
83912,L444685,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it."
83913,L444684,u2495,m161,STEW,Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
83914,L444683,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Come on, get going, get going!"
83915,L444682,u2495,m161,STEW,Well - it's only April.
83916,L444681,u2487,m161,CONROY,Right - for the first time this year.
83917,L444680,u2495,m161,STEW,"The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?"
83918,L444679,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Yeah, little Gloria."
83919,L444678,u2495,m161,STEW,Gloria Golden?
83920,L444677,u2487,m161,CONROY,"Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame."
83921,L444675,u2495,m161,STEW,"It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts."
83922,L444674,u2487,m161,CONROY,Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
83923,L444673,u2495,m161,STEW,With me you can always do business.
83924,L444672,u2487,m161,CONROY,Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
83925,L444670,u2495,m161,STEW,"You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!"
83926,L444669,u2487,m161,CONROY,Yeah?
83927,L444668,u2495,m161,STEW,Yeah.
83928,L444667,u2487,m161,CONROY,Yeah?
83929,L444666,u2495,m161,STEW,"Look, I quit!"
83930,L445132,u2488,m161,DAWSON,Yes sir!
83931,L445131,u2495,m161,STEW,A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
83932,L445130,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Yes, sir. Very good, sir."
83933,L445129,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!"
83934,L445128,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"That's a canary, sir."
83935,L445125,u2495,m161,STEW,"There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!"
83936,L445124,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?"
83937,L445123,u2495,m161,STEW,Outside!
83938,L445122,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
83939,L445121,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, outside!"
83940,L445118,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Now Mr. Smith, now please"
83941,L445117,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact."
83942,L445116,u2488,m161,DAWSON,Quite so. Quite.
83943,L445115,u2495,m161,STEW,Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
83944,L445113,u2495,m161,STEW,But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
83945,L445112,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Thank you, sir."
83946,L445111,u2495,m161,STEW,"Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife."
83947,L445109,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir."
83948,L445108,u2495,m161,STEW,What are you doing fooling around in here?
83949,L445107,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Oh no, sir!"
83950,L445106,u2495,m161,STEW,Did you take anything out of those pants?
83951,L445104,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir."
83952,L445103,u2495,m161,STEW,Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
83953,L445102,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Drunk, sir?"
83954,L445101,u2495,m161,STEW,"Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?"
83955,L445100,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Dawson, sir."
83956,L445099,u2495,m161,STEW,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?"
83957,L445098,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"Your valet, sir."
83958,L445097,u2495,m161,STEW,You're my what?
83959,L445096,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir."
83960,L445095,u2495,m161,STEW,Who are you?
83961,L445094,u2495,m161,STEW,I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
83962,L445093,u2488,m161,DAWSON,"How do you like your bath, sir?"
83963,L445192,u2492,m161,MISS WILSON,"You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?"
83964,L445191,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,I bet.
83965,L445190,u2492,m161,MISS WILSON,"He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight."
83966,L445189,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Yes.
83967,L445188,u2492,m161,MISS WILSON,"Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?"
83968,L445187,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
83969,L445186,u2492,m161,MISS WILSON,That's a lovely dress.
83970,L445183,u2492,m161,MISS WILSON,"Yes, of course. I'll get it for you"
83971,L445182,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?"
83972,L445181,u2492,m161,MISS WILSON,"Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?"
83973,L445180,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
83974,L445179,u2492,m161,MISS WILSON,I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
83975,L445178,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Yes.
83976,L445585,u2495,m161,STEW,"There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you."
83977,L445584,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,No.
83978,L445583,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?"
83979,L445582,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
83980,L445581,u2495,m161,STEW,"The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story."
83981,L445580,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,What other girl?
83982,L445578,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over."
83983,L445577,u2495,m161,STEW,"It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?"
83984,L445575,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act."
83985,L445574,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,What did he want?
83986,L445573,u2495,m161,STEW,Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
83987,L445572,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Who was that?
83988,L445546,u2495,m161,STEW,"Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all."
83989,L445545,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Sorry, boss"
83990,L445544,u2495,m161,STEW,Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
83991,L445543,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,It'll be ready in a minute.
83992,L445542,u2495,m161,STEW,How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
83993,L445541,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Yeah?
83994,L445540,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hey, Gallagher!"
83995,L445536,u2495,m161,STEW,"Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all."
83996,L445535,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way."
83997,L445494,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Very good.
83998,L445493,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?"
83999,L445492,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
84000,L445491,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?"
84001,L445477,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?"
84002,L445476,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Here you are.
84003,L445475,u2495,m161,STEW,"You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?"
84004,L445474,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,What could I be?
84005,L445473,u2495,m161,STEW,And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
84006,L445472,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine..."
84007,L445471,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now..."
84008,L445470,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
84009,L445469,u2495,m161,STEW,Right.
84010,L445468,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
84011,L445467,u2495,m161,STEW,Right.
84012,L445466,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
84013,L445464,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?"
84014,L445463,u2495,m161,STEW,What do you know about Conrad?
84015,L445462,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Conrad.
84016,L445461,u2495,m161,STEW,Did who?
84017,L445460,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
84018,L445459,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose."
84019,L445458,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Then how do you expect to write about it?
84020,L445457,u2495,m161,STEW,Never even been to New Madrid.
84021,L445456,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,To Old Madrid.
84022,L445455,u2495,m161,STEW,Been where?
84023,L445454,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?"
84024,L445453,u2495,m161,STEW,Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
84025,L445452,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory."
84026,L445450,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far."
84027,L445449,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,How far have you gotten?
84028,L445447,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Yes - and I'd love it.
84029,L445446,u2495,m161,STEW,You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
84030,L445434,u2495,m161,STEW,Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
84031,L445433,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Okay.
84032,L445432,u2495,m161,STEW,I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
84033,L445431,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest."
84034,L445408,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hello, Hank. How are you?"
84035,L445407,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Hello, Stew."
84036,L445406,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you."
84037,L445248,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Yes.
84038,L445247,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?"
84039,L445246,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help."
84040,L445245,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry."
84041,L445234,u2495,m161,STEW,Right!
84042,L445233,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,They all consider me just as one of the boys.
84043,L445217,u2495,m161,STEW,Must be my wife.
84044,L445216,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,My mistake - she's glaring.
84045,L445215,u2495,m161,STEW,Staring at us?
84046,L445214,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
84047,L445213,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good."
84048,L445212,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,I dyed one and washed the other.
84049,L445211,u2495,m161,STEW,What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
84050,L445210,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Nothing.
84051,L445209,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?"
84052,L445208,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten."
84053,L445207,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck."
84054,L445206,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Well, I'll have to look someplace else."
84055,L445205,u2495,m161,STEW,"Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here."
84056,L445204,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
84057,L445203,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?"
84058,L445202,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,There you are!
84059,L445201,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you."
84060,L445200,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph."
84061,L445030,u2495,m161,STEW,"Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?"
84062,L445029,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,How is her family going to feel about it?
84063,L445028,u2495,m161,STEW,"I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?"
84064,L445027,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Sure - I think so, Stew."
84065,L445026,u2495,m161,STEW,"Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?"
84066,L445025,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about."
84067,L444985,u2495,m161,STEW,Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
84068,L444984,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -"
84069,L444983,u2495,m161,STEW,"Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?"
84070,L444982,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men."
84071,L444981,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone."
84072,L444980,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,My error.
84073,L444979,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name."
84074,L444978,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Remember, she's a Schuyler."
84075,L444977,u2495,m161,STEW,"Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that."
84076,L444976,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
84077,L444975,u2495,m161,STEW,"Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that."
84078,L444974,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Not since you broke into society.
84079,L444973,u2495,m161,STEW,"Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?"
84080,L444972,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
84081,L444971,u2495,m161,STEW,"Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her."
84082,L444970,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,It's the smoke.
84083,L444969,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?"
84084,L444968,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,I hope you'll be very happy.
84085,L444967,u2495,m161,STEW,"Thanks, thanks."
84086,L444966,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal."
84087,L444965,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?"
84088,L444964,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,I didn't run away.
84089,L444963,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?"
84090,L444834,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me."
84091,L444833,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Well!
84092,L444832,u2495,m161,STEW,"There you go, talking like a woman!"
84093,L444831,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,And the rest of us are truck horses?
84094,L444830,u2495,m161,STEW,Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
84095,L444829,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse."
84096,L444828,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds."
84097,L444827,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,Of course I haven't got a nose.
84098,L444826,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!"
84099,L444825,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot."
84100,L444824,u2495,m161,STEW,and those and them.
84101,L444823,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,and that
84102,L444822,u2495,m161,STEW,"And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it"
84103,L444820,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!"
84104,L444819,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there."
84105,L444818,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing."
84106,L444817,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,You what?
84107,L444816,u2495,m161,STEW,I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
84108,L444815,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
84109,L444660,u2495,m161,STEW,"There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that."
84110,L444659,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,The boss is getting hoarse.
84111,L444658,u2495,m161,STEW,"Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!"
84112,L444657,u2489,m161,GALLAGHER,"Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again."
84113,L445571,u2495,m161,STEW,And now for that twentieth crack
84114,L445570,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Yes.
84115,L445569,u2495,m161,STEW,"Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!"
84116,L445568,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,We just thought that
84117,L445567,u2495,m161,STEW,"Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys."
84118,L445566,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,I beg your pardon.
84119,L445565,u2495,m161,STEW,"Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut."
84120,L445564,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"That's putting it crudely, but"
84121,L445563,u2495,m161,STEW,Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
84122,L445561,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
84123,L445560,u2495,m161,STEW,"Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast."
84124,L445559,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
84125,L445558,u2495,m161,STEW,She did?
84126,L445557,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
84127,L445556,u2495,m161,STEW,You don't.
84128,L445555,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,I don't eat waffles.
84129,L445554,u2495,m161,STEW,"Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle."
84130,L445553,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Thanks. May I sit down?
84131,L445552,u2495,m161,STEW,"Surely, come right in."
84132,L445551,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?"
84133,L445550,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing."
84134,L445549,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,I suppose you know why I came?
84135,L445548,u2495,m161,STEW,Holy jumping swordfish!
84136,L445547,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"Hello, Smith."
84137,L445310,u2495,m161,STEW,"Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?"
84138,L445309,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Traps shut!
84139,L445308,u2495,m161,STEW,"Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut."
84140,L445307,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"Well, at best you might deny it."
84141,L445306,u2495,m161,STEW,You quit trying to stop anybody
84142,L445305,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless."
84143,L444785,u2495,m161,STEW,"Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and"
84144,L444784,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,I think you'd better go.
84145,L444779,u2495,m161,STEW,"Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter."
84146,L444778,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
84147,L444775,u2495,m161,STEW,Good.
84148,L444774,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,I have it here.
84149,L444773,u2495,m161,STEW,A statement? Good.
84150,L444772,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,"We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared."
84151,L444771,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?"
84152,L444768,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars."
84153,L444767,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
84154,L444766,u2495,m161,STEW,Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
84155,L444765,u2490,m161,GRAYSON,Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
84156,L444764,u2495,m161,STEW,"Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?"
84157,L445428,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!"
84158,L445427,u2491,m161,HANK,The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
84159,L445426,u2495,m161,STEW,I'm sorry nobody could come.
84160,L445416,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hello, Joe."
84161,L445415,u2491,m161,HANK,"Come in, Joe. It's all right."
84162,L445414,u2495,m161,STEW,It's all right. Bring him in.
84163,L445413,u2491,m161,HANK,"I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?"
84164,L445412,u2495,m161,STEW,Sure.
84165,L445411,u2491,m161,HANK,Okay - you remember Joe
84166,L445410,u2495,m161,STEW,Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
84167,L445409,u2491,m161,HANK,"Fine, but kinda thirsty."
84168,L445486,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,I have. Double-strength!
84169,L445485,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"Smythe, you've been drinking."
84170,L445325,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,They've been ready for the last half hour.
84171,L445324,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Are the cars ready?
84172,L445323,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception."
84173,L445297,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"""Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"""
84174,L445296,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,Double-strength!
84175,L445036,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,Double strength!
84176,L445035,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Some bicarbonate - quick!
84177,L444707,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready."
84178,L444706,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me."
84179,L444700,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?"
84180,L444699,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"What is it, Smythe?"
84181,L445522,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law."
84182,L445521,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Heavens! The man's insane!
84183,L445520,u2495,m161,STEW,Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
84184,L445519,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,What's going on here? Who is this woman?
84185,L445318,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?"
84186,L445317,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now."
84187,L445314,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man."
84188,L445313,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,And you struck him right here in our house?
84189,L445304,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! ""I wear the pants!"" The pants ! Not even the trousers!"
84190,L445303,u2495,m161,STEW,He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
84191,L445302,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,I beg your pardon?
84192,L445301,u2495,m161,STEW,Yes - the worm!
84193,L445300,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Have you seen this?
84194,L445299,u2495,m161,STEW,"Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?"
84195,L445053,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?"
84196,L445052,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, Grandma"
84197,L445051,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Stop calling me Mother!
84198,L445047,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all."
84199,L445046,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,About what? Your marriage to Anne!
84200,L445045,u2495,m161,STEW,Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
84201,L444908,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Get out of here.
84202,L444907,u2495,m161,STEW,"With pleasure, Madame!"
84203,L444906,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
84204,L444904,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,Why
84205,L444903,u2495,m161,STEW,"As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?"
84206,L444770,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters..."
84207,L444769,u2493,m161,MRS. SCHUYLER,"Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!"
84208,L445430,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?"
84209,L445429,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!"
84210,L445405,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Very good, sir."
84211,L445404,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends."
84212,L445397,u2495,m161,STEW,That's all I wanted to know!
84213,L445396,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,Yes.
84214,L445395,u2495,m161,STEW,A bird in a gilded cage?
84215,L445394,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage."
84216,L445393,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?"
84217,L445392,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir."
84218,L445391,u2495,m161,STEW,"How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?"
84219,L445390,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,Yes sir.
84220,L445389,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer."
84221,L445388,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,Yes sir.
84222,L445387,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?"
84223,L445386,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it."
84224,L445385,u2495,m161,STEW,"No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?"
84225,L445384,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"That's puttering, sir."
84226,L445383,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Well sir, I'll show you."
84227,L445382,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?"
84228,L445381,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands."
84229,L445380,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?"
84230,L445379,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,I just putter.
84231,L445378,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?"
84232,L445377,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Well, sir, I putter."
84233,L445376,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?"
84234,L445375,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Yes, sir."
84235,L445374,u2495,m161,STEW,It's haunted just the same.
84236,L445373,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"No, sir."
84237,L445372,u2495,m161,STEW,Found no skeletons?
84238,L445371,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Yes, sir."
84239,L445370,u2495,m161,STEW,Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
84240,L445369,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"No, sir!"
84241,L445368,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted."
84242,L445366,u2495,m161,STEW,Yeah.
84243,L445365,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Me, sir?"
84244,L445364,u2495,m161,STEW,You try it.
84245,L445363,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Yes, sir."
84246,L445362,u2495,m161,STEW,Shhh! Do you hear something?
84247,L445361,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?"
84248,L445360,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Did you call, sir?"
84249,L445282,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Yes, sir."
84250,L445281,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving."
84251,L445280,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's what I think of it, Bingy!"
84252,L445279,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"Well done, sir. Very neat."
84253,L444850,u2495,m161,STEW,Now the lady said you may go
84254,L444849,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,But I
84255,L444841,u2495,m161,STEW,"I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together."
84256,L444840,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
84257,L444839,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe"
84258,L444838,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,The name is Smythe.
84259,L444837,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?"
84260,L444713,u2494,m161,SMYTHE,"I understand, sir."
84261,L444712,u2495,m161,STEW,There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
84262,L447968,u2496,m162,BETTY,Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
84263,L447967,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What?
84264,L447966,u2496,m162,BETTY,Yes ...  It's just that ...
84265,L447963,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Okay.
84266,L447962,u2496,m162,BETTY,Yes.
84267,L447961,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,You sure you want to know this?
84268,L447959,u2496,m162,BETTY,Ah.
84269,L447958,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,... Sex.
84270,L447957,u2496,m162,BETTY,No. I want to know.
84271,L447956,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,It doesn't matter.
84272,L447955,u2496,m162,BETTY,What?
84273,L447954,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Yeah ...  That--and ...
84274,L447953,u2496,m162,BETTY,"Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?"
84275,L447952,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What do you mean?
84276,L447951,u2496,m162,BETTY,What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
84277,L447950,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Sure.
84278,L447949,u2496,m162,BETTY,Can I ask you a question?
84279,L447948,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Yeah?
84280,L447947,u2496,m162,BETTY,Mary Sue?
84281,L447659,u2496,m162,BETTY,Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
84282,L447658,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
84283,L447657,u2496,m162,BETTY,I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
84284,L447652,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Thanks.
84285,L447651,u2496,m162,BETTY,I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
84286,L448542,u2496,m162,BETTY,I love you too.
84287,L448541,u2502,m162,DAVID,Thanks ... I love you.
84288,L448540,u2496,m162,BETTY,"I'm so proud of you, Bud."
84289,L448539,u2502,m162,DAVID,... It's a pretty short trip.
84290,L448538,u2496,m162,BETTY,And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
84291,L448537,u2502,m162,DAVID,I won't.
84292,L448536,u2496,m162,BETTY,There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
84293,L448535,u2496,m162,BETTY,I had to say goodbye.
84294,L448534,u2502,m162,DAVID,Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
84295,L448533,u2496,m162,BETTY,I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
84296,L448090,u2502,m162,DAVID,Sure.
84297,L448089,u2496,m162,BETTY,Thank you.
84298,L448087,u2496,m162,BETTY,What?
84299,L448086,u2502,m162,DAVID,Wait.
84300,L448085,u2502,m162,DAVID,No ... They won't be able to tell.
84301,L448084,u2496,m162,BETTY,And they won't be able to tell?
84302,L448083,u2502,m162,DAVID,Looks just like it did.
84303,L448082,u2496,m162,BETTY,Does it look okay?
84304,L448079,u2496,m162,BETTY,In my handbag.
84305,L448078,u2502,m162,DAVID,Have you got any make up?
84306,L448076,u2496,m162,BETTY,I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
84307,L448075,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's okay. It's alright.
84308,L447848,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm fine.
84309,L447847,u2496,m162,BETTY,How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
84310,L447846,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh no ... I'm fine.
84311,L447833,u2502,m162,DAVID,"No, I ... I was just ... worried about her."
84312,L447832,u2496,m162,BETTY,Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
84313,L447648,u2502,m162,DAVID,It can't be possible.
84314,L447647,u2496,m162,BETTY,Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
84315,L447621,u2502,m162,DAVID,We're in Pleasantville?
84316,L447620,u2496,m162,BETTY,Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
84317,L448286,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
84318,L448285,u2496,m162,BETTY,Like a drum.
84319,L448284,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Yeah. It does.
84320,L448283,u2496,m162,BETTY,Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
84321,L448282,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,But you can't go out there.
84322,L448281,u2496,m162,BETTY,But I really should get home.
84323,L448280,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,You can't go out there.
84324,L448239,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,I don't know.
84325,L448238,u2496,m162,BETTY,What is that?
84326,L448197,u2496,m162,BETTY,No ...
84327,L448196,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,It's alright. Let me see.
84328,L448195,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,It's alright.
84329,L448194,u2496,m162,BETTY,I've got to go ...
84330,L448193,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Wait ...
84331,L448192,u2496,m162,BETTY,Yes she is.
84332,L448191,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,No she's not.
84333,L448190,u2496,m162,BETTY,She's crying.
84334,L448189,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,What?
84335,L448188,u2496,m162,BETTY,She's crying.
84336,L448187,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
84337,L448185,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Here's my favorite.
84338,L448184,u2496,m162,BETTY,Bud?
84339,L448183,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Bud brought it to me.
84340,L448182,u2496,m162,BETTY,Where'd you get this?
84341,L448179,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
84342,L448178,u2496,m162,BETTY,I think it looks nice.
84343,L448177,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Having kind of a tough time.
84344,L448175,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Thanks.
84345,L448174,u2496,m162,BETTY,I just thought ... It's beautiful.
84346,L448173,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"No, no ... Come on in."
84347,L448172,u2496,m162,BETTY,I'm sorry ...
84348,L448171,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"Oh, hi ..."
84349,L447860,u2496,m162,BETTY,Hello Bill.
84350,L447859,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"Oh, hello Betty."
84351,L448310,u2496,m162,BETTY,I'm gonna go now.
84352,L448309,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Where are you gonna go?
84353,L448308,u2496,m162,BETTY,I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
84354,L448306,u2496,m162,BETTY,No I'm not sweetie.
84355,L448305,u2504,m162,GEORGE,"Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table."
84356,L448304,u2496,m162,BETTY,I don't want it to go away.
84357,L448303,u2504,m162,GEORGE,It goes away ... It'll go away.
84358,L448302,u2496,m162,BETTY,I don't want to put on some make up ...
84359,L448301,u2504,m162,GEORGE,It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
84360,L448300,u2496,m162,BETTY,Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
84361,L448299,u2496,m162,BETTY,No I'm not.
84362,L448298,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Sure you are.
84363,L448297,u2496,m162,BETTY,"I told you, George. I'm not going."
84364,L448296,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
84365,L448295,u2504,m162,GEORGE,I was in a bowling-alley.
84366,L448294,u2496,m162,BETTY,I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
84367,L448293,u2504,m162,GEORGE,All night?
84368,L448292,u2496,m162,BETTY,I told you where I was.
84369,L447836,u2504,m162,GEORGE,But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
84370,L447835,u2496,m162,BETTY,"Oh, George ..."
84371,L447834,u2504,m162,GEORGE,"Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake."
84372,L447482,u2496,m162,BETTY,Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
84373,L447481,u2504,m162,GEORGE,"Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought."
84374,L447480,u2496,m162,BETTY,How was your day?
84375,L448386,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ..."
84376,L448385,u2497,m162,BIFF,"It's better, Mary Sue."
84377,L448384,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Don't! Just let go.
84378,L448211,u2497,m162,BIFF,With what?
84379,L448210,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I'm busy.
84380,L448209,u2497,m162,BIFF,Why not?
84381,L448208,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Oh.  I can't.
84382,L448207,u2497,m162,BIFF,We were gonna ... You know ...
84383,L448206,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,So.
84384,L448205,u2497,m162,BIFF,It's six-thirty ...
84385,L448204,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What are you doing?
84386,L448203,u2497,m162,BIFF,Mary Sue--C'mon ...
84387,L447843,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Trust me ...
84388,L447842,u2497,m162,BIFF,It is?
84389,L447841,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"It's s'posed to happen, Biff."
84390,L447839,u2497,m162,BIFF,I think ... I might be ill ...
84391,L447838,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,... Why?
84392,L447826,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Oh, Biff. You can ""pin"" me any time you want to."
84393,L447825,u2497,m162,BIFF,To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
84394,L447824,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
84395,L447823,u2497,m162,BIFF,Sure is pretty.
84396,L447817,u2497,m162,BIFF,Lover's Lane!
84397,L447816,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,... Lover's Lane.
84398,L447815,u2497,m162,BIFF,But where would we go?
84399,L447814,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
84400,L447813,u2497,m162,BIFF,What?
84401,L447812,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,You want to get out of here?
84402,L447811,u2497,m162,BIFF,Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
84403,L447802,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
84404,L447801,u2497,m162,BIFF,"I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?"
84405,L447800,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Oh, gosh no."
84406,L447799,u2497,m162,BIFF,"So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important."
84407,L447798,u2497,m162,BIFF,"Hunh?  Oh, right ..."
84408,L447797,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?"
84409,L447796,u2497,m162,BIFF,"... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on ""Our Town Hall."" Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about."
84410,L447790,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
84411,L447789,u2497,m162,BIFF,Oh yeah.
84412,L447788,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Really Biff? The keenest?
84413,L447787,u2497,m162,BIFF,"I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ..."
84414,L447786,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Well ""gee whizz"" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me."
84415,L447785,u2497,m162,BIFF,I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
84416,L447689,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Um ... It's ...
84417,L447688,u2497,m162,BIFF,What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
84418,L447900,u2497,m162,BIFF,"Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke."
84419,L447899,u2502,m162,DAVID,What'll it be?
84420,L447728,u2497,m162,BIFF,I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
84421,L447727,u2502,m162,DAVID,I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
84422,L447726,u2497,m162,BIFF,She won't go out with me?
84423,L447725,u2502,m162,DAVID,"What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little ""different"" lately ..."
84424,L447724,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ..."
84425,L447723,u2497,m162,BIFF,Yeah ... How'd you know?
84426,L447722,u2502,m162,DAVID,"You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ..."
84427,L447721,u2497,m162,BIFF,What's the matter?
84428,L447720,u2502,m162,DAVID,I don't believe it.
84429,L447719,u2497,m162,BIFF,What?
84430,L447718,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh God! Are we in that episode?
84431,L448509,u2498,m162,BIG BOB,No it couldn't!
84432,L448508,u2502,m162,DAVID,But it could happen.
84433,L448507,u2498,m162,BIG BOB,That's not going to happen!
84434,L448506,u2502,m162,DAVID,"C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ..."
84435,L448494,u2502,m162,DAVID,Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
84436,L448493,u2498,m162,BIG BOB,"Okay, that's IT!!!"
84437,L448492,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it ""love."""
84438,L448267,u2504,m162,GEORGE,"Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said ""Honey. I'm home."""
84439,L448266,u2499,m162,BOB,What happened?
84440,L448263,u2499,m162,BOB,Real rain?
84441,L448262,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Rain.
84442,L448261,u2499,m162,BOB,Are you alright?  What is it?
84443,L448067,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
84444,L448066,u2499,m162,BOB,"Why don't you start by saying ""yes,"" and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs."
84445,L448065,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
84446,L448064,u2499,m162,BOB,And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
84447,L448063,u2504,m162,GEORGE,No. Of course not.
84448,L448062,u2499,m162,BOB,"And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it."
84449,L448061,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Thank you very much.
84450,L448060,u2499,m162,BOB,No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
84451,L448055,u2504,m162,GEORGE,... How?
84452,L448054,u2499,m162,BOB,I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
84453,L448053,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
84454,L448052,u2504,m162,GEORGE,One of those ... big beds?
84455,L448051,u2499,m162,BOB,Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
84456,L448050,u2504,m162,GEORGE,No. What?
84457,L448049,u2499,m162,BOB,"""Changes.""  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?"
84458,L448048,u2504,m162,GEORGE,"""Changes."""
84459,L448047,u2499,m162,BOB,"I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain ""changes"" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by ""changes""?"
84460,L448045,u2499,m162,BOB,I'm fine--but thank you.
84461,L448044,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
84462,L448043,u2499,m162,BOB,"Oh, no thanks ..."
84463,L448042,u2504,m162,GEORGE,Want some bridge mix?
84464,L448504,u2499,m162,BOB,No it isn't.
84465,L448503,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh sure it is.
84466,L448502,u2499,m162,BOB,It's not in ME.
84467,L448501,u2502,m162,DAVID,But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
84468,L448500,u2499,m162,BOB,THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
84469,L448499,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
84470,L448498,u2499,m162,BOB,BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
84471,L448497,u2502,m162,DAVID,Why am I out of order?
84472,L448496,u2499,m162,BOB,YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
84473,L448476,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
84474,L448475,u2499,m162,BOB,You're not allowed to lie.
84475,L448474,u2502,m162,DAVID,I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
84476,L448473,u2499,m162,BOB,Okay--that's enough!
84477,L448472,u2502,m162,DAVID,"See, I know you want it to stay ""Pleasant"" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ..."
84478,L448470,u2502,m162,DAVID,Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
84479,L448469,u2499,m162,BOB,The basketball team?
84480,L448468,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's like the basketball team.
84481,L448465,u2499,m162,BOB,Very well ...
84482,L448464,u2502,m162,DAVID,I think I've got something to say.
84483,L448461,u2499,m162,BOB,Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
84484,L448460,u2502,m162,DAVID,It was accessible to everyone.
84485,L448459,u2499,m162,BOB,"Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?"
84486,L448458,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well--it was dark out ...
84487,L448457,u2499,m162,BOB,Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
84488,L448456,u2499,m162,BOB,"We prefer to keep these proceedings as ""pleasant"" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary."
84489,L448455,u2502,m162,DAVID,Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
84490,L448454,u2499,m162,BOB,"Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta."
84491,L448423,u2502,m162,DAVID,Still doesn't make it right.
84492,L448422,u2499,m162,BOB,You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
84493,L448421,u2502,m162,DAVID,Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
84494,L448420,u2499,m162,BOB,BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
84495,L448419,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yes I do.
84496,L448418,u2499,m162,BOB,Do you know that it's illegal?
84497,L448417,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yes I did.
84498,L448416,u2499,m162,BOB,Did you do this?
84499,L448429,u2501,m162,DAN,"Oh. guess I could do that, then."
84500,L448428,u2499,m162,BOB,You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
84501,L448427,u2501,m162,DAN,"Well, I never had to do it before."
84502,L448426,u2499,m162,BOB,What do you mean!?
84503,L448425,u2501,m162,DAN,"Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob."
84504,L448424,u2499,m162,BOB,Dan! Arrest them!
84505,L448025,u2502,m162,DAVID,I thought the books were blank?
84506,L448024,u2500,m162,BOY,"""It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."""
84507,L448015,u2500,m162,BOY,What is it?
84508,L448014,u2502,m162,DAVID,Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
84509,L448013,u2500,m162,BOY,What's outside of Pleasantville?
84510,L448012,u2502,m162,DAVID,Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
84511,L448011,u2500,m162,BOY,And where's that?
84512,L448009,u2500,m162,BOY,How'd you know how to put it out and all?
84513,L448008,u2502,m162,DAVID,What?
84514,L448007,u2500,m162,BOY,How'd you know about the fire?
84515,L448483,u2502,m162,DAVID,The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
84516,L448482,u2510,m162,MR. SIMPSON,The other one?
84517,L448481,u2502,m162,DAVID,"No, not that hedge. The other one."

84526,L448520,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old."
84527,L448519,u2502,m162,DAVID,And you're sure about this?
84528,L448518,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Right here.
84529,L448517,u2502,m162,DAVID,You got the admissions letter.
84530,L448516,u2502,m162,DAVID,Honestly ... no.
84531,L448515,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
84532,L448514,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
84533,L448513,u2502,m162,DAVID,This thing works. We could go home right now.
84534,L448512,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I told you. I'm like positive.
84535,L448511,u2502,m162,DAVID,Are you sure?
84536,L448161,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What?
84537,L448160,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ..."
84538,L448159,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
84539,L448158,u2502,m162,DAVID,What?
84540,L448157,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,How come I'm still in black and white?
84541,L448156,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yes.
84542,L448155,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Can I ask you a question?
84543,L448154,u2502,m162,DAVID,Wow.
84544,L448153,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
84545,L448152,u2502,m162,DAVID,You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
84546,L448151,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,No. She really liked you.
84547,L448150,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
84548,L448149,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Yeah ...
84549,L448148,u2502,m162,DAVID,Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
84550,L448147,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Sure.
84551,L448146,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
84552,L448145,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,So what is it?
84553,L448144,u2502,m162,DAVID,That's great.
84554,L448143,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
84555,L448142,u2502,m162,DAVID,... Yeah.
84556,L448141,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
84557,L448140,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
84558,L448139,u2502,m162,DAVID,You're reading?
84559,L448137,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Nothing?
84560,L448136,u2502,m162,DAVID,Nothing.
84561,L448135,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What's wrong?
84562,L448029,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther."
84563,L448028,u2502,m162,DAVID,The pages filled in?
84564,L448027,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in."
84565,L448004,u2502,m162,DAVID,Sure.
84566,L448003,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
84567,L448002,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's fine.
84568,L448001,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Not directly anyhow ...
84569,L448000,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's okay.
84570,L447999,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I had nothing to do with that fire.
84571,L447902,u2502,m162,DAVID,Really? It seems so fattening.
84572,L447901,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Me too. Sounds swell.
84573,L447891,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
84574,L447890,u2502,m162,DAVID,They don't have that kind of potential.
84575,L447889,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be ""attractive."" They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better."
84576,L447888,u2502,m162,DAVID,I just don't think we have the right to ...
84577,L447887,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ..."
84578,L447886,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?"
84579,L447885,u2502,m162,DAVID,They're happy like this.
84580,L447884,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Well if I don't who will?
84581,L447883,u2502,m162,DAVID,You have no right to do this.
84582,L447879,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before."
84583,L447878,u2502,m162,DAVID,You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
84584,L447877,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy."
84585,L447876,u2502,m162,DAVID,"You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you."
84586,L447867,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Nothing.
84587,L447866,u2502,m162,DAVID,What did you do to him?
84588,L447810,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Gee whiz ""Bud"", what could we possibly need when we have each other?"
84589,L447809,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there."
84590,L447759,u2502,m162,DAVID,Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
84591,L447758,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
84592,L447757,u2502,m162,DAVID,Jen please ...
84593,L447756,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,So what's the point?
84594,L447755,u2502,m162,DAVID,They don't notice that kind of thing.
84595,L447754,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What do you mean?
84596,L447753,u2502,m162,DAVID,He won't notice anyway.
84597,L447752,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
84598,L447751,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's in your closet.
84599,L447750,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I could like kill a guy with these things.
84600,L447742,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
84601,L447741,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"I like--really need a cigarette, too."
84602,L447740,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Jen, listen ..."
84603,L447739,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ..."
84604,L447738,u2502,m162,DAVID,JENNIFER!
84605,L447737,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
84606,L447736,u2502,m162,DAVID,What were you doing in a library?
84607,L447735,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
84608,L447734,u2502,m162,DAVID,What?
84609,L447733,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
84610,L447732,u2502,m162,DAVID,"One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack."
84611,L447731,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,No way.
84612,L447699,u2502,m162,DAVID,I don't think so.
84613,L447698,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Can we do any better?
84614,L447697,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean."
84615,L447696,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Those are my friends.
84616,L447695,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Hunh.
84617,L447694,u2502,m162,DAVID,As a matter of fact he does.
84618,L447693,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Does he--you know--like ""me""?"
84619,L447692,u2502,m162,DAVID,Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
84620,L447691,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Who's that?
84621,L447684,u2502,m162,DAVID,To who?
84622,L447683,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
84623,L447682,u2502,m162,DAVID,We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
84624,L447681,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
84625,L447680,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue."
84626,L447679,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Play along?
84627,L447678,u2502,m162,DAVID,We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
84628,L447677,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!"
84629,L447676,u2502,m162,DAVID,Owns the hardware store.
84630,L447675,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,You know him?
84631,L447670,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
84632,L447669,u2502,m162,DAVID,We're supposed to be in school.
84633,L447668,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,I still don't see why we're doing this.
84634,L447667,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
84635,L447666,u2502,m162,DAVID,Just take deep breaths.
84636,L447665,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God."
84637,L447655,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Neither do I.
84638,L447654,u2502,m162,DAVID,I don't believe this.
84639,L447646,u2502,m162,DAVID,I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
84640,L447645,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What's going to happen?
84641,L447644,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh God.
84642,L447627,u2502,m162,DAVID,You--you gotta get us out of here.
84643,L447626,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Noooooo!
84644,L447612,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
84645,L447611,u2502,m162,DAVID,I don't know.
84646,L447610,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What did you do?
84647,L447608,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm not sure.
84648,L447607,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What happened?
84649,L447606,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh my God.
84650,L447605,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,YOU get lost!
84651,L447604,u2502,m162,DAVID,Get lost!
84652,L447603,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"God, David. Just give it to me!"
84653,L447600,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this."
84654,L447599,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
84655,L447596,u2502,m162,DAVID,No way.
84656,L447595,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Lemme see that.
84657,L447551,u2502,m162,DAVID,"No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote."
84658,L447550,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ..."
84659,L447549,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
84660,L447548,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
84661,L447547,u2502,m162,DAVID,Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
84662,L447546,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!"
84663,L447545,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah. Every episode ever.
84664,L447544,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Pleasantville Marathon?
84665,L447543,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
84666,L447542,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,"David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes."
84667,L447541,u2502,m162,DAVID,What are you doing?
84668,L447540,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What are you doing?
84669,L448526,u2502,m162,DAVID,I like it too.
84670,L448525,u2507,m162,MARGARET,I like calling you David.
84671,L448524,u2502,m162,DAVID,No I won't. I swear.
84672,L448523,u2507,m162,MARGARET,You're gonna forget about me.
84673,L448382,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm not sure.
84674,L448381,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Where are they?
84675,L448320,u2502,m162,DAVID,Sure ...
84676,L448319,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Can I open it?
84677,L448318,u2502,m162,DAVID,It was a prop for the school play ...
84678,L448317,u2507,m162,MARGARET,It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
84679,L448247,u2502,m162,DAVID,We'll just put up the top.
84680,L448246,u2507,m162,MARGARET,What do we do?
84681,L448244,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
84682,L448243,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Real rain?
84683,L448242,u2502,m162,DAVID,Rain.
84684,L448241,u2507,m162,MARGARET,What's going on?
84685,L448233,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
84686,L448232,u2502,m162,DAVID,They just grow like that?
84687,L448231,u2507,m162,MARGARET,I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
84688,L448230,u2502,m162,DAVID,Hunh?
84689,L448229,u2507,m162,MARGARET,You want some berries?
84690,L448228,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
84691,L448227,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
84692,L448226,u2507,m162,MARGARET,What's that like?
84693,L448225,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah.
84694,L448224,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
84695,L448223,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
84696,L448222,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
84697,L448221,u2507,m162,MARGARET,How?
84698,L448219,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Out there.

84702,L448215,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
84703,L448214,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Do they have those ... Where you come from?
84704,L448213,u2502,m162,DAVID,Mmmmgh.
84705,L448164,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh ... Right.
84706,L448163,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
84707,L448112,u2502,m162,DAVID,... Lover's Lane?
84708,L448111,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Sure ... Where would we go?
84709,L448109,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ..."
84710,L448108,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Oh ... Hi.
84711,L448107,u2502,m162,DAVID,Hi.
84712,L448021,u2502,m162,DAVID,Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
84713,L448020,u2507,m162,MARGARET,Keeps going ...
84714,L447996,u2507,m162,MARGARET,No. I baked them for you.
84715,L447995,u2502,m162,DAVID,No. You baked them for Whitey.
84716,L447994,u2507,m162,MARGARET,No. I baked them for you.
84717,L447993,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey."
84718,L447992,u2507,m162,MARGARET,I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
84719,L447991,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Oh. Thanks, Margaret."
84720,L447990,u2507,m162,MARGARET,That was sure swell ...
84721,L447515,u2502,m162,DAVID,Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
84722,L447514,u2505,m162,HOWARD,A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
84723,L447513,u2502,m162,DAVID,Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
84724,L447512,u2505,m162,HOWARD,You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
84725,L447509,u2502,m162,DAVID,Marmalade.
84726,L447508,u2505,m162,HOWARD,Scout?
84727,L447507,u2502,m162,DAVID,Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
84728,L447506,u2502,m162,DAVID,Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
84729,L447505,u2505,m162,HOWARD,"Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?"
84730,L448453,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
84731,L448452,u2502,m162,DAVID,There's worse places.
84732,L448451,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
84733,L448450,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm going on trial tomorrow?
84734,L448449,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down."
84735,L448447,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
84736,L448446,u2502,m162,DAVID,"I don't know ... Three, four weeks."
84737,L448445,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,How long do you think you've been here?
84738,L448444,u2502,m162,DAVID,They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
84739,L448443,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
84740,L448442,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm sorry. I can't do that.
84741,L448441,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Just gimme the damn remote!
84742,L448440,u2502,m162,DAVID,"So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ..."
84743,L448439,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
84744,L448438,u2502,m162,DAVID,Why don't you just take me back without it?
84745,L448437,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Because you're coming home.
84746,L448436,u2502,m162,DAVID,Why?
84747,L448435,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?"
84748,L448434,u2502,m162,DAVID,I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
84749,L448433,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Hope you're proud of yourself.
84750,L448368,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
84751,L448367,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm going to leave now.
84752,L448366,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,OW!
84753,L448365,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
84754,L448364,u2502,m162,DAVID,I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
84755,L448363,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,EXCUSE ME?
84756,L448362,u2502,m162,DAVID,No you're not.
84757,L448361,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
84758,L448360,u2502,m162,DAVID,Why?
84759,L448359,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Where's the remote control I gave you?
84760,L448356,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh no? Let me show you something!
84761,L448355,u2502,m162,DAVID,I didn't do anything wrong.
84762,L448354,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
84763,L448353,u2502,m162,DAVID,... Only if they mean it.
84764,L448352,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?"
84765,L448351,u2502,m162,DAVID,Look ...
84766,L448350,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?"
84767,L448349,u2502,m162,DAVID,I had nothing to do with that.
84768,L448348,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"A deluge doesn't just ""happen."" Bolts of lightning don't just ""happen"" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ..."
84769,L448347,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Look--it just sort of ""happened"" ..."
84770,L448346,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
84771,L448345,u2502,m162,DAVID,What do you mean?
84772,L448343,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,NOW!
84773,L448342,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh--well ...
84774,L448341,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,I want a word with you ...
84775,L448134,u2502,m162,DAVID,Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
84776,L448133,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,BUD.
84777,L448132,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?"
84778,L448131,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Excuse me?
84779,L448130,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just ""cookies"" after all ..."
84780,L448129,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
84781,L448128,u2502,m162,DAVID,Re-runs?
84782,L448127,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
84783,L448126,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my ""dad"" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ..."
84784,L448125,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
84785,L448124,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ..."
84786,L448123,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,What?
84787,L448122,u2502,m162,DAVID,I can't.
84788,L448121,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again."
84789,L448119,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Well c'mere, young fella."
84790,L448118,u2502,m162,DAVID,... Hi.
84791,L448117,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Hello there.
84792,L447643,u2502,m162,DAVID,COME BACK!!!
84793,L447642,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
84794,L447641,u2502,m162,DAVID,WAIT A MINUTE!!
84795,L447640,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
84796,L447639,u2502,m162,DAVID,Where are you going ...
84797,L447638,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
84798,L447637,u2502,m162,DAVID,Don't get upset.
84799,L447635,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
84800,L447634,u2502,m162,DAVID,Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
84801,L447631,u2502,m162,DAVID,My name's David.
84802,L447630,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Oh sure you do ... ""McIntire's Department store"" ... ""Their father dressed as Prince Charming."" That was gorgeous Bud."
84803,L447629,u2502,m162,DAVID,Because we don't belong!
84804,L447628,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Why would I do that?
84805,L447619,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
84806,L447618,u2502,m162,DAVID,What the hell's going on!
84807,L447617,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ..."
84808,L447588,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
84809,L447587,u2502,m162,DAVID,How much does it cost?
84810,L447585,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
84811,L447584,u2502,m162,DAVID,Ooomph?
84812,L447583,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more ""Ooomph"" in it."
84813,L447582,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,That's right.
84814,L447581,u2502,m162,DAVID,"No. McIntire's. Remember:  ""For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."""
84815,L447580,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,McGinty's.
84816,L447579,u2502,m162,DAVID,McIntire's.
84817,L447578,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,What department store did they go to?
84818,L447577,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah ...
84819,L447574,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Nice ... Nice ...
84820,L447573,u2502,m162,DAVID,... Like Prince Charming.
84821,L447572,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Right. And how did she dress him?
84822,L447571,u2502,m162,DAVID,... Her father.
84823,L447563,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?"
84824,L447562,u2502,m162,DAVID,"You know, we didn't call any TV repair."
84825,L447561,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
84826,L447560,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,We'll get you fixed up in no time.
84827,L447559,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah ... Sort of ...
84828,L447558,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
84829,L448532,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Just a little--You know.
84830,L448531,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's beautiful.
84831,L448528,u2502,m162,DAVID,You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
84832,L448527,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
84833,L448413,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
84834,L448412,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
84835,L448104,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"No, that's not it."
84836,L448103,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ..."
84837,L448102,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,I'll never be able to do that.
84838,L448101,u2502,m162,DAVID,What's wrong?
84839,L448097,u2502,m162,DAVID,Open it.
84840,L448096,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"Oh my Gosh, Bud ..."
84841,L448095,u2502,m162,DAVID,It's an art book.
84842,L448094,u2502,m162,DAVID,I brought you something ... From the library.
84843,L448093,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Aren't you a little early?
84844,L448092,u2502,m162,DAVID,Hi.
84845,L448091,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"Oh, hi."
84846,L447929,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
84847,L447928,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah.
84848,L447927,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Really?
84849,L447926,u2502,m162,DAVID,I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
84850,L447925,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Well don't you?
84851,L447924,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought ""Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"""
84852,L447923,u2502,m162,DAVID,Wow ... That's pretty good ...
84853,L447921,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Christmastime.
84854,L447920,u2502,m162,DAVID,... What's that?
84855,L447919,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,You know what I really like?
84856,L447918,u2502,m162,DAVID,So they can have their hamburgers!
84857,L447917,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Why?
84858,L447916,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway."
84859,L447915,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
84860,L447914,u2502,m162,DAVID,Forget about that!
84861,L447913,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ..."
84862,L447912,u2502,m162,DAVID,Just listen to me ...
84863,L447911,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ..."
84864,L447910,u2502,m162,DAVID,What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
84865,L447909,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
84866,L447906,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"Oh--what's the point, Bud?"
84867,L447905,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ..."
84868,L447904,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,There aren't any cheeseburgers.
84869,L447903,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes."
84870,L447857,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
84871,L447856,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah ...
84872,L447855,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors."
84873,L447854,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah ...
84874,L447853,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Bud ...
84875,L447852,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early."
84876,L447851,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
84877,L447850,u2502,m162,DAVID,Oh hi!
84878,L447783,u2502,m162,DAVID,"Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along."
84879,L447782,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Yes.
84880,L447781,u2502,m162,DAVID,Have you cooked the burgers?
84881,L447780,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,... Yeah.
84882,L447779,u2502,m162,DAVID,Do you have the lettuce?
84883,L447778,u2502,m162,DAVID,Listen to me!
84884,L447777,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,"Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ..."
84885,L447776,u2502,m162,DAVID,What?
84886,L447775,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,There aren't any cheeseburgers.

84888,L447770,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,I'm so glad you're here.
84889,L447769,u2502,m162,DAVID,"You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet."
84890,L447767,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
84891,L447766,u2502,m162,DAVID,Yeah ...
84892,L447765,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
84893,L447764,u2502,m162,DAVID,What's wrong?
84894,L447762,u2509,m162,MR. JOHNSON,Oh.

84903,L447615,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,What happened?
84904,L447614,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
84905,L447590,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
84906,L447589,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Free?
84907,L447576,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
84908,L447575,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
84909,L447570,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
84910,L447569,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
84911,L447568,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,"Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years."
84912,L447565,u2503,m162,DICK VAN DYKE,What's the rush?
84913,L447564,u2506,m162,JENNIFER,You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.

84928,L454746,u2517,m163,KAREN,Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
84929,L454745,u2511,m163,BARRY,"No, no, no."
84930,L454744,u2517,m163,KAREN,Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
84931,L454638,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Ok, bye-bye."
84932,L454637,u2517,m163,KAREN,Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
84933,L454636,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes, I'll be there."
84934,L454635,u2517,m163,KAREN,"You just fucking said ""chat,"" that is so -- what are you now? ""chat."" I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight."
84935,L454634,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Well, I can't talk though --"
84936,L454633,u2517,m163,KAREN,"""chat?"" Did you just say ""chat?"""
84937,L454632,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now."
84938,L454631,u2517,m163,KAREN,So you can't talk to me?
84939,L454630,u2511,m163,BARRY,I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
84940,L454629,u2517,m163,KAREN,Yeah but what are you doing?
84941,L454628,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Hello, Karen. I'm just working."
84942,L454627,u2517,m163,KAREN,"Hey it's me, what are you doing?"
84943,L454626,u2511,m163,BARRY,This is Barry.
84944,L455475,u2511,m163,BARRY,D&D Mattress Man.
84945,L455474,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,What's the listing?
84946,L455473,u2511,m163,BARRY,Somewhere in Utah.
84947,L455472,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,What city?
84948,L454561,u2511,m163,BARRY,Ok. Thank you.
84949,L454560,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
84950,L454557,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
84951,L454556,u2511,m163,BARRY,Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
84952,L454555,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,That's it.
84953,L454554,u2511,m163,BARRY,"So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --"
84954,L454553,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,"I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake."
84955,L454552,u2511,m163,BARRY,It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
84956,L454551,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,"This is ""Fly With Us?"""
84957,L454550,u2511,m163,BARRY,I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
84958,L454549,u2523,m163,OPERATOR,And what was this?
84959,L454548,u2511,m163,BARRY,...yes I'm still on hold...
84960,L455348,u2511,m163,BARRY,"-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't."
84961,L455347,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"-- what are you talking about, come on --"
84962,L455346,u2511,m163,BARRY,"There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --"
84963,L455345,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Tell me why.
84964,L455344,u2511,m163,BARRY,I just want to know where she's staying.
84965,L455343,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,What? Tell me why you wanna know --
84966,L455342,u2511,m163,BARRY,I....please don't do this.
84967,L455341,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,No she didn't; that's a lie.
84968,L455340,u2511,m163,BARRY,......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
84969,L455339,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?"
84970,L455338,u2511,m163,BARRY,Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
84971,L455337,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,You're so scared.
84972,L455336,u2511,m163,BARRY,"....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?"
84973,L455335,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --"
84974,L455334,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?"
84975,L455333,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Hey. What are you doing?
84976,L455045,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Call me later.
84977,L455044,u2511,m163,BARRY,Goodbye.

84979,L455039,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Why's it here?
84980,L455038,u2511,m163,BARRY,It's not mine.
84981,L455037,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,What's all this pudding?
84982,L455034,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,OH MY GOD. Look at that.
84983,L455033,u2511,m163,BARRY,Yeah I can't.
84984,L454989,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird."
84985,L454988,u2511,m163,BARRY,I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
84986,L454987,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?"
84987,L454986,u2511,m163,BARRY,What?
84988,L454985,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:"
84989,L454984,u2511,m163,BARRY,I don't know.
84990,L454983,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
84991,L454982,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --"
84992,L454981,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"You don't do anything, why are you being scared?"
84993,L454980,u2511,m163,BARRY,I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
84994,L454979,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Are you gonna do it?
84995,L454978,u2511,m163,BARRY,I feel really on the spot now.
84996,L454977,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,-- do you think you'll ask her out?
84997,L454976,u2511,m163,BARRY,"It's fine, but --"
84998,L454975,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,It's not cool?
84999,L454972,u2511,m163,BARRY,I'm gonna call you back.
85000,L454971,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?"
85001,L454931,u2511,m163,BARRY,I'm sorry.
85002,L454930,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said."
85003,L454929,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I have work, I can't leave."
85004,L454928,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Why?
85005,L454927,u2511,m163,BARRY,Yeah I can't.
85006,L454926,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go."
85007,L454921,u2511,m163,BARRY,I don't know.
85008,L454920,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?"
85009,L454764,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I'm not, I'm very happy."
85010,L454763,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,You look nervous.
85011,L454762,u2511,m163,BARRY,No.
85012,L454761,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
85013,L454760,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you."
85014,L454759,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
85015,L454755,u2511,m163,BARRY,Did I say that?
85016,L454754,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,You just said very food.
85017,L454743,u2511,m163,BARRY,Hello everyone.
85018,L454742,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
85019,L454713,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
85020,L454712,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Well, yeah, thank you, but --"
85021,L454711,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

85023,L454709,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,I'm trying to be your friend.
85024,L454708,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --"
85025,L454707,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
85026,L454706,u2511,m163,BARRY,"...please, I just don't want it...."
85027,L454705,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,She's really cute and she's really nice.
85028,L454704,u2511,m163,BARRY,Please don't.
85029,L454703,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,So it's ok if I bring her.
85030,L454702,u2511,m163,BARRY,I don't think I'm going to the party.
85031,L454701,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,That's your fault not mine.
85032,L454700,u2511,m163,BARRY,Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
85033,L454699,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to."
85034,L454698,u2511,m163,BARRY,Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
85035,L454697,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you."
85036,L454696,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yeah, but please don't do that."
85037,L454695,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
85038,L454694,u2511,m163,BARRY,Well I don't want to do something like that.
85039,L454693,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Why?
85040,L454692,u2511,m163,BARRY,Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
85041,L454691,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight."
85042,L454690,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes, indeed, yes I am."
85043,L454689,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"So you're coming tonight, right?"

85056,L454965,u2511,m163,BARRY,This is not cool.

85067,L454946,u2526,m163,SEXY VOICE,I need help.
85068,L454945,u2511,m163,BARRY,This makes me very uncomfortable.
85069,L454944,u2526,m163,SEXY VOICE,"See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --"

85265,L455196,u2521,m163,LENA,Ok.
85266,L455195,u2511,m163,BARRY,I have a better idea of where we can go.
85267,L455194,u2511,m163,BARRY,Nothing.
85268,L455193,u2521,m163,LENA,What did he want?
85269,L455192,u2511,m163,BARRY,Nothing.
85270,L455191,u2521,m163,LENA,What happened?
85271,L455190,u2511,m163,BARRY,Yes.
85272,L455189,u2521,m163,LENA,Is everything ok?
85273,L455148,u2521,m163,LENA,"Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?"
85274,L455147,u2511,m163,BARRY,"My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --"
85275,L455146,u2521,m163,LENA,I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
85276,L455145,u2511,m163,BARRY,No I didn't say that.
85277,L455144,u2521,m163,LENA,I'm sorry. I thought you said --
85278,L455143,u2511,m163,BARRY,....No....
85279,L455142,u2521,m163,LENA,So that was your pudding?
85280,L455141,u2511,m163,BARRY,....yeah....
85281,L455140,u2521,m163,LENA,"That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding."
85282,L455139,u2511,m163,BARRY,"You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles."
85283,L455138,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah, no, I see --"
85284,L455137,u2511,m163,BARRY,You see?
85285,L455136,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah.
85286,L455135,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?"
85287,L455134,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah.
85288,L455133,u2511,m163,BARRY,"-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?"
85289,L455132,u2521,m163,LENA,You were talking about the promotion --
85290,L455131,u2511,m163,BARRY,"....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying...."
85291,L455130,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah?
85292,L455129,u2511,m163,BARRY,"So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing....."
85293,L455128,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah.
85294,L455127,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?"
85295,L455126,u2521,m163,LENA,"No, no. I did."
85296,L455125,u2511,m163,BARRY,Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
85297,L455124,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
85298,L455123,u2511,m163,BARRY,You like her?
85299,L455122,u2521,m163,LENA,About six months.
85300,L455121,u2511,m163,BARRY,How long have you known her?
85301,L455120,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah.
85302,L455119,u2511,m163,BARRY,That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
85303,L455118,u2521,m163,LENA,...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
85304,L455117,u2511,m163,BARRY,...really? That's nice...are you lying?
85305,L455114,u2511,m163,BARRY,It's Barry.
85306,L455113,u2521,m163,LENA,Who is it?
85307,L455060,u2511,m163,BARRY,....Hi.....
85308,L455059,u2521,m163,LENA,....Hi.....
85309,L455058,u2511,m163,BARRY,Alright?
85310,L455057,u2521,m163,LENA,Ok.
85311,L455056,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem."
85312,L455055,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah.
85313,L455054,u2511,m163,BARRY,This is funny.
85314,L455053,u2511,m163,BARRY,Sure.
85315,L455052,u2521,m163,LENA,Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
85316,L455051,u2511,m163,BARRY,Sure.
85317,L455050,u2521,m163,LENA,Do you want to pick me up?
85318,L455049,u2511,m163,BARRY,Sure.
85319,L455048,u2521,m163,LENA,I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
85320,L455036,u2511,m163,BARRY,Ok.
85321,L455035,u2521,m163,LENA,"It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --"
85322,L455029,u2511,m163,BARRY,"-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it."
85323,L455028,u2521,m163,LENA,"-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --"
85324,L455027,u2511,m163,BARRY,-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
85325,L455026,u2521,m163,LENA,"-- well, if you're gonna go --"
85326,L455025,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --"
85327,L455024,u2521,m163,LENA,Really?
85328,L455023,u2511,m163,BARRY,That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
85329,L455020,u2511,m163,BARRY,Are you guys hurt?
85330,L455019,u2521,m163,LENA,"Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?"
85331,L455018,u2511,m163,BARRY,It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
85332,L455017,u2521,m163,LENA,Oh My God.
85333,L455016,u2511,m163,BARRY,That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
85334,L455015,u2521,m163,LENA,What do you do with all this pudding?
85335,L455014,u2521,m163,LENA,"It's terrible, no."
85336,L455013,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great."
85337,L455012,u2521,m163,LENA,No. I'm the exact opposite --
85338,L455011,u2511,m163,BARRY,Do you have brothers or sisters?
85339,L455010,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice."
85340,L455009,u2521,m163,LENA,I saw a picture of you.
85341,L455008,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yeah, not really."
85342,L455007,u2521,m163,LENA,"Business is good, you're busy?"
85343,L455001,u2511,m163,BARRY,No. Not at all. It's nice.
85344,L455000,u2521,m163,LENA,It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
85345,L454999,u2511,m163,BARRY,"It's fine. It was fun, though."
85346,L454998,u2521,m163,LENA,"I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --"
85347,L454925,u2511,m163,BARRY,Yes I do.
85348,L454924,u2521,m163,LENA,"Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday."
85349,L454923,u2511,m163,BARRY,Hi.

85351,L454593,u2511,m163,BARRY,Ok.
85352,L454592,u2521,m163,LENA,"Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?"
85353,L454591,u2511,m163,BARRY,Thank you.
85354,L454590,u2521,m163,LENA,Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
85355,L454589,u2511,m163,BARRY,Yeah.
85356,L454588,u2521,m163,LENA,There's a piano in the street.
85357,L454587,u2511,m163,BARRY,I think that'll be fine.
85358,L454586,u2521,m163,LENA,"You think it's ok where I left it, right there?"
85359,L454585,u2521,m163,LENA,"Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok."
85360,L454584,u2511,m163,BARRY,Not very well.

85363,L454581,u2521,m163,LENA,I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
85364,L454580,u2511,m163,BARRY,I don't know.
85365,L454579,u2521,m163,LENA,Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
85366,L454578,u2511,m163,BARRY,They don't get opened until eight.
85367,L454577,u2521,m163,LENA,They're not open yet?
85368,L454576,u2511,m163,BARRY,No.
85369,L454575,u2521,m163,LENA,Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

85376,L454568,u2511,m163,BARRY,If you wanted to call me back I could...

One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop."
85634,L455100,u2514,m163,DAVID,It's....whatever....that's not cool.
85635,L455099,u2515,m163,DEAN,-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
85636,L455098,u2514,m163,DAVID,I thought Latisha said you would --
85637,L455097,u2515,m163,DEAN,Your expenses are your own.
85638,L455086,u2515,m163,DEAN,"I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling."
85639,L455085,u2514,m163,DAVID,As soon as you want.
85640,L455084,u2515,m163,DEAN,When can you leave?
85641,L455083,u2514,m163,DAVID,That's cool.
85642,L455453,u2515,m163,DEAN,"Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --"
85643,L455452,u2520,m163,LATISHA,"No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --"
85644,L455451,u2515,m163,DEAN,Put him through.
85645,L455450,u2520,m163,LATISHA,Nothing.
85646,L455449,u2515,m163,DEAN,What did you say?
85647,L455448,u2520,m163,LATISHA,"Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --"
85648,L455447,u2515,m163,DEAN,Hello?
85649,L455105,u2520,m163,LATISHA,"You don't need to talk all macho, ""shake him out, little bad boy."" Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --"
85650,L455104,u2515,m163,DEAN,What's the problem?
85651,L455103,u2520,m163,LATISHA,"Uch. Shut up, Dean."
85652,L455102,u2515,m163,DEAN,"...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --"
85653,L455082,u2515,m163,DEAN,I'm only paying two of you guys.
85654,L455081,u2520,m163,LATISHA,So they'll go.
85655,L455414,u2521,m163,LENA,Ok.
85656,L455413,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,I'll just see you when you get back here.
85657,L455412,u2521,m163,LENA,Should I call you later?
85658,L455411,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"I think he's weird, but that's me."
85659,L455410,u2521,m163,LENA,I'm sorry. You're right.
85660,L455409,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"Well...he's not that strange, don't say that."
85661,L455408,u2521,m163,LENA,He did seem a little strange.
85662,L455407,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes."
85663,L455406,u2521,m163,LENA,It's fine.
85664,L455405,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
85665,L455404,u2521,m163,LENA,No.
85666,L455403,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,So...did my brother call you?
85667,L455402,u2521,m163,LENA,Ok.
85668,L455401,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Just tell him to call me.
85669,L455400,u2521,m163,LENA,Ok. What should I do about Eric?
85670,L455399,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
85671,L455047,u2521,m163,LENA,Ok.
85672,L455046,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
85673,L455043,u2521,m163,LENA,"Bye, Barry."
85674,L455042,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
85675,L455041,u2521,m163,LENA,Are you ready?
85676,L455032,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Are you coming to eat with us?
85677,L455031,u2521,m163,LENA,You ready?
85678,L455030,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?"
85679,L454993,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said."
85680,L454992,u2521,m163,LENA,We should be going --
85681,L454963,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Sorry.
85682,L454962,u2521,m163,LENA,"It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car."
85683,L454961,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --"
85684,L454960,u2521,m163,LENA,"It's not bad, it's ok."
85685,L454959,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --"
85686,L454958,u2521,m163,LENA,Yeah.
85687,L454957,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Are you sure?
85688,L454956,u2521,m163,LENA,I'll go pay for my car.
85689,L454933,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
85690,L454932,u2521,m163,LENA,It's ok. That's alright.
85691,L454919,u2521,m163,LENA,It's fine.
85692,L454918,u2516,m163,ELIZABETH,"He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --"
85693,L457288,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion."
85694,L457287,u2529,m164,ABBE DU MAUPAS,"My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor."
85695,L457286,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution."
85696,L457280,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory."
85697,L457279,u2529,m164,ABBE DU MAUPAS,I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
85698,L457278,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
85699,L457277,u2529,m164,ABBE DU MAUPAS,"It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile."
85700,L457276,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,-- and the listless ones do the binding.
85701,L457271,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
85702,L457270,u2529,m164,ABBE DU MAUPAS,"I'm pleased to have the new post, sir."
85703,L457269,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas."
85704,L456504,u2530,m164,CHARLOTTE,"I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think."
85705,L456503,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --"
85706,L456497,u2530,m164,CHARLOTTE,Then what's he doing here?
85707,L456496,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"He's a writer, not a madman."
85708,L456495,u2530,m164,CHARLOTTE,"I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth."
85709,L456494,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Once or twice.
85710,L456493,u2530,m164,CHARLOTTE,"You've been to his quarters, haven't you?"
85711,L456490,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,No one's forcing you to listen.
85712,L456489,u2530,m164,CHARLOTTE,We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
85713,L456488,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"""And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"""
85714,L457175,u2531,m164,CLEANTE,"""...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."""
85715,L457174,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"""To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"""
85716,L457170,u2531,m164,CLEANTE,"""With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"""
85717,L457169,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"""With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"""
85718,L457154,u2531,m164,CLEANTE,"""One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."""
85719,L457153,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"""One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."""
85720,L457138,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Now give the signal.
85721,L457137,u2531,m164,CLEANTE,"At your service, Count."
85722,L457136,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones."
85723,L457135,u2531,m164,CLEANTE,I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
85724,L457134,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?"
85725,L457133,u2531,m164,CLEANTE,Marquis? Is that you?
85726,L457131,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching."
85727,L457130,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --"
85728,L457099,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"You'll hate me now, won't you?"
85729,L457098,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Don't come back, not tonight, not again --"
85730,L457097,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,What? What've I done?
85731,L457096,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Go back to your room. Quickly.
85732,L457094,u2532,m164,COULMIER,They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
85733,L457093,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Why not?
85734,L457092,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice."
85735,L457091,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Mother's not half so blind as you.
85736,L457090,u2532,m164,COULMIER,By whom? The Marquis?
85737,L457089,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
85738,L457088,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"""Turn you out?"""
85739,L457087,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"Don't turn us out, Abbe."
85740,L457069,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"I've you to look after me, haven't I?"
85741,L457068,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
85742,L457067,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Is that a promise you can truly keep?
85743,L457066,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --"
85744,L457065,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --"
85745,L457064,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
85746,L457063,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"In part, yes."
85747,L457015,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life."
85748,L457014,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?"
85749,L457013,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess."
85750,L457012,u2532,m164,COULMIER,But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
85751,L457011,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Ow!
85752,L457010,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest."
85753,L457009,u2532,m164,COULMIER,But why must you indulge in his pornography?
85754,L457008,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
85755,L457007,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read."
85756,L457000,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Not now, or we're both done for."
85757,L456999,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --"
85758,L456763,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all."
85759,L456762,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Has he hurt you?
85760,L456548,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead."
85761,L456547,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"Yes, Abbe?"
85762,L456546,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Madeleine --
85763,L456486,u2532,m164,COULMIER,We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
85764,L456485,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?"
85765,L457263,u2532,m164,COULMIER,You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
85766,L457262,u2545,m164,VALCOUR,I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
85767,L457261,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I must grant him his last rites.
85768,L457260,u2545,m164,VALCOUR,"Mustn't do that, sir."
85769,L457259,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Free his mouth.
85770,L456566,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more."
85771,L456565,u2545,m164,VALCOUR,"They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger."
85772,L457244,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Of course.
85773,L457243,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Surely you'll grant me a final word.
85774,L457242,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I'm here.
85775,L457241,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Abbe de Coulmier!
85776,L457238,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue."
85777,L457237,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
85778,L457233,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin."
85779,L457232,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --"
85780,L457231,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Then it must've been love --
85781,L457230,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,NEVER!
85782,L457229,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Was it impotence?
85783,L457228,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Who's to say I did not?
85784,L457227,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Why was it you never took her by force?
85785,L457226,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Go to hell!
85786,L457225,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged."
85787,L457224,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
85788,L457223,u2532,m164,COULMIER,AND DID YOU?
85789,L457222,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!"
85790,L457221,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"I know, because I felt it myself --"
85791,L457220,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Don't confuse one organ with another --
85792,L457219,u2532,m164,COULMIER,-- the passion in your heart --
85793,L457218,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,-- that was lust --
85794,L457217,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I saw the longing in your eye --
85795,L457216,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --"
85796,L457215,u2532,m164,COULMIER,It's no secret that you loved her.
85797,L457214,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?"
85798,L457213,u2532,m164,COULMIER,An innocent child is dead.
85799,L457212,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!"
85800,L457211,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Your words drove Bouchon to --
85801,L457210,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?"
85802,L456987,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Your wig. Remove your wig.
85803,L456986,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man."
85804,L456980,u2532,m164,COULMIER,NOW STRIP.
85805,L456979,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!"
85806,L456978,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!"
85807,L456977,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Coulmier, you animal!"
85808,L456976,u2532,m164,COULMIER,OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
85809,L456975,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
85810,L456974,u2532,m164,COULMIER,You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
85811,L456973,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,A night spent with the partner of my choice.
85812,L456972,u2532,m164,COULMIER,What on earth would that require?
85813,L456971,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily."
85814,L456970,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!"
85815,L456969,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,A man after my own heart...
85816,L456968,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive."
85817,L456937,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe."
85818,L456936,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --"
85819,L456935,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
85820,L456934,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Because your writing continues, unchecked."
85821,L456933,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
85822,L456932,u2532,m164,COULMIER,-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
85823,L456931,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,-- water! --
85824,L456930,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --"
85825,L456929,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!"
85826,L456925,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Valcour. His chair.
85827,L456924,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --"
85828,L456923,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
85829,L456922,u2532,m164,COULMIER,His rug.
85830,L456921,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?"
85831,L456799,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,THEN BUGGER ME!
85832,L456798,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Good day, Marquis."
85833,L456797,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw."
85834,L456796,u2532,m164,COULMIER,That's enough.
85835,L456795,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"""Part the gates of heaven,"" as it were --"
85836,L456794,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
85837,L456793,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
85838,L456792,u2532,m164,COULMIER,You always do.
85839,L456791,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,I have a proposition.
85840,L456790,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
85841,L456789,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
85842,L456788,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur."
85843,L456787,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
85844,L456786,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written."
85845,L456785,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur."
85846,L456784,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
85847,L456783,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
85848,L456781,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice."
85849,L456780,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,What the devil --
85850,L456779,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw."
85851,L456778,u2532,m164,COULMIER,How can one man possibly be so selfish?
85852,L456777,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,He can't do that to me.
85853,L456765,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
85854,L456764,u2532,m164,COULMIER,You mean to take us all down with you?
85855,L456665,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?"
85856,L456664,u2532,m164,COULMIER,If you only mean to dupe me again --
85857,L456661,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Do I have your word?
85858,L456660,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill."
85859,L456658,u2532,m164,COULMIER,You among them?
85860,L456657,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended."
85861,L456656,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --"
85862,L456655,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Mightier than the sword indeed.
85863,L456654,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
85864,L456653,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,They can't be serious.
85865,L456652,u2532,m164,COULMIER,More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
85866,L456651,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?"
85867,L456650,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!"
85868,L456649,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine."
85869,L456648,u2532,m164,COULMIER,But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
85870,L456647,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"It's a fiction, not a moral treatise."
85871,L456646,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?"
85872,L456645,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die."
85873,L456644,u2532,m164,COULMIER,And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
85874,L456643,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,There I was taxed; it's true.
85875,L456642,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like ""nipple"" and ""pikestaff"" --"
85876,L456641,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,And --?
85877,L456640,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Enough to discern its tenor.
85878,L456639,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
85879,L456638,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!"
85880,L456637,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --"
85881,L456636,u2532,m164,COULMIER,What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
85882,L456635,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --"
85883,L456563,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I'll fill page after page, I promise."
85884,L456562,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life."
85885,L456561,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Don't be so sure.
85886,L456560,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption."
85887,L456559,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?"
85888,L456558,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters."
85889,L456557,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink."
85890,L456556,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --"
85891,L456555,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?"
85892,L456551,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated."
85893,L456550,u2532,m164,COULMIER,It's not even noon --
85894,L456549,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?"
85895,L457293,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --"
85896,L457292,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
85897,L457253,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again."
85898,L457252,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Will you sleep soundly tonight?
85899,L457251,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
85900,L457250,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,And you? It must've been an ordeal.
85901,L457249,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Poorly.
85902,L457248,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,How is the patient faring?
85903,L457247,u2532,m164,COULMIER,And my own.
85904,L457246,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"My, my. You have exceeded my expectations."
85905,L457206,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"HER NAME, ABBE."
85906,L457205,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it."
85907,L457204,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
85908,L457203,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?"
85909,L457202,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"As you say, Doctor."
85910,L457002,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,You'd suffer in her stead?
85911,L457001,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"If only blood will appease you, then shed mine."
85912,L456996,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
85913,L456995,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,This child let loose the beast from its cage --
85914,L456994,u2532,m164,COULMIER,It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
85915,L456993,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,He'll do no such thing.
85916,L456909,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,What could cause a tincture like this?
85917,L456908,u2532,m164,COULMIER,You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
85918,L456775,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum."
85919,L456774,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I'll do everything in my power --
85920,L456773,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
85921,L456772,u2532,m164,COULMIER,That's not our intent --
85922,L456771,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --"
85923,L456770,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,No. It most certainly was not.
85924,L456769,u2532,m164,COULMIER,It was not inspired by circumstance.
85925,L456768,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Of course.
85926,L456767,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"It was fiction, of course."
85927,L456724,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Oh indeed?
85928,L456723,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
85929,L456676,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
85930,L456675,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I have.
85931,L456674,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --"
85932,L456673,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --"
85933,L456672,u2532,m164,COULMIER,He's sworn to obedience.
85934,L456671,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,And --?
85935,L456670,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
85936,L456669,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Well?
85937,L456626,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
85938,L456625,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,And place my reputation at stake?
85939,L456624,u2532,m164,COULMIER,On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
85940,L456623,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"You find this amusing, do you?"
85941,L456622,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent."
85942,L456621,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,You're a sentimental man.
85943,L456620,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?"
85944,L456619,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
85945,L456618,u2532,m164,COULMIER,But he's one among some two hundred wards --
85946,L456617,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here."
85947,L456616,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Shut down?
85948,L456615,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor."
85949,L456614,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Yes?
85950,L456613,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions."
85951,L456612,u2532,m164,COULMIER,I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
85952,L456611,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?"
85953,L456610,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"You have to believe me, I had no idea --"
85954,L456608,u2532,m164,COULMIER,For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
85955,L456607,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Do you favor its publication?
85956,L456606,u2532,m164,COULMIER,It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
85957,L456605,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Well...?
85958,L456604,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Oh. That.
85959,L456603,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,And his writing?
85960,L456602,u2532,m164,COULMIER,He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
85961,L456601,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
85962,L456600,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --"
85963,L456599,u2532,m164,COULMIER,A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
85964,L456598,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,And he's never once attempted escape?
85965,L456597,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
85966,L456596,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,His wife's?
85967,L456595,u2532,m164,COULMIER,His wife's influence.
85968,L456594,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?"
85969,L456589,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
85970,L456588,u2532,m164,COULMIER,He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
85971,L456587,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation."
85972,L456586,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --"
85973,L456585,u2532,m164,COULMIER,A few indiscretions in his youth.
85974,L456584,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
85975,L456577,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
85976,L456576,u2532,m164,COULMIER,If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
85977,L456575,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
85978,L456574,u2532,m164,COULMIER,"You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain."
85979,L456573,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,It's a formality; truly.
85980,L456572,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Of course.
85981,L456571,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?"
85982,L456570,u2532,m164,COULMIER,Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
85983,L456471,u2533,m164,DELBEN,No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
85984,L456470,u2540,m164,NAPOLEON,Yes?
85985,L456469,u2533,m164,DELBEN,"Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed..."
85986,L456468,u2540,m164,NAPOLEON,But I am history.
85987,L456467,u2533,m164,DELBEN,"A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot."
85988,L456466,u2540,m164,NAPOLEON,As for the author... shoot him.
85989,L456464,u2540,m164,NAPOLEON,Enough!
85990,L456463,u2533,m164,DELBEN,"""As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"""
85991,L456697,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben; I look to the future."
85992,L456696,u2533,m164,DELBEN,"His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  ""There but for the grace of God""... eh, Doctor?"
85993,L456482,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Do you know how I define ""idealism,"" Monsieur Delben?"
85994,L456481,u2533,m164,DELBEN,I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
85995,L456480,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?"
85996,L456476,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission."
85997,L456475,u2533,m164,DELBEN,Quite.
85998,L456474,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
85999,L456902,u2534,m164,HORSEMAN,"Sweet, then? Like the pastry?"
86000,L456901,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
86001,L456457,u2534,m164,HORSEMAN,Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
86002,L456456,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,I'll be waiting.
86003,L456455,u2534,m164,HORSEMAN,"I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold."
86004,L456454,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"I'll pass the word on, then."
86005,L456453,u2534,m164,HORSEMAN,"Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough."
86006,L456452,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Here it is; the last chapter.
86007,L456760,u2536,m164,LIBERTINE,"I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!"
86008,L456759,u2535,m164,INGENUE,"What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?"
86009,L456758,u2536,m164,LIBERTINE,"And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!"
86010,L456757,u2535,m164,INGENUE,I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
86011,L456756,u2536,m164,LIBERTINE,"I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry ""no more!"""
86012,L456754,u2535,m164,INGENUE,Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
86013,L456753,u2536,m164,LIBERTINE,"My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!"
86014,L456746,u2535,m164,INGENUE,"Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!"
86015,L456745,u2536,m164,LIBERTINE,"Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!"
86016,L456738,u2535,m164,INGENUE,Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
86017,L456737,u2536,m164,LIBERTINE,"At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!"
86018,L457062,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?"
86019,L457061,u2537,m164,MADAME LECLERC,"You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?"
86020,L456911,u2537,m164,MADAME LECLERC,"Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy."
86021,L456910,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
86022,L456900,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"""Well worth the dig!"""
86023,L456899,u2537,m164,MADAME LECLERC,Yes?
86024,L456898,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"""The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."""
86025,L456897,u2537,m164,MADAME LECLERC,"Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on."
86026,L456896,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"""A habitu of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."""
86027,L456894,u2537,m164,MADAME LECLERC,"Come now, darling, give it a read."
86028,L456893,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"It's not your cup of tea, Mama."
86029,L456892,u2537,m164,MADAME LECLERC,"If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all."
86030,L457159,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"""What shall I ready?"" asked Fanchon. ""My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"""
86031,L457158,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"...yes, I've got that bit..."
86032,L457126,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air..."
86033,L457125,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
86034,L457124,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
86035,L457123,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!"
86036,L457122,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
86037,L457121,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --"
86038,L457120,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Go on, child."
86039,L457119,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
86040,L457118,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
86041,L457117,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?"
86042,L457116,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,It needn't be; not if you've another story.
86043,L457114,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it."
86044,L457113,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
86045,L457112,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --"
86046,L457111,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --"
86047,L457110,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"You're far crueler than I, my sweet."
86048,L457109,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations."
86049,L457108,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,It's only been described to me. In your books.
86050,L457107,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Surely you've seen a man naked.
86051,L457106,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one."
86052,L457105,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,They've taken your clothes?
86053,L456950,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,I don't believe it!
86054,L456949,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe..."
86055,L456946,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door..."
86056,L456945,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,What have they done to you now?
86057,L456541,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,What's that then?
86058,L456540,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
86059,L456539,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"You demand a lot from your readers, you do."
86060,L456538,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
86061,L456537,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"It's a long story, this one."
86062,L456533,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"Oh, you. You talk same as you write."
86063,L456532,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am..."
86064,L456531,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,"Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?"
86065,L456530,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,A kiss for each page.
86066,L456528,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Fiendishly so.
86067,L456527,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Is it terribly erotic?
86068,L456526,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Most assuredly.
86069,L456525,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Is it awfully violent?
86070,L456524,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane."
86071,L456523,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
86072,L456522,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
86073,L456521,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator..."
86074,L456520,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,There's something else I want from you.
86075,L456519,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"If only these coins purchased your other talents, too."
86076,L456518,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
86077,L456517,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
86078,L456515,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
86079,L456514,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake."
86080,L456513,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
86081,L456512,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Did I frighten you?
86082,L456509,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
86083,L456508,u2538,m164,MADELEINE,Don't start --
86084,L456507,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,I'm hungry for a proper visit.
86085,L457078,u2543,m164,SIMONE,No. But tell him I would.
86086,L457077,u2539,m164,MONSIEUR PROUIX,"You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?"
86087,L457076,u2543,m164,SIMONE,"Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart."
86088,L457075,u2539,m164,MONSIEUR PROUIX,"""By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."""
86089,L457074,u2543,m164,SIMONE,"Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers."
86090,L457073,u2539,m164,MONSIEUR PROUIX,"""...your wife."""
86091,L457035,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own."
86092,L457034,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
86093,L457033,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
86094,L457025,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --"
86095,L457024,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
86096,L457021,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use."
86097,L457020,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --"
86098,L457019,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,This is neither the time nor the place --
86099,L457018,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?"
86100,L457017,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Good God, Marquise --"
86101,L456875,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
86102,L456874,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Of course.
86103,L456873,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
86104,L456872,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,And I in yours.
86105,L456871,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,I am eternally in your debt.
86106,L456868,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride."
86107,L456867,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Don't toy with me, Doctor."
86108,L456865,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
86109,L456864,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,-- words alone are insufficient.
86110,L456863,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Oh, but I am!"
86111,L456862,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
86112,L456861,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation."
86113,L456860,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,What thought is that?
86114,L456859,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"What a beautiful thought, Marquise."
86115,L456858,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"It's tainted money, Doctor."
86116,L456857,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?"
86117,L456856,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,I am not a wealthy woman.
86118,L456855,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
86119,L456854,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
86120,L456853,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should."
86121,L456852,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton..."
86122,L456848,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms."
86123,L456847,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
86124,L456844,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?"
86125,L456843,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case."
86126,L456842,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,I pray you: be succinct.
86127,L456841,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane."
86128,L456840,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
86129,L456839,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy."
86130,L456838,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,"It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --"
86131,L456829,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?"
86132,L456828,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
86133,L456827,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
86134,L456826,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!"
86135,L456825,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?"
86136,L456824,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?"
86137,L456821,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt."
86138,L456820,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"They've put you up to this, haven't they?"
86139,L456819,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
86140,L456818,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,You've come to lecture me?
86141,L456817,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself."
86142,L456816,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?"
86143,L456815,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"How was I to know, my darling?"
86144,L456813,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"Forgive me, I beg you --"
86145,L456812,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,"For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?"
86146,L456811,u2541,m164,RENEE PELAGIE,"....shame on you, truly..."
86147,L456810,u2544,m164,THE MARQUIS,Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
86148,L456884,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,You prefer a book to your husband's company?
86149,L456883,u2543,m164,SIMONE,"I'd rather read, thank-you."
86150,L456882,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
86151,L456881,u2543,m164,SIMONE,Very much.
86152,L456880,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Doesn't that please you?
86153,L456743,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Do as I say.
86154,L456742,u2543,m164,SIMONE,But it's just begun --
86155,L456741,u2542,m164,ROYER-COLLARD,Leave at once --
86156,L469160,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money."
86157,L469159,u2557,m165,WELLES,That poor woman.
86158,L469154,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
86159,L469153,u2557,m165,WELLES,"Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--"
86160,L469152,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere."
86161,L469151,u2557,m165,WELLES,"Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born."
86162,L469150,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Of being found out. Of not being a genius
86163,L469147,u2557,m165,WELLES,Am I?
86164,L469146,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,You're just scared.
86165,L469145,u2557,m165,WELLES,I wonder sometimes.
86166,L469144,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great."
86167,L469143,u2557,m165,WELLES,Not you too
86168,L469142,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,So you ever gonna do a picture?
86169,L469091,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Last week would this be?
86170,L469090,u2557,m165,WELLES,"No, when I was but a tender lad--"
86171,L469089,u2557,m165,WELLES,Ever met Walter Winchell?
86172,L469654,u2551,m165,MARION,"But I am That's the killer, honey."
86173,L469653,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--"
86174,L469652,u2551,m165,MARION,"The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--"
86175,L469651,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Uh-huh
86176,L469650,u2551,m165,MARION,You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
86177,L469649,u2551,m165,MARION,Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
86178,L469648,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
86179,L469647,u2551,m165,MARION,"Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special."
86180,L469646,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Sure
86181,L469645,u2551,m165,MARION,"I did my best but, well, you know me"
86182,L469643,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,And he did.
86183,L469642,u2551,m165,MARION,When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
86184,L469131,u2551,m165,MARION,He needs me here.
86185,L469130,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"Sure you can, just--"
86186,L469129,u2551,m165,MARION,I can't
86187,L469128,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--"
86188,L469127,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Mm.
86189,L469126,u2551,m165,MARION,And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
86190,L469125,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down."
86191,L469124,u2551,m165,MARION,Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
86192,L469123,u2551,m165,MARION,"It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?"
86193,L469122,u2551,m165,MARION,With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
86194,L469121,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
86195,L469120,u2551,m165,MARION,"That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me."
86196,L469119,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,"You need to get outta here, Rapunzel"
86197,L469118,u2551,m165,MARION,"God, these parties are the worst"
86198,L469072,u2546,m165,CAROLE LOMBARD,Houdini mice.
86199,L469071,u2551,m165,MARION,And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
86200,L469815,u2547,m165,HEARST,"So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?"
86201,L469814,u2557,m165,WELLES,"Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master."
86202,L469813,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property."
86203,L469812,u2557,m165,WELLES,Do you?
86204,L469811,u2547,m165,HEARST,I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
86205,L469107,u2557,m165,WELLES,I'll remember that.
86206,L469106,u2547,m165,HEARST,In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
86207,L469105,u2557,m165,WELLES,So I've been told.
86208,L469104,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business."
86209,L469101,u2557,m165,WELLES,To make pictures.
86210,L469100,u2547,m165,HEARST,I see. And you are in California for what reason?
86211,L469099,u2557,m165,WELLES,And director.
86212,L469098,u2547,m165,HEARST,The actor
86213,L469097,u2557,m165,WELLES,My name is Orson Welles
86214,L469096,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Who are you, sir?"
86215,L469495,u2552,m165,MAYER,Yeah
86216,L469494,u2547,m165,HEARST,"See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?"
86217,L469492,u2552,m165,MAYER,Bel Air is restricted.
86218,L469491,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Why is that, Louis?"
86219,L469490,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Oh, why is that?"
86220,L469489,u2552,m165,MAYER,You know that can't happen.
86221,L469488,u2547,m165,HEARST,And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
86222,L469485,u2552,m165,MAYER,Yeah
86223,L469484,u2547,m165,HEARST,Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
86224,L469483,u2552,m165,MAYER,Uh-hub.
86225,L469482,u2547,m165,HEARST,Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
86226,L469481,u2552,m165,MAYER,Over at RKO?
86227,L469480,u2547,m165,HEARST,Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
86228,L469478,u2547,m165,HEARST,Hope you don't mind my popping in--
86229,L469477,u2552,m165,MAYER,Randolph!
86230,L469476,u2547,m165,HEARST,Louis
86231,L469641,u2547,m165,HEARST,"There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not."
86232,L469640,u2551,m165,MARION,I don't want you to--
86233,L469639,u2547,m165,HEARST,castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
86234,L469638,u2547,m165,HEARST,"No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous"
86235,L469637,u2551,m165,MARION,I just want to understand--
86236,L469636,u2547,m165,HEARST,I will not have this in my home.
86237,L469635,u2551,m165,MARION,"Fuck you, Mr. Kane."
86238,L469634,u2547,m165,HEARST,You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
86239,L469633,u2551,m165,MARION,Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
86240,L469632,u2547,m165,HEARST,You are repellant when you drink.
86241,L469631,u2551,m165,MARION,You will not walk out on me
86242,L469630,u2547,m165,HEARST,That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
86243,L469629,u2551,m165,MARION,But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
86244,L469628,u2547,m165,HEARST,Not for me.
86245,L469627,u2551,m165,MARION,There's a different between want and
86246,L469626,u2547,m165,HEARST,I wanted it
86247,L469625,u2551,m165,MARION,Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
86248,L469624,u2547,m165,HEARST,You needn't use that language with me
86249,L469623,u2551,m165,MARION,I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
86250,L469622,u2547,m165,HEARST,It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
86251,L469621,u2551,m165,MARION,That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
86252,L469620,u2551,m165,MARION,You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
86253,L469619,u2547,m165,HEARST,"You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--"
86254,L469618,u2551,m165,MARION,"You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--"
86255,L469617,u2547,m165,HEARST,There is nothing to discuss-
86256,L469616,u2551,m165,MARION,You gotta wake up now. Pops.
86257,L469615,u2547,m165,HEARST,"We are in no ""pickle"" -- as you would euphemistically have it."
86258,L469614,u2551,m165,MARION,I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
86259,L469613,u2547,m165,HEARST,I will not defend my life to you--
86260,L469612,u2551,m165,MARION,A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
86261,L469611,u2547,m165,HEARST,There's nothing to explain
86262,L469610,u2551,m165,MARION,Then you explain it to me?!
86263,L469570,u2551,m165,MARION,I am not that woman.
86264,L469569,u2547,m165,HEARST,This picture--
86265,L469568,u2551,m165,MARION,Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
86266,L469567,u2547,m165,HEARST,Marion--
86267,L469566,u2551,m165,MARION,"Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore."
86268,L469565,u2551,m165,MARION,"Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh"
86269,L469522,u2547,m165,HEARST,One . . . buys things.
86270,L469521,u2551,m165,MARION,How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
86271,L469520,u2547,m165,HEARST,Yes.
86272,L469519,u2551,m165,MARION,We're 125 million dollars in debt?
86273,L469517,u2551,m165,MARION,How much?
86274,L469516,u2547,m165,HEARST,It's not really--
86275,L469515,u2551,m165,MARION,How much?
86276,L469514,u2547,m165,HEARST,The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
86277,L469513,u2551,m165,MARION,Pops
86278,L469512,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Nothing for you to worry about, darling"
86279,L469511,u2551,m165,MARION,How bad is it?
86280,L469507,u2551,m165,MARION,Don't
86281,L469506,u2547,m165,HEARST,He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
86282,L469505,u2551,m165,MARION,"You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all."
86283,L469504,u2547,m165,HEARST,The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
86284,L469298,u2551,m165,MARION,Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
86285,L469297,u2547,m165,HEARST,"She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently."
86286,L469296,u2551,m165,MARION,There. That's right.
86287,L469294,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Darling, I talked to Millicent."
86288,L469293,u2551,m165,MARION,This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
86289,L469158,u2551,m165,MARION,"There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!"
86290,L469157,u2547,m165,HEARST,There's no call for that language-
86291,L469156,u2551,m165,MARION,Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
86292,L469468,u2547,m165,HEARST,Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
86293,L469467,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,I want blood
86294,L469466,u2547,m165,HEARST,And how do you feel when you are lied to?
86295,L469465,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
86296,L469464,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,He lied to me
86297,L469463,u2547,m165,HEARST,Please be quiet.
86298,L469462,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,"Sir, I-"
86299,L469461,u2547,m165,HEARST,"I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me."
86300,L469460,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,Sir?
86301,L469459,u2547,m165,HEARST,Why did we not know about this sooner?
86302,L469458,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,Sir?
86303,L469457,u2547,m165,HEARST,"Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you."
86304,L469456,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,"Thank you, sir. She begins to leave"
86305,L469455,u2547,m165,HEARST,Thank you for your time
86306,L469453,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,The drinking.
86307,L469452,u2547,m165,HEARST,Yes?
86308,L469451,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,"The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And..."
86309,L469450,u2547,m165,HEARST,How so?
86310,L469449,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
86311,L469413,u2557,m165,WELLES,"""A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."""

86335,L469501,u2549,m165,LOUELLA,And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.

86345,L469438,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--

86373,L469548,u2550,m165,MANK,"Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--"

86414,L469231,u2550,m165,MANK,And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
86415,L469230,u2557,m165,WELLES,"The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them."
86416,L469229,u2550,m165,MANK,And what does he see?
86417,L469228,u2557,m165,WELLES,Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.

86452,L469183,u2550,m165,MANK,"You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell."
86453,L469182,u2557,m165,WELLES,We're doing Hearst.
86454,L469181,u2550,m165,MANK,"Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved."

86577,L469783,u2557,m165,WELLES,I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
86578,L469782,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--

86585,L469745,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
86586,L469684,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
86587,L469683,u2557,m165,WELLES,That soulless monster gets no tears from me.

86597,L469673,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
86598,L469672,u2557,m165,WELLES,Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
86599,L469671,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture

86603,L469472,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?

86611,L469311,u2557,m165,WELLES,Please don't ask me to do this.
86612,L469310,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.

86614,L469308,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
86615,L469307,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,"Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?"
86616,L469306,u2557,m165,WELLES,"I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!"
86617,L469305,u2554,m165,SCHAEFER,"Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--"
86618,L469304,u2557,m165,WELLES,"A ""Z"" and a ""K"" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a ""Z"" and a ""P"" and that worked--"

86622,L469300,u2557,m165,WELLES,"It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--"

86653,L458745,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Tommy, thanks for coming over."
86654,L458744,u2559,m166,COMO,Hey champ!
86655,L458683,u2559,m166,COMO,"Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!"
86656,L458682,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own."
86657,L458681,u2559,m166,COMO,"He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him."
86658,L458680,u2564,m166,JOEY,How can he embarrass you?
86659,L458679,u2559,m166,COMO,"Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment."
86660,L458678,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that."
86661,L458677,u2559,m166,COMO,"What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?"
86662,L458676,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy."
86663,L458675,u2559,m166,COMO,"Aside from everything else, your family all right?"
86664,L458673,u2559,m166,COMO,"All right, you guys, shake hands."
86665,L458672,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Yeah, I understand, Tommy."
86666,L458671,u2559,m166,COMO,"All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?"
86667,L458710,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody."
86668,L458709,u2560,m166,EAGAN,What?
86669,L458708,u2563,m166,JAKE,I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
86670,L458707,u2560,m166,EAGAN,"I want to believe you, LaMotta."
86671,L458706,u2563,m166,JAKE,Believe what you want.
86672,L458705,u2560,m166,EAGAN,Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
86673,L458704,u2563,m166,JAKE,I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
86674,L458703,u2560,m166,EAGAN,You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
86675,L458702,u2563,m166,JAKE,What who's been sayin'?
86676,L458699,u2560,m166,EAGAN,I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
86677,L458698,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What's up, Colonel?"
86678,L458447,u2561,m166,IRMA,None of your fuckin' business.
86679,L458446,u2563,m166,JAKE,And where you goin'?
86680,L458445,u2561,m166,IRMA,"You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out."
86681,L458444,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business."
86682,L458443,u2561,m166,IRMA,Where you going at this hour?
86683,L458361,u2563,m166,JAKE,"No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch."
86684,L458360,u2561,m166,IRMA,Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
86685,L458359,u2561,m166,IRMA,Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
86686,L458358,u2563,m166,JAKE,It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
86687,L458357,u2561,m166,IRMA,It's not done.
86688,L458356,u2563,m166,JAKE,This looks done.
86689,L458948,u2563,m166,JAKE,Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
86690,L458947,u2562,m166,J.R.,"Where's your wife, Jake?"
86691,L458946,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Yeah, I really cleaned up on him."
86692,L458945,u2562,m166,J.R.,"I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great."
86693,L458944,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You're a good sport, lady."
86694,L458942,u2562,m166,J.R.,"You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife."
86695,L458941,u2563,m166,JAKE,"J.R., glad you could make it."
86696,L458872,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Stop it. What're you, crazy?"
86697,L458871,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?"
86698,L458840,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy."
86699,L458839,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?"
86700,L458838,u2564,m166,JOEY,Whatsa matter with you?
86701,L458837,u2563,m166,JAKE,Did you ever fuck my wife?
86702,L458836,u2564,m166,JOEY,Whadda ya mean?
86703,L458835,u2563,m166,JAKE,I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
86704,L458834,u2564,m166,JOEY,What?
86705,L458833,u2563,m166,JAKE,Did you ever fuck my wife?
86706,L458832,u2564,m166,JOEY,"You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month."
86707,L458831,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody."
86708,L458830,u2564,m166,JOEY,So what?
86709,L458829,u2563,m166,JAKE,"But you said ""you."""
86710,L458828,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head."
86711,L458827,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What do you mean, ""you""?"
86712,L458826,u2564,m166,JOEY,What?
86713,L458825,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What do you mean, ""you""?"
86714,L458824,u2564,m166,JOEY,"So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about."
86715,L458823,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody..."
86716,L458822,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin"" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now."
86717,L458821,u2563,m166,JAKE,"When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'."
86718,L458820,u2564,m166,JOEY,"What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?"
86719,L458819,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth."
86720,L458818,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like."
86721,L458817,u2563,m166,JAKE,Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
86722,L458816,u2564,m166,JOEY,I did keep an eye...
86723,L458815,u2563,m166,JAKE,You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
86724,L458814,u2564,m166,JOEY,What?
86725,L458813,u2563,m166,JAKE,Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
86726,L458812,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Whatever you touched, that's good now."
86727,L458810,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Well, I heard some things."
86728,L458809,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it."
86729,L458808,u2563,m166,JAKE,Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
86730,L458807,u2564,m166,JOEY,"No, I just told you what happened."
86731,L458806,u2563,m166,JAKE,Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
86732,L458805,u2564,m166,JOEY,It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
86733,L458804,u2563,m166,JAKE,Why didn't you tell me about it?
86734,L458803,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about."
86735,L458802,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You know, when you gave him a beatin'."
86736,L458801,u2564,m166,JOEY,When?
86737,L458800,u2563,m166,JAKE,Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
86738,L458798,u2564,m166,JOEY,I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
86739,L458797,u2563,m166,JAKE,How's that?
86740,L458796,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Well, that's what I mean."
86741,L458795,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth."
86742,L458794,u2563,m166,JAKE,Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
86743,L458793,u2564,m166,JOEY,What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
86744,L458790,u2563,m166,JAKE,Where you been?
86745,L458789,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Screw you, Jack."
86746,L458738,u2563,m166,JAKE,What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
86747,L458737,u2564,m166,JOEY,So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
86748,L458736,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in."
86749,L458735,u2564,m166,JOEY,I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
86750,L458731,u2564,m166,JOEY,We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
86751,L458730,u2563,m166,JAKE,Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
86752,L458729,u2564,m166,JOEY,"All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait."
86753,L458728,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Yeah, except fall down. That's right."
86754,L458727,u2564,m166,JOEY,Except fall down like a normal person.
86755,L458726,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything."
86756,L458725,u2564,m166,JOEY,See? That's all there was to it.
86757,L458724,u2564,m166,JOEY,"G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy."
86758,L458723,u2563,m166,JAKE,"C'mon, Joey."
86759,L458722,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Stick out your hands, Jake."
86760,L458695,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Yeah, I know."
86761,L458694,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is..."
86762,L458693,u2563,m166,JAKE,What did Tommy say?
86763,L458692,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Sure, I'll keep an eye on her."
86764,L458691,u2563,m166,JAKE,I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
86765,L458690,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you."
86766,L458689,u2563,m166,JAKE,"When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth."
86767,L458688,u2564,m166,JOEY,Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
86768,L458687,u2563,m166,JAKE,What do you mean?
86769,L458686,u2564,m166,JOEY,Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
86770,L458685,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her..."
86771,L458684,u2564,m166,JOEY,Whatcha doin'?
86772,L458587,u2563,m166,JAKE,Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
86773,L458586,u2564,m166,JOEY,Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
86774,L458583,u2564,m166,JOEY,"C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you."
86775,L458582,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her."
86776,L458581,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Nah, she would never..."
86777,L458556,u2564,m166,JOEY,"This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?"
86778,L458555,u2563,m166,JAKE,Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
86779,L458554,u2564,m166,JOEY,You want the title shot or not?
86780,L458553,u2563,m166,JAKE,Say what you're gonna say.
86781,L458552,u2564,m166,JOEY,You want the title shot?
86782,L458551,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!"
86783,L458550,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?"
86784,L458549,u2563,m166,JAKE,I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
86785,L458548,u2563,m166,JAKE,"No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go."
86786,L458547,u2564,m166,JOEY,You want us to wait for you?
86787,L458543,u2563,m166,JAKE,I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
86788,L458542,u2564,m166,JOEY,You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
86789,L458541,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand."
86790,L458540,u2564,m166,JOEY,"They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why."
86791,L458520,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title."
86792,L458519,u2564,m166,JOEY,He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
86793,L458462,u2564,m166,JOEY,Give me a chance. Let me look.
86794,L458461,u2563,m166,JAKE,Do you see her yet?
86795,L458454,u2563,m166,JAKE,How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
86796,L458453,u2564,m166,JOEY,"No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take."
86797,L458452,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife."
86798,L458442,u2564,m166,JOEY,"C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight."
86799,L458441,u2563,m166,JAKE,I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
86800,L458440,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything."
86801,L458439,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now."
86802,L458438,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?"
86803,L458437,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You know, like bang her or anything?"
86804,L458436,u2564,m166,JOEY,With her? How?
86805,L458435,u2563,m166,JAKE,You wasn't with her?
86806,L458434,u2564,m166,JOEY,Huh?
86807,L458433,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You wasn't with her, were you?"
86808,L458432,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you."
86809,L458431,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Yeah, she's nice."
86810,L458430,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him."
86811,L458429,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one..."
86812,L458428,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old."
86813,L458427,u2563,m166,JAKE,She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
86814,L458426,u2564,m166,JOEY,How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
86815,L458425,u2563,m166,JAKE,'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
86816,L458424,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there."
86817,L458423,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right..."
86818,L458422,u2564,m166,JOEY,"No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that."
86819,L458421,u2563,m166,JAKE,How do you know? You know her that good?
86820,L458420,u2564,m166,JOEY,"You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass."
86821,L458419,u2563,m166,JAKE,Go 'head.
86822,L458418,u2564,m166,JOEY,Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
86823,L458417,u2563,m166,JAKE,Yeah --
86824,L458416,u2564,m166,JOEY,"No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?"
86825,L458415,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?"
86826,L458414,u2564,m166,JOEY,Whadda you care?
86827,L458413,u2563,m166,JAKE,Who's that?
86828,L458409,u2564,m166,JOEY,I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
86829,L458408,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again."
86830,L458407,u2564,m166,JOEY,What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
86831,L458406,u2563,m166,JAKE,"And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot."
86832,L458403,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood."
86833,L458402,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I..."
86834,L458401,u2563,m166,JAKE,Answer me when I talk to you.
86835,L458397,u2563,m166,JAKE,"See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody."
86836,L458396,u2564,m166,JOEY,What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
86837,L458395,u2563,m166,JAKE,Go ahead.
86838,L458394,u2564,m166,JOEY,Jack! Enough!
86839,L458393,u2563,m166,JAKE,Harder.  Take the towel off.
86840,L458389,u2563,m166,JAKE,Here's your glove.
86841,L458388,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Jack, I got no gloves."
86842,L458387,u2563,m166,JAKE,Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
86843,L458386,u2564,m166,JOEY,"C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks."
86844,L458385,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You heard me, I said hit me."
86845,L458384,u2564,m166,JOEY,You want me to do what?
86846,L458383,u2563,m166,JAKE,Hit me in the face.
86847,L458382,u2564,m166,JOEY,Sure. What is it?
86848,L458381,u2563,m166,JAKE,Yeah. Do me a favor.
86849,L458380,u2564,m166,JOEY,You know?
86850,L458379,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know..."
86851,L458378,u2564,m166,JOEY,That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
86852,L458376,u2564,m166,JOEY,What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
86853,L458375,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter."
86854,L458374,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?"
86855,L458373,u2563,m166,JAKE,Nothing...
86856,L458372,u2564,m166,JOEY,What's wrong?
86857,L458937,u2565,m166,REPORTER,"What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?"
86858,L458936,u2563,m166,JAKE,Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
86859,L458935,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie."
86860,L458934,u2565,m166,REPORTER,You sound bitter.
86861,L458933,u2563,m166,JAKE,"It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight."
86862,L458932,u2565,m166,REPORTER,Does that mean...
86863,L458931,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight."
86864,L458522,u2563,m166,JAKE,I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
86865,L458521,u2565,m166,REPORTER,You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
86866,L458518,u2563,m166,JAKE,You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
86867,L458517,u2565,m166,REPORTER,"Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate."
86868,L458516,u2563,m166,JAKE,Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
86869,L458513,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about."
86870,L458512,u2565,m166,REPORTER,"Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?"
86871,L458511,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad."
86872,L458925,u2568,m166,TONY,"Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points."
86873,L458924,u2563,m166,JAKE,"He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down."
86874,L458893,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title."
86875,L458892,u2568,m166,TONY,"I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break."
86876,L458891,u2563,m166,JAKE,Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
86877,L458890,u2568,m166,TONY,"Three more, I figure."
86878,L458889,u2563,m166,JAKE,How many pounds I gotta lose?
86879,L458888,u2568,m166,TONY,Yeah. At night.
86880,L458887,u2563,m166,JAKE,At night?
86881,L458886,u2568,m166,TONY,Nine o'clock.
86882,L458885,u2563,m166,JAKE,What time is it?
86883,L458884,u2568,m166,TONY,"It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out."
86884,L458717,u2563,m166,JAKE,Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
86885,L458716,u2568,m166,TONY,"Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!"
86886,L458996,u2563,m166,JAKE,What friends?
86887,L458995,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Can't you get the money from your friends?
86888,L458994,u2563,m166,JAKE,Don't make no difference no more.
86889,L458993,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!"
86890,L458992,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? ""LaMotta on Vice Rap."" Everybody likes a shot at the Champ."
86891,L458991,u2569,m166,VICKIE,But they don't have a case against you.
86892,L458990,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped."
86893,L458989,u2569,m166,VICKIE,What are you doing?
86894,L458988,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"All right, just don't make any noise."
86895,L458987,u2563,m166,JAKE,I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
86896,L458986,u2569,m166,VICKIE,The kids are sleeping.
86897,L458984,u2563,m166,JAKE,No. Open the door.
86898,L458983,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Are you drunk?
86899,L458982,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Vickie, open up. I need to come in."
86900,L458965,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
86901,L458964,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Aw, c'mon, Vick --"
86902,L458963,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids."
86903,L458962,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Aw, c'mon. Don't say that."
86904,L458961,u2569,m166,VICKIE,No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
86905,L458960,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Open the door, Vickie."
86906,L458959,u2569,m166,VICKIE,No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
86907,L458958,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Sure, what else is new?"
86908,L458957,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I'm leaving you Jake.
86909,L458956,u2563,m166,JAKE,I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
86910,L458912,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number."
86911,L458911,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
86912,L458910,u2563,m166,JAKE,I dunno.
86913,L458909,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Why don't you just call him?
86914,L458908,u2563,m166,JAKE,I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
86915,L458904,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I don't know.
86916,L458903,u2563,m166,JAKE,Then what?
86917,L458902,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"No, not that."
86918,L458901,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, ""Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?"" Is that what I say?"
86919,L458900,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Why don't you just call him up?
86920,L458899,u2563,m166,JAKE,OK. Talk.
86921,L458898,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
86922,L458897,u2563,m166,JAKE,What?
86923,L458896,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Jake --
86924,L458895,u2563,m166,JAKE,"I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out."
86925,L458894,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest."
86926,L458883,u2563,m166,JAKE,Yeah --
86927,L458882,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?"
86928,L458878,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital."
86929,L458877,u2563,m166,JAKE,You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
86930,L458876,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal."
86931,L458875,u2563,m166,JAKE,Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
86932,L458874,u2569,m166,VICKIE,You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
86933,L458868,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Yeah, I sucked his cock."
86934,L458867,u2563,m166,JAKE,You did?
86935,L458866,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
86936,L458863,u2563,m166,JAKE,You're a fuckin' liar.
86937,L458862,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it."
86938,L458861,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?"
86939,L458860,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong."
86940,L458859,u2563,m166,JAKE,"With Salvy, eh?"
86941,L458858,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
86942,L458857,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it."
86943,L458856,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Jake, no --"
86944,L458855,u2563,m166,JAKE,What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
86945,L458854,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I am answering...
86946,L458853,u2563,m166,JAKE,Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
86947,L458852,u2569,m166,VICKIE,What're you talking about?
86948,L458851,u2563,m166,JAKE,Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
86949,L458850,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?"
86950,L458849,u2563,m166,JAKE,What was it about?
86951,L458848,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"""Father of the Bride."""
86952,L458847,u2563,m166,JAKE,What'd you see?
86953,L458846,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I went to the movies.
86954,L458845,u2563,m166,JAKE,What'd you see?
86955,L458844,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I got bored so I went to the movies.
86956,L458843,u2563,m166,JAKE,I called. You weren't there.
86957,L458842,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I took the kids to my sister's.
86958,L458841,u2563,m166,JAKE,Where you been all day?
86959,L458792,u2563,m166,JAKE,What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
86960,L458791,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I went out.
86961,L458788,u2563,m166,JAKE,Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
86962,L458787,u2569,m166,VICKIE,What's the matter with you?
86963,L458763,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Jake...
86964,L458762,u2563,m166,JAKE,Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
86965,L458761,u2569,m166,VICKIE,But Jake... I didn't say anything...
86966,L458759,u2569,m166,VICKIE,You're hurting my arm.
86967,L458758,u2563,m166,JAKE,You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
86968,L458757,u2569,m166,VICKIE,All I did...
86969,L458756,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do."
86970,L458755,u2569,m166,VICKIE,What did I do?
86971,L458754,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that."
86972,L458617,u2563,m166,JAKE,You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
86973,L458616,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Positive.
86974,L458615,u2563,m166,JAKE,You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
86975,L458614,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I never noticed his face.
86976,L458613,u2563,m166,JAKE,That he's got a pretty face.
86977,L458612,u2569,m166,VICKIE,What did I say?
86978,L458611,u2563,m166,JAKE,Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
86979,L458610,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Nobody. I love you, remember?"
86980,L458609,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?"
86981,L458608,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Yeah, what?"
86982,L458607,u2563,m166,JAKE,Huh?
86983,L458606,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Yeah.
86984,L458605,u2563,m166,JAKE,You asleep?
86985,L458604,u2569,m166,VICKIE,What?
86986,L458603,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?"
86987,L458580,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?"
86988,L458579,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Jake, c'mon now. Don't start."
86989,L458578,u2563,m166,JAKE,"In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?"
86990,L458577,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"No, I'm not."
86991,L458576,u2563,m166,JAKE,You're not interested in him?
86992,L458575,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I'm not interested in him.
86993,L458574,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Don't tell me ""No."" I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?"
86994,L458573,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"No, I'm not. I'm looking at you."
86995,L458572,u2563,m166,JAKE,What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
86996,L458564,u2563,m166,JAKE,Who asked you?
86997,L458563,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I was just...
86998,L458562,u2563,m166,JAKE,Who asked you?
86999,L458561,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"But, Jake, I was just..."
87000,L458560,u2563,m166,JAKE,Who asked you?
87001,L458559,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should..."
87002,L458558,u2563,m166,JAKE,"What do you mean, ""good looking?"""
87003,L458557,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking..."
87004,L458538,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Oh, Jake."
87005,L458537,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Now, touch me...  ...here."
87006,L458536,u2563,m166,JAKE,Now take your panties off.
87007,L458535,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I like the gym smell.
87008,L458534,u2563,m166,JAKE,Go 'head. Do it.
87009,L458533,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited."
87010,L458532,u2563,m166,JAKE,Now take the rest off.
87011,L458531,u2563,m166,JAKE,Do what I say.
87012,L458530,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Jake...
87013,L458529,u2563,m166,JAKE,Take off my pants.
87014,L458528,u2563,m166,JAKE,Come here.
87015,L458527,u2569,m166,VICKIE,You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
87016,L458526,u2563,m166,JAKE,"If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here."
87017,L458525,u2569,m166,VICKIE,You said never to touch you before a fight.
87018,L458524,u2563,m166,JAKE,Come over here.
87019,L458523,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Are you sure we should be doing this?
87020,L458505,u2563,m166,JAKE,It's OK.
87021,L458504,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Jake...
87022,L458503,u2563,m166,JAKE,That's all right. He don't mind.
87023,L458502,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Jake, this is your father's bedroom."
87024,L458492,u2569,m166,VICKIE,What does that mean?
87025,L458491,u2563,m166,JAKE,No.
87026,L458490,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Can you see it?
87027,L458488,u2563,m166,JAKE,Can you see it?
87028,L458487,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I can't find my ball.
87029,L458486,u2563,m166,JAKE,Just give it a nice little tap.
87030,L458485,u2569,m166,VICKIE,Should I hit it?
87031,L458484,u2563,m166,JAKE,Just keep your eye on the ball.
87032,L458483,u2569,m166,VICKIE,It feels real good.
87033,L458482,u2563,m166,JAKE,That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
87034,L458481,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you."
87035,L458480,u2569,m166,VICKIE,You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
87036,L458477,u2563,m166,JAKE,Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
87037,L458476,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
87038,L458475,u2563,m166,JAKE,I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
87039,L458474,u2569,m166,VICKIE,You don't talk very much.
87040,L458471,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?"
87041,L458470,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
87042,L458469,u2563,m166,JAKE,"You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?"
87043,L458468,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I just wanted to say hello.
87044,L458467,u2563,m166,JAKE,Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
87045,L458602,u2563,m166,JAKE,I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
87046,L458601,u2567,m166,TOMMY,"All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?"
87047,L458600,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Yeah, the weight's Ok."
87048,L458599,u2567,m166,TOMMY,How's the weight? Ok?
87049,L458597,u2567,m166,TOMMY,"This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid."
87050,L458596,u2563,m166,JAKE,He should.
87051,L458595,u2567,m166,TOMMY,"Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?"
87052,L458594,u2563,m166,JAKE,Never felt better.
87053,L458593,u2567,m166,TOMMY,How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
87054,L458592,u2563,m166,JAKE,"C'mon, Tommy --"
87055,L458591,u2567,m166,TOMMY,"Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them ""moulan yans"" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you."
87056,L458590,u2567,m166,TOMMY,"Jake, sit down for a minute."
87057,L458589,u2563,m166,JAKE,"Hi, Tommy. How are you?"
87058,L458667,u2564,m166,JOEY,I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
87059,L458666,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?"
87060,L458662,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand."
87061,L458661,u2564,m166,JOEY,"What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife."
87062,L458660,u2566,m166,SALVY,Excuse me for living.
87063,L458659,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law."
87064,L458658,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?"
87065,L458657,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I said, let's go."
87066,L458368,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Right, the gym."
87067,L458367,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget."
87068,L458366,u2564,m166,JOEY,"All right, I'll try. See you later."
87069,L458365,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!"
87070,L458364,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that."
87071,L458363,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody."
87072,L458350,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Get lost.  Hey kids, ""A cop is a rat."" Remember that, ""A rat."""
87073,L458349,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Hey, leave the kids alone."
87074,L458348,u2566,m166,SALVY,He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
87075,L458347,u2564,m166,JOEY,"What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother."
87076,L458346,u2566,m166,SALVY,"Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother."
87077,L458345,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash."
87078,L458655,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong."
87079,L458654,u2564,m166,JOEY,And you're drinking with them right now.
87080,L458653,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him."
87081,L458652,u2564,m166,JOEY,"Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long."
87082,L458651,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared."
87083,L458650,u2564,m166,JOEY,"I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want."
87084,L458649,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time."
87085,L458648,u2564,m166,JOEY,It don't look right.
87086,L458647,u2569,m166,VICKIE,I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
87087,L458646,u2564,m166,JOEY,"No, you're his wife."
87088,L458645,u2569,m166,VICKIE,"What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?"
87089,L458644,u2564,m166,JOEY,What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
87090,L461809,u2570,m167,BABY SITTER,Goodnight.
87091,L461808,u2574,m167,JEFF,He has it. Thank you.
87092,L461807,u2570,m167,BABY SITTER,"Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?"
87093,L461806,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him."
87094,L461805,u2570,m167,BABY SITTER,I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
87095,L461804,u2574,m167,JEFF,Oh. When are they expected home?
87096,L461803,u2570,m167,BABY SITTER,This is the baby sitter.
87097,L461802,u2574,m167,JEFF,"This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?"
87098,L461801,u2570,m167,BABY SITTER,This is Doyle's house.
87099,L461063,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Don't worry -- it comes off today.
87100,L461062,u2571,m167,BRYCE,But his leg!
87101,L461061,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Name me a better photographer.
87102,L461060,u2571,m167,BRYCE,Jefferies?
87103,L461059,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,"Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies."
87104,L461058,u2571,m167,BRYCE,I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
87105,L461057,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
87106,L461056,u2571,m167,BRYCE,"From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there."
87107,L461055,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
87108,L461656,u2572,m167,DOYLE,That's what they call a family problem.
87109,L461655,u2575,m167,LISA,I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
87110,L461651,u2575,m167,LISA,Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
87111,L461650,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
87112,L461648,u2572,m167,DOYLE,When the lock is broken -- yes.
87113,L461647,u2575,m167,LISA,"Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope."
87114,L461634,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
87115,L461633,u2575,m167,LISA,Like disposing of their wives?
87116,L461623,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Namely?
87117,L461622,u2575,m167,LISA,"It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion."
87118,L461872,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long."
87119,L461871,u2574,m167,JEFF,Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
87120,L461870,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff."
87121,L461869,u2574,m167,JEFF,Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
87122,L461868,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Where'd they take Lisa?
87123,L461867,u2574,m167,JEFF,"In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?"
87124,L461866,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"You think perhaps it was ""old hambone?"""
87125,L461865,u2574,m167,JEFF,"I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!"
87126,L461864,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Like an old hambone?
87127,L461863,u2574,m167,JEFF,A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
87128,L461862,u2572,m167,DOYLE,A possibility.
87129,L461861,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it."
87130,L461860,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Like what?
87131,L461859,u2574,m167,JEFF,"I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it."
87132,L461858,u2572,m167,DOYLE,I told you that --
87133,L461857,u2574,m167,JEFF,"My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police."
87134,L461856,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Your Lisa?
87135,L461855,u2574,m167,JEFF,Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
87136,L461854,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --"
87137,L461853,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Tom, I've got something real big for you."
87138,L461852,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"This is Doyle, Jeff."
87139,L461851,u2574,m167,JEFF,Jefferies.
87140,L461674,u2572,m167,DOYLE,The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
87141,L461673,u2574,m167,JEFF,"That depends on who ""they"" were."
87142,L461672,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
87143,L461661,u2574,m167,JEFF,All the things I hate.
87144,L461660,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --"
87145,L461640,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Your logic is backward.
87146,L461639,u2574,m167,JEFF,But I'm not a killer!
87147,L461638,u2572,m167,DOYLE,And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
87148,L461637,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well, in the garage, back home, we --"
87149,L461636,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Did you ever own a saw?
87150,L461625,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"You figured that out, huh?"
87151,L461624,u2574,m167,JEFF,That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
87152,L461621,u2572,m167,DOYLE,You sure it belongs to his wife?
87153,L461620,u2574,m167,JEFF,He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
87154,L461619,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Jewelry?
87155,L461608,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing."
87156,L461607,u2572,m167,DOYLE,You think he's getting out of here?
87157,L461606,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him."
87158,L461517,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Mrs. Thorwald.
87159,L461516,u2574,m167,JEFF,Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
87160,L461514,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Oh -- I almost forgot!
87161,L461513,u2574,m167,JEFF,Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
87162,L461511,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: ""Your request for transfer turned down --"""
87163,L461510,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Ever get an answer?
87164,L461509,u2574,m167,JEFF,"You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?"
87165,L461508,u2572,m167,DOYLE,How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
87166,L461507,u2572,m167,DOYLE,One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
87167,L461506,u2574,m167,JEFF,What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
87168,L461505,u2572,m167,DOYLE,A detective's nightmare.
87169,L461504,u2574,m167,JEFF,By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
87170,L461503,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"I can hear myself starting out. ""Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --""  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes."
87171,L461502,u2574,m167,JEFF,Give him evidence.
87172,L461501,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase ""search warrant"" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence."
87173,L461500,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear."
87174,L461499,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!"
87175,L461498,u2574,m167,JEFF,What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
87176,L461497,u2572,m167,DOYLE,I can't do it even if he's gone.
87177,L461496,u2574,m167,JEFF,"I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him."
87178,L461495,u2572,m167,DOYLE,I can't do that.
87179,L461494,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence."
87180,L461493,u2572,m167,DOYLE,If possible -- both.
87181,L461492,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?"
87182,L461491,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?"
87183,L461490,u2574,m167,JEFF,Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
87184,L461489,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Jeff -- huh?
87185,L461488,u2574,m167,JEFF,A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
87186,L461487,u2572,m167,DOYLE,The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
87187,L461486,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, ""Grand Central Or Bust!""?"
87188,L461485,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station."
87189,L461484,u2574,m167,JEFF,The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
87190,L461483,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Who left -- where?
87191,L461482,u2574,m167,JEFF,Who said they left then?
87192,L461479,u2574,m167,JEFF,Not yet.
87193,L461478,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Feel a little foolish?
87194,L461477,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
87195,L461476,u2574,m167,JEFF,I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
87196,L461475,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Six ayem.
87197,L461474,u2574,m167,JEFF,What time?
87198,L461473,u2572,m167,DOYLE,-- until yesterday morning.
87199,L461472,u2574,m167,JEFF,Then where is she -- in the ice box?
87200,L461471,u2572,m167,DOYLE,She never left the apartment --
87201,L461470,u2574,m167,JEFF,I think they missed their chance with her.
87202,L461469,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife."
87203,L461464,u2574,m167,JEFF,I was jaywalking.
87204,L461463,u2572,m167,DOYLE,By the way  what happened to your leg?
87205,L461459,u2574,m167,JEFF,Do that.
87206,L461458,u2572,m167,DOYLE,We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
87207,L461457,u2574,m167,JEFF,Thanks.
87208,L461456,u2572,m167,DOYLE,I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
87209,L461455,u2574,m167,JEFF,All right -- you don't believe me.
87210,L461454,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff."
87211,L461453,u2574,m167,JEFF,She -- was -- an -- invalid!
87212,L461452,u2572,m167,DOYLE,His wife took a trip.
87213,L461451,u2574,m167,JEFF,For instance?
87214,L461450,u2572,m167,DOYLE,I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
87215,L461449,u2574,m167,JEFF,You think I made all this up?
87216,L461448,u2572,m167,DOYLE,Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
87217,L461447,u2574,m167,JEFF,I'll bet it's been done.
87218,L461446,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage."
87219,L461445,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well, officer -- do your duty."
87220,L461444,u2572,m167,DOYLE,It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
87221,L461443,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand."
87222,L461442,u2572,m167,DOYLE,I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
87223,L461441,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more."
87224,L461440,u2572,m167,DOYLE,"You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?"
87225,L461310,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Yeah.
87226,L461309,u2574,m167,JEFF,"That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy."
87227,L461308,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
87228,L461307,u2574,m167,JEFF,I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
87229,L461306,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Jeff --
87230,L461305,u2574,m167,JEFF,"The word is ""everything."" Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?"
87231,L461304,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Something wrong?
87232,L461303,u2574,m167,JEFF,It's me.
87233,L461302,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,"Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?"
87234,L461301,u2574,m167,JEFF,Gunnison?
87235,L461300,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Hello.
87236,L461104,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Next time, have some good news."
87237,L461103,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,"Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff."
87238,L461102,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag."
87239,L461101,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
87240,L461100,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife."
87241,L461099,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
87242,L461098,u2574,m167,JEFF,I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
87243,L461097,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Like what?
87244,L461096,u2574,m167,JEFF,Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
87245,L461095,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,I'll send you some comic books.
87246,L461094,u2574,m167,JEFF,I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
87247,L461093,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Read some good books.
87248,L461091,u2574,m167,JEFF,You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
87249,L461090,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,"So did you. Goodbye, Jeff."
87250,L461089,u2574,m167,JEFF,You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
87251,L461088,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
87252,L461087,u2574,m167,JEFF,Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
87253,L461086,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
87254,L461085,u2574,m167,JEFF,Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
87255,L461084,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,With that cast on -- you don't.
87256,L461083,u2574,m167,JEFF,Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
87257,L461082,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,You did.
87258,L461081,u2574,m167,JEFF,Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
87259,L461080,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
87260,L461079,u2574,m167,JEFF,Where?
87261,L461075,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week."
87262,L461074,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,"That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called."
87263,L461073,u2574,m167,JEFF,Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
87264,L461072,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,Wrong day?
87265,L461071,u2574,m167,JEFF,Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
87266,L461070,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,This is Wednesday.
87267,L461069,u2574,m167,JEFF,Who said I was getting rid of it?
87268,L461068,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,For getting rid of that cast.
87269,L461067,u2574,m167,JEFF,For what?
87270,L461066,u2573,m167,GUNNISON,"Congratulations, Jeff."
87271,L461065,u2574,m167,JEFF,Jefferies.
87272,L461885,u2579,m167,THORWALD,Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
87273,L461884,u2574,m167,JEFF,I can't. The police have it by now.
87274,L461883,u2579,m167,THORWALD,Tell her to bring it back!
87275,L461882,u2574,m167,JEFF,No.
87276,L461881,u2579,m167,THORWALD,Can you get me that ring back?
87277,L461798,u2574,m167,JEFF,That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
87278,L461797,u2579,m167,THORWALD,I only have a hundred dollars or so.
87279,L461796,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police."
87280,L461795,u2579,m167,THORWALD,I don't know what you mean.
87281,L461794,u2574,m167,JEFF,For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
87282,L461793,u2579,m167,THORWALD,Why should I?
87283,L461792,u2574,m167,JEFF,I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
87284,L461791,u2579,m167,THORWALD,Who are you?
87285,L461790,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?"
87286,L461789,u2574,m167,JEFF,Did you get my note?
87287,L461788,u2579,m167,THORWALD,Hello.
87288,L461849,u2578,m167,STELLA,When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
87289,L461848,u2574,m167,JEFF,What about the rest?
87290,L461847,u2578,m167,STELLA,I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
87291,L461846,u2574,m167,JEFF,Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
87292,L461845,u2578,m167,STELLA,Ten here.
87293,L461844,u2574,m167,JEFF,First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
87294,L461843,u2578,m167,STELLA,How much do you think you'll need?
87295,L461842,u2574,m167,JEFF,One hundred and twenty-seven.
87296,L461840,u2574,m167,JEFF,To bail Lisa out of jail.
87297,L461839,u2578,m167,STELLA,What do you need money for?
87298,L461837,u2578,m167,STELLA,"Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up."
87299,L461836,u2574,m167,JEFF,Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
87300,L461835,u2578,m167,STELLA,When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
87301,L461832,u2574,m167,JEFF,"That'll get her out of there, won't it?"
87302,L461831,u2578,m167,STELLA,Smart? She'll be arrested!
87303,L461830,u2574,m167,JEFF,Smart girl.
87304,L461829,u2578,m167,STELLA,What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
87305,L461778,u2574,m167,JEFF,"There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa."
87306,L461777,u2578,m167,STELLA,"You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there."
87307,L461774,u2574,m167,JEFF,Now wait a minute --
87308,L461773,u2578,m167,STELLA,There's probably one in the basement.
87309,L461772,u2574,m167,JEFF,No.
87310,L461771,u2578,m167,STELLA,Got a shovel?
87311,L461770,u2574,m167,JEFF,What are you two talking about?
87312,L461757,u2574,m167,JEFF,You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
87313,L461756,u2578,m167,STELLA,You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
87314,L461755,u2574,m167,JEFF,Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
87315,L461754,u2578,m167,STELLA,No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
87316,L461753,u2574,m167,JEFF,Would four of them -- ?
87317,L461752,u2578,m167,STELLA,I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
87318,L461751,u2574,m167,JEFF,You can tell that from here?
87319,L461750,u2578,m167,STELLA,Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
87320,L461749,u2574,m167,JEFF,What?
87321,L461748,u2578,m167,STELLA,I wonder.
87322,L461744,u2574,m167,JEFF,I have a feeling we've just begun.
87323,L461743,u2578,m167,STELLA,Thank heaven that's over!
87324,L461742,u2574,m167,JEFF,Look!
87325,L461741,u2578,m167,STELLA,You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
87326,L461726,u2578,m167,STELLA,There's something buried there.
87327,L461725,u2574,m167,JEFF,There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
87328,L461724,u2574,m167,JEFF,And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
87329,L461723,u2578,m167,STELLA,You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
87330,L461717,u2574,m167,JEFF,Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
87331,L461716,u2578,m167,STELLA,Mrs. Thorwald?
87332,L461438,u2574,m167,JEFF,I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
87333,L461437,u2578,m167,STELLA,I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
87334,L461429,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend."
87335,L461428,u2578,m167,STELLA,You called the police?
87336,L461427,u2574,m167,JEFF,Huh?
87337,L461426,u2578,m167,STELLA,Police?
87338,L461425,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you."
87339,L461348,u2574,m167,JEFF,Uh-huh.
87340,L461347,u2578,m167,STELLA,"Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow."
87341,L461346,u2574,m167,JEFF,It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
87342,L461345,u2578,m167,STELLA,I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
87343,L461344,u2574,m167,JEFF,Get back there! He'll see you!
87344,L461343,u2578,m167,STELLA,A Federal offense.
87345,L461339,u2578,m167,STELLA,In this heat?  They're up now.
87346,L461338,u2574,m167,JEFF,No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
87347,L461337,u2578,m167,STELLA,What about this morning? Any developments?
87348,L461336,u2578,m167,STELLA,But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
87349,L461335,u2574,m167,JEFF,Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
87350,L461334,u2578,m167,STELLA,His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
87351,L461333,u2574,m167,JEFF,He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
87352,L461332,u2578,m167,STELLA,Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
87353,L461331,u2574,m167,JEFF,Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
87354,L461330,u2578,m167,STELLA,Isn't he a salesman?
87355,L461329,u2574,m167,JEFF,"It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case."
87356,L461328,u2578,m167,STELLA,He and his wife splitting up?
87357,L461327,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well, the salesman could be available soon."
87358,L461326,u2578,m167,STELLA,Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
87359,L461325,u2574,m167,JEFF,And some man will lose his.
87360,L461324,u2578,m167,STELLA,Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
87361,L461323,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone."
87362,L461322,u2578,m167,STELLA,"And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable."
87363,L461321,u2574,m167,JEFF,"She's real eat, drink and be merry girl."
87364,L461320,u2578,m167,STELLA,Keep your mind off her.
87365,L461318,u2574,m167,JEFF,Depends one which one.
87366,L461317,u2578,m167,STELLA,What'll you do if one of them catches you?
87367,L461316,u2574,m167,JEFF,I was.
87368,L461315,u2578,m167,STELLA,Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
87369,L461314,u2574,m167,JEFF,How did you know!
87370,L461313,u2578,m167,STELLA,"The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair."
87371,L461165,u2574,m167,JEFF,She pay you much?
87372,L461164,u2578,m167,STELLA,Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
87373,L461163,u2574,m167,JEFF,"That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?"
87374,L461162,u2578,m167,STELLA,"When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it."
87375,L461161,u2578,m167,STELLA,Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
87376,L461160,u2574,m167,JEFF,People have different emotional levels that --
87377,L461159,u2578,m167,STELLA,"Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam"
87378,L461158,u2574,m167,JEFF,We've progressed emotionally in --
87379,L461157,u2578,m167,STELLA,Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
87380,L461156,u2574,m167,JEFF,There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
87381,L461155,u2578,m167,STELLA,"Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle."
87382,L461154,u2574,m167,JEFF,That's the hard part.
87383,L461153,u2578,m167,STELLA,"I can just hear you now. ""Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"""
87384,L461152,u2574,m167,JEFF,The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
87385,L461151,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it."
87386,L461150,u2578,m167,STELLA,You're never going to marry?
87387,L461149,u2574,m167,JEFF,Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
87388,L461148,u2578,m167,STELLA,People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
87389,L461147,u2574,m167,JEFF,"It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties."
87390,L461146,u2578,m167,STELLA,Is what you want something you can discuss?
87391,L461145,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want."
87392,L461144,u2578,m167,STELLA,She's only perfect.
87393,L461143,u2574,m167,JEFF,She's just not the girl for me.
87394,L461142,u2578,m167,STELLA,"It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say."
87395,L461141,u2574,m167,JEFF,Stella!
87396,L461140,u2578,m167,STELLA,Her father loading up the shotgun?
87397,L461139,u2574,m167,JEFF,No.
87398,L461138,u2578,m167,STELLA,Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
87399,L461137,u2574,m167,JEFF,She's all right.
87400,L461136,u2578,m167,STELLA,"Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open."
87401,L461135,u2574,m167,JEFF,I'm not ready for marriage.
87402,L461134,u2578,m167,STELLA,That's abnormal.
87403,L461133,u2574,m167,JEFF,I don't want to.
87404,L461132,u2578,m167,STELLA,That's normal.
87405,L461131,u2574,m167,JEFF,She expects me to marry her.
87406,L461130,u2578,m167,STELLA,"You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood."
87407,L461129,u2574,m167,JEFF,Lisa Fremont.
87408,L461128,u2578,m167,STELLA,Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
87409,L461127,u2574,m167,JEFF,Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
87410,L461126,u2578,m167,STELLA,I knew it!
87411,L461124,u2578,m167,STELLA,Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
87412,L461123,u2574,m167,JEFF,How can you tell that from a thermometer!
87413,L461122,u2578,m167,STELLA,You've got a hormone deficiency.
87414,L461121,u2574,m167,JEFF,Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
87415,L461119,u2578,m167,STELLA,"It crashed, didn't it?"
87416,L461118,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none."
87417,L461116,u2574,m167,JEFF,How?
87418,L461115,u2578,m167,STELLA,I predicted it.
87419,L461111,u2578,m167,STELLA,"Well, I only quote from the best."
87420,L461110,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Readers' Digest, April, 1939."
87421,L461534,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Goodnight, Mrs Doyle."
87422,L461533,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,"Goodnight, you idiot."
87423,L461532,u2574,m167,JEFF,"He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man."
87424,L461531,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,Who's Thorwald?
87425,L461530,u2574,m167,JEFF,Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
87426,L461529,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
87427,L461528,u2574,m167,JEFF,"I'm afraid it is, Tess."
87428,L461527,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,"It is something really important, Jeff?"
87429,L461526,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,Not a word.
87430,L461525,u2574,m167,JEFF,You haven't even heard from him?
87431,L461524,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,"Not yet, Jeff."
87432,L461523,u2574,m167,JEFF,Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
87433,L461522,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,Yes.
87434,L461521,u2574,m167,JEFF,Mrs. Doyle?
87435,L461520,u2576,m167,MRS. DOYLE,Hello.
87436,L461893,u2574,m167,JEFF,Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
87437,L461892,u2575,m167,LISA,Shut up. I'm all right.
87438,L461891,u2574,m167,JEFF,Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
87439,L461890,u2575,m167,LISA,Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
87440,L461785,u2575,m167,LISA,"Shall we vote him in, Stella?"
87441,L461784,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word ""we"" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances."
87442,L461783,u2575,m167,LISA,How?
87443,L461782,u2574,m167,JEFF,I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
87444,L461780,u2574,m167,JEFF,Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
87445,L461779,u2575,m167,LISA,What for?
87446,L461776,u2574,m167,JEFF,Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
87447,L461775,u2575,m167,LISA,"Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look."
87448,L461767,u2575,m167,LISA,And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
87449,L461766,u2574,m167,JEFF,Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
87450,L461759,u2574,m167,JEFF,Too close.
87451,L461758,u2575,m167,LISA,Wasn't that close?
87452,L461732,u2575,m167,LISA,"It could be -- the knife, and the saw."
87453,L461731,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again."
87454,L461722,u2574,m167,JEFF,I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
87455,L461721,u2575,m167,LISA,"It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all."
87456,L461720,u2574,m167,JEFF,Well?
87457,L461706,u2574,m167,JEFF,He's washing down the bathroom walls.
87458,L461705,u2575,m167,LISA,Is he cleaning house?
87459,L461704,u2574,m167,JEFF,Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
87460,L461702,u2574,m167,JEFF,"In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window."
87461,L461701,u2575,m167,LISA,But you're not?
87462,L461700,u2574,m167,JEFF,"For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong."
87463,L461695,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood."
87464,L461694,u2575,m167,LISA,Do you like it?
87465,L461693,u2574,m167,JEFF,Thank you.
87466,L461692,u2575,m167,LISA,I'll rephrase the question.
87467,L461690,u2574,m167,JEFF,"No, Lisa -- I don't think he did."
87468,L461689,u2575,m167,LISA,Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
87469,L461686,u2574,m167,JEFF,"I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?"
87470,L461685,u2575,m167,LISA,"Whatever happened to that old saying ""Love Thy Neighbor."""
87471,L461683,u2575,m167,LISA,You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
87472,L461682,u2574,m167,JEFF,Huh?
87473,L461681,u2575,m167,LISA,"Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see."
87474,L461680,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to."
87475,L461679,u2575,m167,LISA,I'm not much on rear window ethics.
87476,L461678,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?"
87477,L461669,u2574,m167,JEFF,Who was the trunk addressed to?
87478,L461668,u2575,m167,LISA,I hate funny exit lines.
87479,L461603,u2575,m167,LISA,Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
87480,L461602,u2574,m167,JEFF,You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
87481,L461601,u2575,m167,LISA,Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
87482,L461600,u2574,m167,JEFF,But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
87483,L461599,u2575,m167,LISA,The same.
87484,L461598,u2574,m167,JEFF,"The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich."
87485,L461597,u2575,m167,LISA,"Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it."
87486,L461596,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Staying the night here, uninvited."
87487,L461595,u2575,m167,LISA,I do?
87488,L461594,u2574,m167,JEFF,You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
87489,L461593,u2575,m167,LISA,It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
87490,L461592,u2574,m167,JEFF,From his landlord -- once a month.
87491,L461589,u2574,m167,JEFF,"I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse."
87492,L461588,u2575,m167,LISA,I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
87493,L461587,u2575,m167,LISA,"A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough."
87494,L461586,u2574,m167,JEFF,That's a suitcase?
87495,L461585,u2575,m167,LISA,You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
87496,L461583,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --"
87497,L461582,u2575,m167,LISA,"Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too."
87498,L461581,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --"
87499,L461580,u2575,m167,LISA,I have the whole weekend off.
87500,L461579,u2574,m167,JEFF,You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
87501,L461578,u2575,m167,LISA,Night. I'm going to stay with you.
87502,L461577,u2574,m167,JEFF,We have all -- what?
87503,L461576,u2575,m167,LISA,Don't rush me. We have all night.
87504,L461575,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though."
87505,L461574,u2575,m167,LISA,I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
87506,L461572,u2575,m167,LISA,"We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet."
87507,L461571,u2574,m167,JEFF,Still -- those witnesses.
87508,L461570,u2575,m167,LISA,"Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women."
87509,L461569,u2574,m167,JEFF,That's what the witnesses told him.
87510,L461568,u2575,m167,LISA,That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
87511,L461567,u2574,m167,JEFF,"I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that."
87512,L461566,u2575,m167,LISA,Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
87513,L461565,u2574,m167,JEFF,Inside stuff?
87514,L461564,u2575,m167,LISA,"They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry."
87515,L461563,u2574,m167,JEFF,Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
87516,L461562,u2575,m167,LISA,"But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up."
87517,L461561,u2574,m167,JEFF,Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
87518,L461560,u2575,m167,LISA,A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
87519,L461559,u2574,m167,JEFF,Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
87520,L461558,u2575,m167,LISA,Women aren't that unpredictable.
87521,L461557,u2574,m167,JEFF,What doesn't?
87522,L461556,u2575,m167,LISA,It doesn't make sense to me.
87523,L461555,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Something on your mind, Lisa?"
87524,L461554,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it."
87525,L461553,u2575,m167,LISA,"And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?"
87526,L461552,u2574,m167,JEFF,Thinking about Thorwald?
87527,L461551,u2575,m167,LISA,All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
87528,L461549,u2574,m167,JEFF,Not yet!
87529,L461548,u2575,m167,LISA,"Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now."
87530,L461547,u2574,m167,JEFF,He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
87531,L461546,u2575,m167,LISA,Suppose he doesn't come back again?
87532,L461545,u2574,m167,JEFF,I don't know.
87533,L461544,u2575,m167,LISA,I wonder where he's going now?
87534,L461543,u2574,m167,JEFF,I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
87535,L461542,u2575,m167,LISA,Someone not his wife?
87536,L461541,u2574,m167,JEFF,"He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone."
87537,L461540,u2575,m167,LISA,What about it?
87538,L461539,u2574,m167,JEFF,That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
87539,L461538,u2574,m167,JEFF,"He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --"
87540,L461537,u2575,m167,LISA,It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
87541,L461419,u2575,m167,LISA,All right -- but what's he doing now?
87542,L461418,u2574,m167,JEFF,To get on home.
87543,L461417,u2575,m167,LISA,"Okay, chief. What's my next assignment."
87544,L461415,u2575,m167,LISA,125 West Ninth Street.
87545,L461414,u2574,m167,JEFF,What's the apartment house number?
87546,L461413,u2575,m167,LISA,"The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald."
87547,L461410,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?"
87548,L461409,u2575,m167,LISA,Don't you see how silly you're being?
87549,L461408,u2574,m167,JEFF,No comment.
87550,L461406,u2575,m167,LISA,And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
87551,L461405,u2574,m167,JEFF,That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
87552,L461404,u2575,m167,LISA,"Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?"
87553,L461403,u2574,m167,JEFF,Yeah.
87554,L461402,u2575,m167,LISA,"You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?"
87555,L461401,u2574,m167,JEFF,What are you getting at?
87556,L461400,u2575,m167,LISA,"You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?"
87557,L461399,u2574,m167,JEFF,It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
87558,L461398,u2575,m167,LISA,"Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking."
87559,L461397,u2574,m167,JEFF,"There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!"
87560,L461396,u2575,m167,LISA,There's nothing to see.
87561,L461395,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Lisa, please!"
87562,L461394,u2575,m167,LISA,"She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now."
87563,L461393,u2574,m167,JEFF,Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
87564,L461392,u2575,m167,LISA,Maybe she died.
87565,L461391,u2575,m167,LISA,A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
87566,L461390,u2575,m167,LISA,What makes you think something's wrong with her?
87567,L461389,u2574,m167,JEFF,I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
87568,L461388,u2575,m167,LISA,What is it you're looking for?
87569,L461387,u2574,m167,JEFF,You'd better before you catch the disease!
87570,L461386,u2575,m167,LISA,"I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here."
87571,L461385,u2574,m167,JEFF,Do you think I consider this recreation?
87572,L461384,u2575,m167,LISA,"Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!"
87573,L461383,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Now, Lisa --"
87574,L461382,u2575,m167,LISA,Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
87575,L461375,u2575,m167,LISA,Something too frightful to utter.
87576,L461374,u2574,m167,JEFF,What do you think?
87577,L461372,u2574,m167,JEFF,Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
87578,L461371,u2575,m167,LISA,I wouldn't dare answer that.
87579,L461370,u2574,m167,JEFF,Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
87580,L461369,u2575,m167,LISA,"Nothing, thank heaven."
87581,L461368,u2574,m167,JEFF,What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
87582,L461367,u2575,m167,LISA,Homework. It's more interesting.
87583,L461366,u2574,m167,JEFF,Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
87584,L461365,u2575,m167,LISA,He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
87585,L461364,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?"
87586,L461363,u2575,m167,LISA,Tell me about it.
87587,L461362,u2574,m167,JEFF,So do I.
87588,L461361,u2575,m167,LISA,I have one now.
87589,L461360,u2574,m167,JEFF,Don't you ever have any problems?
87590,L461359,u2575,m167,LISA,"Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him."
87591,L461358,u2574,m167,JEFF,I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
87592,L461297,u2575,m167,LISA,Without any future?
87593,L461296,u2574,m167,JEFF,Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
87594,L461294,u2575,m167,LISA,I mean what I said.
87595,L461293,u2574,m167,JEFF,"You mean ""goodnight."""
87596,L461292,u2575,m167,LISA,"Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff."
87597,L461291,u2574,m167,JEFF,"There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand."
87598,L461290,u2575,m167,LISA,And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
87599,L461288,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Right now, it doesn't seem so."
87600,L461287,u2575,m167,LISA,You don't think either one of us could ever change?
87601,L461280,u2574,m167,JEFF,"If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are."
87602,L461279,u2575,m167,LISA,"Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong."
87603,L461278,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!"
87604,L461276,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?"
87605,L461275,u2575,m167,LISA,Three.
87606,L461274,u2574,m167,JEFF,Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
87607,L461273,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?"
87608,L461272,u2575,m167,LISA,"Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch."
87609,L461271,u2574,m167,JEFF,"You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?"
87610,L461270,u2575,m167,LISA,Of course not.
87611,L461269,u2574,m167,JEFF,Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
87612,L461268,u2574,m167,JEFF,Lisa! Shut up!
87613,L461267,u2575,m167,LISA,"You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --"
87614,L461266,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Lisa, simmer down -- will you?"
87615,L461263,u2575,m167,LISA,"It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people."
87616,L461262,u2574,m167,JEFF,"All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --"
87617,L461261,u2575,m167,LISA,"What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation."
87618,L461260,u2574,m167,JEFF,Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
87619,L461259,u2575,m167,LISA,"It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?"
87620,L461258,u2574,m167,JEFF,There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
87621,L461257,u2575,m167,LISA,"If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --"
87622,L461252,u2574,m167,JEFF,No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
87623,L461251,u2575,m167,LISA,Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
87624,L461250,u2575,m167,LISA,I think it's enchanting.
87625,L461249,u2574,m167,JEFF,Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
87626,L461247,u2575,m167,LISA,"You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?"
87627,L461246,u2574,m167,JEFF,How can you tell that -- from here?
87628,L461245,u2575,m167,LISA,She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
87629,L461244,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one."
87630,L461243,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso."
87631,L461242,u2575,m167,LISA,Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
87632,L461241,u2574,m167,JEFF,Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
87633,L461240,u2575,m167,LISA,"That's what is know as ""manless melancholia."""
87634,L461238,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?"
87635,L461237,u2575,m167,LISA,I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
87636,L461236,u2574,m167,JEFF,That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
87637,L461235,u2575,m167,LISA,Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
87638,L461234,u2575,m167,LISA,"For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --"
87639,L461233,u2574,m167,JEFF,For what?
87640,L461232,u2575,m167,LISA,Yes.
87641,L461231,u2574,m167,JEFF,You mean leave the magazine?
87642,L461230,u2575,m167,LISA,Make the one you want.
87643,L461229,u2574,m167,JEFF,I wish there was one I wanted.
87644,L461228,u2575,m167,LISA,Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
87645,L461227,u2574,m167,JEFF,How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
87646,L461226,u2575,m167,LISA,Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
87647,L461225,u2574,m167,JEFF,That's good news.
87648,L461224,u2575,m167,LISA,You can't buy that kind of publicity.
87649,L461222,u2575,m167,LISA,She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
87650,L461221,u2574,m167,JEFF,Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
87651,L461220,u2575,m167,LISA,"Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the ""21"" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change."
87652,L461219,u2574,m167,JEFF,Tired?
87653,L461218,u2575,m167,LISA,What a day I've had!
87654,L461212,u2575,m167,LISA,"Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget."
87655,L461211,u2574,m167,JEFF,Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
87656,L461210,u2575,m167,LISA,I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
87657,L461209,u2574,m167,JEFF,Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
87658,L461208,u2575,m167,LISA,Big enough?
87659,L461198,u2574,m167,JEFF,"You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?"
87660,L461197,u2575,m167,LISA,"What would you think of starting off with dinner at the ""21""?"
87661,L461196,u2575,m167,LISA,"I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!"
87662,L461195,u2574,m167,JEFF,Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
87663,L461194,u2575,m167,LISA,"It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved."
87664,L461193,u2574,m167,JEFF,Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
87665,L461191,u2574,m167,JEFF,Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
87666,L461190,u2575,m167,LISA,It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
87667,L461189,u2574,m167,JEFF,It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
87668,L461188,u2575,m167,LISA,Going on right here. It's a big night.
87669,L461187,u2574,m167,JEFF,Something big going on somewhere?
87670,L461185,u2574,m167,JEFF,Who buys them? Tax collectors?
87671,L461184,u2575,m167,LISA,We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
87672,L461183,u2574,m167,JEFF,That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
87673,L461182,u2575,m167,LISA,-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
87674,L461181,u2574,m167,JEFF,"Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --"
87675,L461179,u2575,m167,LISA,Only because it's expected of her.
87676,L461178,u2574,m167,JEFF,The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
87677,L461174,u2574,m167,JEFF,Uh-huh.
87678,L461173,u2575,m167,LISA,Anything else bothering you?

87708,L462396,u2580,m168,BUZZ,"I like you, you know?"

87722,L462251,u2580,m168,BUZZ,"How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead."
87723,L462250,u2585,m168,JIM,You satisfied or you want more?
87724,L462232,u2580,m168,BUZZ,Somebody find him a knife.
87725,L462231,u2585,m168,JIM,Machismo?
87726,L462228,u2580,m168,BUZZ,"Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game."
87727,L462227,u2585,m168,JIM,I thought only punks fought with knives.
87728,L462224,u2585,m168,JIM,Chicken?
87729,L462223,u2580,m168,BUZZ,What?
87730,L462222,u2585,m168,JIM,Meaning me?
87731,L462221,u2585,m168,JIM,"I'm cute, too."
87732,L462220,u2580,m168,BUZZ,"Hey, he's real abstract and different."
87733,L462219,u2585,m168,JIM,You watch too much television.
87734,L462218,u2580,m168,BUZZ,What?
87735,L462217,u2585,m168,JIM,You know something?
87736,L462761,u2591,m168,OFFICER,Down in back.
87737,L462760,u2581,m168,CHIEF,Any other entrance?
87738,L462759,u2591,m168,OFFICER,Smashed the front door.
87739,L462758,u2581,m168,CHIEF,How'd he get in?
87740,L462757,u2591,m168,OFFICER,We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
87741,L462756,u2581,m168,CHIEF,We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
87742,L462647,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
87743,L462646,u2588,m168,MOOSE,No.
87744,L462645,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,"You still want to go home, Moose?"
87745,L462644,u2588,m168,MOOSE,That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
87746,L462643,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,Hang loose.  We got all night.
87747,L462642,u2588,m168,MOOSE,What time is it?
87748,L462498,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,You clean out of your head?  Come on!
87749,L462497,u2588,m168,MOOSE,Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
87750,L462496,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,No.  We're going to bring him down.
87751,L462495,u2588,m168,MOOSE,I think I should go home.
87752,L462494,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,"He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!"
87753,L462493,u2588,m168,MOOSE,No--
87754,L462492,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,You see any cops?
87755,L462488,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,You see any cops?
87756,L462487,u2588,m168,MOOSE,"Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--"
87757,L462486,u2582,m168,CRUNCH,What's he going to pull--
87758,L462834,u2583,m168,FATHER,"And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear."
87759,L462833,u2585,m168,JIM,He depended on me.
87760,L462478,u2585,m168,JIM,"You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?"
87761,L462477,u2583,m168,FATHER,Son--this is all happening so fast--
87762,L462472,u2585,m168,JIM,I don't want to learn that!
87763,L462471,u2583,m168,FATHER,"You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim."
87764,L462468,u2585,m168,JIM,No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
87765,L462467,u2583,m168,FATHER,"You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?"
87766,L462464,u2585,m168,JIM,You don't want me to go.
87767,L462463,u2583,m168,FATHER,Will you wait a minute?
87768,L462462,u2585,m168,JIM,Except yourself!
87769,L462454,u2583,m168,FATHER,Well--
87770,L462453,u2585,m168,JIM,I don't think so--
87771,L462450,u2583,m168,FATHER,You what?
87772,L462449,u2585,m168,JIM,Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
87773,L462448,u2583,m168,FATHER,You're absolutely right!
87774,L462447,u2585,m168,JIM,"That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another."
87775,L462446,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Well, just get it off your chest, son."
87776,L462440,u2585,m168,JIM,She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
87777,L462439,u2583,m168,FATHER,Will you let him tell it!
87778,L462433,u2585,m168,JIM,I was in it.
87779,L462432,u2583,m168,FATHER,Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
87780,L462431,u2585,m168,JIM,I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
87781,L462430,u2583,m168,FATHER,Go ahead.
87782,L462352,u2583,m168,FATHER,I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
87783,L462351,u2585,m168,JIM,"Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!"
87784,L462350,u2583,m168,FATHER,You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
87785,L462349,u2585,m168,JIM,"Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?"
87786,L462348,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Well, now--"
87787,L462347,u2585,m168,JIM,What can you do when you have to be a man?
87788,L462346,u2583,m168,FATHER,We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
87789,L462345,u2585,m168,JIM,We don't have time.
87790,L462344,u2583,m168,FATHER,Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
87791,L462343,u2585,m168,JIM,The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
87792,L462342,u2583,m168,FATHER,How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
87793,L462341,u2585,m168,JIM,Blood.
87794,L462340,u2583,m168,FATHER,I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
87795,L462339,u2585,m168,JIM,"What would you do, Dad?"
87796,L462338,u2583,m168,FATHER,Is there some kind of trick answer?
87797,L462337,u2585,m168,JIM,Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
87798,L462336,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Shoot, Jimbo."
87799,L462335,u2585,m168,JIM,Hey--I want to ask you something.
87800,L462334,u2585,m168,JIM,I'm not hungry.
87801,L462333,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?"
87802,L462332,u2585,m168,JIM,Yes.
87803,L462331,u2583,m168,FATHER,You awake?
87804,L462287,u2583,m168,FATHER,I better clean this up before she sees it.
87805,L462286,u2585,m168,JIM,That's funny!
87806,L462285,u2583,m168,FATHER,Yeah!  Shh!
87807,L462284,u2585,m168,JIM,And you dropped it?
87808,L462283,u2583,m168,FATHER,It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
87809,L462282,u2585,m168,JIM,Yeah!
87810,L462281,u2583,m168,FATHER,You thought I was Mom?
87811,L462104,u2583,m168,FATHER,And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
87812,L462103,u2585,m168,JIM,Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
87813,L462102,u2583,m168,FATHER,"So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!"
87814,L462095,u2583,m168,FATHER,"My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--"
87815,L462094,u2585,m168,JIM,You make any sandwiches?
87816,L462093,u2583,m168,FATHER,Mother--
87817,L462016,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?"
87818,L462015,u2585,m168,JIM,You buy me many things.  Thank you.
87819,L462014,u2583,m168,FATHER,You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
87820,L462013,u2585,m168,JIM,You can't protect me.
87821,L462012,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Hold it, Jim."
87822,L462011,u2585,m168,JIM,Tell him why we moved here.
87823,L462775,u2583,m168,FATHER,I think I know my son.
87824,L462774,u2593,m168,RAY,You sure?
87825,L462082,u2593,m168,RAY,"No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark."
87826,L462081,u2583,m168,FATHER,Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
87827,L462080,u2593,m168,RAY,"No thanks, I don't smoke."
87828,L462079,u2583,m168,FATHER,Have some cigars.
87829,L462078,u2593,m168,RAY,"Luck, Jim.  Don't forget."
87830,L462028,u2583,m168,FATHER,Sure.  Sure.
87831,L462027,u2593,m168,RAY,Excuse us a minute?
87832,L462005,u2593,m168,RAY,"What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?"
87833,L462004,u2583,m168,FATHER,Sorry.
87834,L462003,u2593,m168,RAY,Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
87835,L461998,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Say, listen--"
87836,L461997,u2593,m168,RAY,"He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink."
87837,L461996,u2583,m168,FATHER,No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
87838,L461995,u2593,m168,RAY,You don't?
87839,L461994,u2583,m168,FATHER,I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
87840,L462773,u2583,m168,FATHER,Stay here.  That was my son!
87841,L462772,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Frank!
87842,L462592,u2583,m168,FATHER,"No, honey.  No, he's not here."
87843,L462591,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Is he there?
87844,L462581,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Open it.
87845,L462580,u2583,m168,FATHER,Who's there?  Anyone there?
87846,L462579,u2589,m168,MOTHER,I still think you should go down.
87847,L462578,u2583,m168,FATHER,See?  It stopped.
87848,L462577,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Look--just relax, will you?"
87849,L462576,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Are you going down there?
87850,L462575,u2583,m168,FATHER,He's home.  I heard the car.
87851,L462574,u2589,m168,MOTHER,I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
87852,L462573,u2583,m168,FATHER,What's that pounding?
87853,L462572,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Frank?  I'm frightened.
87854,L462461,u2589,m168,MOTHER,That's right!
87855,L462460,u2583,m168,FATHER,I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
87856,L462459,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
87857,L462458,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--"
87858,L462452,u2583,m168,FATHER,Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
87859,L462451,u2589,m168,MOTHER,No!
87860,L462442,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Just relax, please relax!"
87861,L462441,u2589,m168,MOTHER,I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
87862,L462019,u2589,m168,MOTHER,A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
87863,L462018,u2583,m168,FATHER,Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
87864,L462010,u2583,m168,FATHER,"Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--"
87865,L462009,u2589,m168,MOTHER,I was talking to Jim.
87866,L462008,u2583,m168,FATHER,"He's just loaded, honey."
87867,L462007,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
87868,L462002,u2583,m168,FATHER,Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
87869,L462001,u2589,m168,MOTHER,"Really, Frank?  When was that?"
87870,L462000,u2583,m168,FATHER,I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
87871,L461993,u2584,m168,GENE,Well maybe she better start.
87872,L461992,u2590,m168,NEGRO WOMAN,"Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!"
87873,L461989,u2584,m168,GENE,"Do you hear from him, son?"
87874,L461988,u2590,m168,NEGRO WOMAN,"They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now."
87875,L461985,u2584,m168,GENE,"Where's your mother tonight, Plato?"
87876,L461984,u2590,m168,NEGRO WOMAN,"She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house."
87877,L461967,u2584,m168,GENE,"Come with me, John."
87878,L461966,u2590,m168,NEGRO WOMAN,"Yes, sir."
87879,L461965,u2584,m168,GENE,John Crawford?
87880,L461991,u2592,m168,PLATO,Head-shrinker?
87881,L461990,u2584,m168,GENE,You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
87882,L461983,u2592,m168,PLATO,In my mother's drawer.
87883,L461982,u2584,m168,GENE,Where did you get the gun?
87884,L461981,u2592,m168,PLATO,I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
87885,L461980,u2584,m168,GENE,"What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?"
87886,L461979,u2592,m168,PLATO,"No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?"
87887,L461978,u2584,m168,GENE,"Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?"
87888,L461975,u2592,m168,PLATO,Plato.
87889,L461974,u2584,m168,GENE,"Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?"
87890,L462514,u2594,m168,SERGEANT,"Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?"
87891,L462513,u2585,m168,JIM,I'll wait for him.
87892,L462512,u2594,m168,SERGEANT,Come back tomorrow.
87893,L462511,u2585,m168,JIM,My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
87894,L462510,u2594,m168,SERGEANT,He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
87895,L462507,u2594,m168,SERGEANT,What's the charge?
87896,L462506,u2585,m168,JIM,I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
87897,L462502,u2594,m168,SERGEANT,Look--can't you see I'm writing?
87898,L462501,u2585,m168,JIM,Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
87899,L462825,u2592,m168,PLATO,Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
87900,L462824,u2585,m168,JIM,Plato!
87901,L462821,u2585,m168,JIM,Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
87902,L462820,u2592,m168,PLATO,Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
87903,L462819,u2585,m168,JIM,But you didn't hurt anybody.
87904,L462818,u2592,m168,PLATO,I shot at one of them.
87905,L462817,u2585,m168,JIM,Just a guard.
87906,L462816,u2592,m168,PLATO,Who's that?
87907,L462813,u2592,m168,PLATO,Come on!
87908,L462812,u2585,m168,JIM,They like you.  Okay?
87909,L462811,u2592,m168,PLATO,Why?
87910,L462810,u2585,m168,JIM,"Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out."
87911,L462809,u2592,m168,PLATO,You promised to give it back.
87912,L462808,u2585,m168,JIM,"You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second."
87913,L462807,u2592,m168,PLATO,I need it.
87914,L462806,u2585,m168,JIM,In your pocket.  Give it to me.
87915,L462805,u2592,m168,PLATO,My gun?
87916,L462804,u2585,m168,JIM,"You want to give me your gun now, Plato?"
87917,L462803,u2585,m168,JIM,What do you think?
87918,L462802,u2592,m168,PLATO,Can I keep it?
87919,L462801,u2585,m168,JIM,I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
87920,L462800,u2592,m168,PLATO,No.
87921,L462799,u2585,m168,JIM,Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
87922,L462798,u2592,m168,PLATO,You sure?
87923,L462797,u2585,m168,JIM,We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
87924,L462796,u2585,m168,JIM,I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
87925,L462793,u2585,m168,JIM,"Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you."
87926,L462792,u2592,m168,PLATO,Here.
87927,L462791,u2585,m168,JIM,I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
87928,L462790,u2592,m168,PLATO,Why?
87929,L462789,u2585,m168,JIM,No.  At dawn.
87930,L462788,u2592,m168,PLATO,"You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?"
87931,L462787,u2592,m168,PLATO,I'm fine.
87932,L462786,u2585,m168,JIM,That's swell.  How are you?
87933,L462785,u2585,m168,JIM,"I know.  Light a match, will you?"
87934,L462784,u2592,m168,PLATO,I've got a gun.
87935,L462783,u2585,m168,JIM,"Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?"
87936,L462782,u2592,m168,PLATO,I'm here.
87937,L462781,u2585,m168,JIM,Plato?
87938,L462725,u2592,m168,PLATO,Get away from me!
87939,L462724,u2585,m168,JIM,"You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!"
87940,L462723,u2585,m168,JIM,Your father!
87941,L462722,u2592,m168,PLATO,I don't want you for my father!
87942,L462721,u2585,m168,JIM,Plato!
87943,L462720,u2592,m168,PLATO,What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
87944,L462668,u2585,m168,JIM,"You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday."
87945,L462667,u2592,m168,PLATO,Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
87946,L462666,u2585,m168,JIM,Who?
87947,L462665,u2592,m168,PLATO,When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
87948,L462664,u2585,m168,JIM,When was that?
87949,L462663,u2592,m168,PLATO,I came here before.
87950,L462660,u2592,m168,PLATO,"I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead."
87951,L462659,u2585,m168,JIM,"How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?"
87952,L462658,u2585,m168,JIM,Not lately.
87953,L462657,u2592,m168,PLATO,Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
87954,L462656,u2585,m168,JIM,Hey!  How 'bout that!
87955,L462655,u2592,m168,PLATO,Isn't he schizoid?
87956,L462652,u2585,m168,JIM,I'm what?  What?
87957,L462651,u2592,m168,PLATO,"Man, you're schizoid!"
87958,L462650,u2585,m168,JIM,Let's see how long we can stay under.
87959,L462641,u2592,m168,PLATO,Come on!
87960,L462640,u2585,m168,JIM,We'll take it!
87961,L462639,u2592,m168,PLATO,There's only one key.
87962,L462638,u2585,m168,JIM,What?
87963,L462637,u2592,m168,PLATO,It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
87964,L462636,u2585,m168,JIM,Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
87965,L462620,u2585,m168,JIM,Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
87966,L462619,u2592,m168,PLATO,Isn't it crazy?
87967,L462618,u2585,m168,JIM,Wow!  Well now-there-then!
87968,L462617,u2592,m168,PLATO,We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
87969,L462616,u2585,m168,JIM,No.  I'm scared.
87970,L462615,u2592,m168,PLATO,Shut up.  Are you nuts?
87971,L462614,u2585,m168,JIM,Come out come out wherever you are!
87972,L462613,u2592,m168,PLATO,I'm here.  Shut up.
87973,L462612,u2585,m168,JIM,Hey where'd you go?
87974,L462611,u2592,m168,PLATO,Help me in!
87975,L462610,u2585,m168,JIM,Judy.
87976,L462609,u2592,m168,PLATO,They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
87977,L462608,u2585,m168,JIM,We know.
87978,L462607,u2592,m168,PLATO,Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
87979,L462606,u2585,m168,JIM,Yeah?
87980,L462605,u2592,m168,PLATO,They're looking for you!--
87981,L462604,u2585,m168,JIM,How'd you find me?  What's happening?
87982,L462603,u2592,m168,PLATO,It's me!
87983,L462602,u2585,m168,JIM,Who's that!
87984,L462601,u2592,m168,PLATO,Jim!
87985,L462423,u2585,m168,JIM,Yeah.
87986,L462422,u2592,m168,PLATO,O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
87987,L462421,u2585,m168,JIM,Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
87988,L462420,u2592,m168,PLATO,If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
87989,L462419,u2585,m168,JIM,Who has?
87990,L462418,u2592,m168,PLATO,"Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to."
87991,L462417,u2585,m168,JIM,I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
87992,L462368,u2585,m168,JIM,No.  It's okay.
87993,L462367,u2592,m168,PLATO,My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
87994,L462366,u2585,m168,JIM,"Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging."
87995,L462365,u2592,m168,PLATO,I hitched.
87996,L462364,u2585,m168,JIM,How'd you get here?
87997,L462278,u2585,m168,JIM,What's a chickie-run?
87998,L462277,u2592,m168,PLATO,What?
87999,L462276,u2585,m168,JIM,Who knows.  Plato?
88000,L462275,u2592,m168,PLATO,Are you really going to meet them?
88001,L462209,u2585,m168,JIM,No.  In the morning.
88002,L462208,u2592,m168,PLATO,Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
88003,L462207,u2592,m168,PLATO,They're still there!
88004,L462206,u2585,m168,JIM,I'm here.
88005,L462204,u2585,m168,JIM,"Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!"
88006,L462203,u2592,m168,PLATO,No.  It's perpetual motion.
88007,L462202,u2585,m168,JIM,"I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?"
88008,L462201,u2592,m168,PLATO,He has a knife.
88009,L462200,u2585,m168,JIM,I just don't want trouble.
88010,L462199,u2592,m168,PLATO,You scared?
88011,L462198,u2585,m168,JIM,I know.  That's why I came back.
88012,L462197,u2592,m168,PLATO,"Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you."
88013,L462196,u2592,m168,PLATO,Plato.  It's a nickname.
88014,L462195,u2585,m168,JIM,Jim.  What's yours?
88015,L462194,u2592,m168,PLATO,What's your name!
88016,L462179,u2585,m168,JIM,I don't want to make friends.
88017,L462178,u2592,m168,PLATO,He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
88018,L462177,u2585,m168,JIM,What?
88019,L462176,u2592,m168,PLATO,You shouldn't monkey with him.
88020,L462164,u2585,m168,JIM,"Once you been up there, you know you been some place!"
88021,L462163,u2592,m168,PLATO,What?
88022,L462162,u2585,m168,JIM,Boy!
88023,L462156,u2592,m168,PLATO,I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
88024,L462155,u2585,m168,JIM,No.  I don't think so--
88025,L462154,u2592,m168,PLATO,You remember me?
88026,L462153,u2585,m168,JIM,Hi there.
88027,L462152,u2592,m168,PLATO,Hi.
88028,L462480,u2585,m168,JIM,Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
88029,L462479,u2589,m168,MOTHER,"Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life."
88030,L462476,u2585,m168,JIM,"You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?"
88031,L462475,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Do I have to spell it out?
88032,L462474,u2585,m168,JIM,No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
88033,L462473,u2589,m168,MOTHER,"Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving."
88034,L462470,u2585,m168,JIM,Just tell a little white lie?
88035,L462469,u2589,m168,MOTHER,He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
88036,L462466,u2585,m168,JIM,"But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!"
88037,L462465,u2589,m168,MOTHER,No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
88038,L462457,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Why should you be the only one.
88039,L462456,u2585,m168,JIM,What's that got to do with it?
88040,L462455,u2589,m168,MOTHER,What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
88041,L462445,u2585,m168,JIM,I can't keep it to myself anymore--
88042,L462444,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Good Lord!
88043,L462443,u2585,m168,JIM,"I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed."
88044,L462438,u2589,m168,MOTHER,And you wanted him to make a list!
88045,L462437,u2585,m168,JIM,Mom--I'm not--
88046,L462436,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
88047,L462435,u2585,m168,JIM,It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
88048,L462434,u2589,m168,MOTHER,How!
88049,L462429,u2585,m168,JIM,"I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer."
88050,L462428,u2589,m168,MOTHER,"What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home."
88051,L462101,u2589,m168,MOTHER,"Goodbye, dear."
88052,L462100,u2585,m168,JIM,"'Bye, Mom."
88053,L462089,u2585,m168,JIM,"It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--"
88054,L462088,u2589,m168,MOTHER,Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
88055,L462075,u2589,m168,MOTHER,"All right, darling."
88056,L462074,u2585,m168,JIM,I'm sorry.
88057,L462024,u2589,m168,MOTHER,That's a fine way to behave!
88058,L462023,u2585,m168,JIM,Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
88059,L462022,u2589,m168,MOTHER,What?
88060,L462073,u2585,m168,JIM,You serious?
88061,L462072,u2593,m168,RAY,Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
88062,L462071,u2585,m168,JIM,Okay--
88063,L462070,u2593,m168,RAY,"Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks."
88064,L462069,u2585,m168,JIM,Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
88065,L462068,u2593,m168,RAY,"You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?"
88066,L462067,u2585,m168,JIM,How can anyone grow up in this circus?
88067,L462066,u2585,m168,JIM,"I bet you see right through me, don't you?"
88068,L462065,u2593,m168,RAY,Chicken?
88069,L462064,u2585,m168,JIM,I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
88070,L462063,u2593,m168,RAY,"""If he could"" what?  You mean your father?"
88071,L462062,u2585,m168,JIM,If he could--
88072,L462061,u2593,m168,RAY,Pretty mixed up?
88073,L462060,u2585,m168,JIM,"A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die."
88074,L462059,u2593,m168,RAY,What?
88075,L462058,u2585,m168,JIM,What a zoo!
88076,L462057,u2585,m168,JIM,She eats him alive and he takes it.
88077,L462056,u2593,m168,RAY,Things pretty tough for you at home?
88078,L462055,u2593,m168,RAY,But you don't think that's a solution.
88079,L462054,u2585,m168,JIM,They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
88080,L462053,u2593,m168,RAY,So then you moved?
88081,L462052,u2585,m168,JIM,They never do.
88082,L462051,u2593,m168,RAY,And your folks didn't understand?
88083,L462050,u2585,m168,JIM,He called me chicken.
88084,L462049,u2585,m168,JIM,Mess that kid up?
88085,L462048,u2593,m168,RAY,You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
88086,L462047,u2585,m168,JIM,And they think they are protecting my by moving.
88087,L462046,u2593,m168,RAY,That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
88088,L462045,u2593,m168,RAY,Try the desk.
88089,L462044,u2585,m168,JIM,All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
88090,L462043,u2593,m168,RAY,You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
88091,L462042,u2585,m168,JIM,"I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out."
88092,L462041,u2593,m168,RAY,Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
88093,L462040,u2585,m168,JIM,I don't know why--!
88094,L462039,u2593,m168,RAY,No.
88095,L462038,u2585,m168,JIM,Leave me alone.
88096,L462037,u2593,m168,RAY,Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
88097,L462036,u2585,m168,JIM,No.
88098,L462035,u2593,m168,RAY,"Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?"
88099,L462034,u2593,m168,RAY,"Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?"
88100,L462033,u2585,m168,JIM,Wash up and go home.
88101,L462032,u2593,m168,RAY,"Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you."
88102,L462031,u2585,m168,JIM,Get lost.
88103,L462030,u2593,m168,RAY,Grandma?
88104,L462029,u2585,m168,JIM,Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
88105,L462733,u2591,m168,OFFICER,Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
88106,L462732,u2585,m168,JIM,Plato!
88107,L462509,u2585,m168,JIM,Listen--
88108,L462508,u2591,m168,OFFICER,Assault with a deadly weapon.
88109,L461954,u2585,m168,JIM,"Yes, ma'am."
88110,L461953,u2591,m168,OFFICER,Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
88111,L461952,u2585,m168,JIM,Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
88112,L461951,u2591,m168,OFFICER,Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
88113,L462752,u2586,m168,JUDY,They're killing him!
88114,L462751,u2585,m168,JIM,Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
88115,L462750,u2586,m168,JUDY,You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
88116,L462748,u2586,m168,JUDY,"He needed you, maybe.  So do I."
88117,L462747,u2585,m168,JIM,He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
88118,L462746,u2586,m168,JUDY,After he tried to shoot you?
88119,L462745,u2585,m168,JIM,No!  I got to find him.
88120,L462744,u2586,m168,JUDY,We have to go back!
88121,L462743,u2585,m168,JIM,No!
88122,L462706,u2586,m168,JUDY,"I love you, Jim.  I really mean it."
88123,L462705,u2585,m168,JIM,It is for me too.
88124,L462704,u2586,m168,JUDY,I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
88125,L462703,u2585,m168,JIM,"It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me."
88126,L462702,u2586,m168,JUDY,I never felt so clean before.
88127,L462701,u2585,m168,JIM,So do you.
88128,L462700,u2586,m168,JUDY,You smell like baby powder.
88129,L462699,u2585,m168,JIM,What?
88130,L462698,u2586,m168,JUDY,Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
88131,L462697,u2585,m168,JIM,You disappointed?
88132,L462696,u2586,m168,JUDY,Is this what it's like to love somebody?
88133,L462695,u2585,m168,JIM,What a relief!
88134,L462694,u2586,m168,JUDY,I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
88135,L462693,u2585,m168,JIM,"There's something I should tell you, Judy."
88136,L462692,u2586,m168,JUDY,You don't need to do that.
88137,L462691,u2585,m168,JIM,Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
88138,L462690,u2586,m168,JUDY,Are you?
88139,L462689,u2585,m168,JIM,Maybe he's scared of the dark.
88140,L462688,u2586,m168,JUDY,I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
88141,L462687,u2585,m168,JIM,Why?
88142,L462686,u2586,m168,JUDY,Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
88143,L462685,u2585,m168,JIM,What?
88144,L462684,u2585,m168,JIM,Hi.
88145,L462683,u2586,m168,JUDY,Hi.
88146,L462682,u2585,m168,JIM,Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
88147,L462680,u2585,m168,JIM,Should we explore?
88148,L462679,u2586,m168,JUDY,I don't know.
88149,L462678,u2585,m168,JIM,How many rooms do you think there are?
88150,L462677,u2586,m168,JUDY,Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
88151,L462676,u2585,m168,JIM,Ever been in a place like this before?
88152,L462654,u2585,m168,JIM,I bet you hear everything I say!
88153,L462653,u2586,m168,JUDY,You can't talk underwater!
88154,L462633,u2586,m168,JUDY,"See, we're very modern."
88155,L462632,u2585,m168,JIM,Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
88156,L462629,u2586,m168,JUDY,There's just one thing.  What about--
88157,L462628,u2585,m168,JIM,Well--we're newlyweds.
88158,L462627,u2586,m168,JUDY,"You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!"
88159,L462626,u2585,m168,JIM,Why don't we just rent it for the season?
88160,L462623,u2586,m168,JUDY,"You decide, darling.  Remember our budget."
88161,L462622,u2585,m168,JIM,"No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?"
88162,L462621,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Oh, Jim!"
88163,L462571,u2586,m168,JUDY,I feel as if I'm walking under water.
88164,L462570,u2585,m168,JIM,"You can trust me, Judy."
88165,L462569,u2585,m168,JIM,Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
88166,L462568,u2586,m168,JUDY,I'm never going back.
88167,L462567,u2585,m168,JIM,Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
88168,L462566,u2586,m168,JUDY,"I don't know, but we can't stay here."
88169,L462565,u2585,m168,JIM,Where you going?
88170,L462564,u2586,m168,JUDY,Your lips are soft when you kiss.
88171,L462563,u2585,m168,JIM,I felt like it.
88172,L462562,u2586,m168,JUDY,Why did you do that?
88173,L462561,u2585,m168,JIM,Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
88174,L462560,u2586,m168,JUDY,So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
88175,L462559,u2585,m168,JIM,Sure.  Lots of times.
88176,L462558,u2586,m168,JUDY,Have you ever gone with anyone who--
88177,L462557,u2585,m168,JIM,"I'm getting that way, too."
88178,L462556,u2586,m168,JUDY,Why?
88179,L462555,u2585,m168,JIM,"I don't think you trust anybody, do you?"
88180,L462554,u2586,m168,JUDY,If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
88181,L462553,u2585,m168,JIM,Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
88182,L462552,u2586,m168,JUDY,I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
88183,L462551,u2585,m168,JIM,"Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing."
88184,L462549,u2585,m168,JIM,"Every day I look in the mirror and say, ""What?  You still here?"" Man!"
88185,L462548,u2586,m168,JUDY,No.
88186,L462547,u2585,m168,JIM,No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
88187,L462546,u2586,m168,JUDY,Neither can I.
88188,L462545,u2585,m168,JIM,"I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again."
88189,L462544,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold."
88190,L462543,u2585,m168,JIM,You cold?
88191,L462542,u2586,m168,JUDY,I'm numb.
88192,L462541,u2585,m168,JIM,You still pretty upset?
88193,L462538,u2585,m168,JIM,I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
88194,L462537,u2586,m168,JUDY,No--I was just--maybe--
88195,L462536,u2585,m168,JIM,"You were looking for me, weren't you?"
88196,L462535,u2586,m168,JUDY,It doesn't matter to them.
88197,L462534,u2585,m168,JIM,They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
88198,L462533,u2586,m168,JUDY,They'll be looking for you.
88199,L462134,u2585,m168,JIM,I'm not so bad.
88200,L462133,u2586,m168,JUDY,Goodbye!  See you!
88201,L462132,u2585,m168,JIM,A what?
88202,L462131,u2586,m168,JUDY,I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
88203,L462130,u2585,m168,JIM,Oh.
88204,L462129,u2586,m168,JUDY,The kids take me.
88205,L462127,u2586,m168,JUDY,University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
88206,L462126,u2585,m168,JIM,Yeah.  So where's the high school?
88207,L462125,u2586,m168,JUDY,Dig the square wardrobe!
88208,L462124,u2585,m168,JIM,Yeah--why--
88209,L462123,u2586,m168,JUDY,You going there?
88210,L462122,u2585,m168,JIM,Where's Dawson High School?
88211,L462121,u2585,m168,JIM,You're really flipped--aren't you.
88212,L462120,u2586,m168,JUDY,Won't mother be proud.
88213,L462119,u2585,m168,JIM,"See, I'm new."
88214,L462118,u2586,m168,JUDY,Who lives?
88215,L462117,u2585,m168,JIM,Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
88216,L462116,u2586,m168,JUDY,Where what was.
88217,L462115,u2585,m168,JIM,"""Life can be beautiful."" Hey, I know where it was."
88218,L462114,u2586,m168,JUDY,"""Life is crushing in on me."""
88219,L462113,u2585,m168,JIM,See?
88220,L462112,u2586,m168,JUDY,Now that's true!
88221,L462111,u2585,m168,JIM,You don't have to be unfriendly.
88222,L462110,u2586,m168,JUDY,Bully for you.
88223,L462109,u2585,m168,JIM,Hi.  I saw you before.
88224,L462815,u2592,m168,PLATO,Hi.
88225,L462814,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Hi, Plato!"
88226,L462672,u2586,m168,JUDY,It's all right.
88227,L462671,u2592,m168,PLATO,"I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?"
88228,L462670,u2592,m168,PLATO,He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
88229,L462669,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Plato, where's your father now?"
88230,L462635,u2586,m168,JUDY,Talk to them!  Heavens!
88231,L462634,u2592,m168,PLATO,"Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them."
88232,L462631,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?"
88233,L462630,u2592,m168,PLATO,"Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?"
88234,L462625,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone..."
88235,L462624,u2592,m168,PLATO,Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
88236,L462391,u2592,m168,PLATO,Okay.
88237,L462390,u2586,m168,JUDY,Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
88238,L462389,u2592,m168,PLATO,"Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him ""Jamie."""
88239,L462388,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?"
88240,L462387,u2592,m168,PLATO,"Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere."
88241,L462386,u2586,m168,JUDY,What's he like?
88242,L462385,u2592,m168,PLATO,Yes.  My best friend.
88243,L462384,u2586,m168,JUDY,Is he your friend?
88244,L461964,u2593,m168,RAY,"Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy."
88245,L461963,u2586,m168,JUDY,You said you'd call my father.
88246,L461962,u2593,m168,RAY,She's being called for.
88247,L461961,u2586,m168,JUDY,My mother?
88248,L461960,u2593,m168,RAY,Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
88249,L461959,u2586,m168,JUDY,What?
88250,L461958,u2593,m168,RAY,"Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--"
88251,L461945,u2593,m168,RAY,Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
88252,L461944,u2586,m168,JUDY,You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
88253,L461943,u2593,m168,RAY,"Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy."
88254,L461942,u2586,m168,JUDY,I'll never get close to anybody.
88255,L461941,u2593,m168,RAY,Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
88256,L461940,u2586,m168,JUDY,No.  I don't even know why I do it.
88257,L461939,u2593,m168,RAY,"Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?"
88258,L461938,u2586,m168,JUDY,No.
88259,L461937,u2593,m168,RAY,"You weren't looking for company, were you?"
88260,L461936,u2586,m168,JUDY,I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
88261,L461935,u2593,m168,RAY,Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
88262,L461934,u2586,m168,JUDY,Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
88263,L461933,u2593,m168,RAY,That one?
88264,L461932,u2586,m168,JUDY,Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
88265,L461931,u2593,m168,RAY,Do you think your father means that?
88266,L461930,u2586,m168,JUDY,He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
88267,L461929,u2593,m168,RAY,He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
88268,L461927,u2586,m168,JUDY,I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
88269,L461926,u2593,m168,RAY,"What makes you think he hates you, Judy?"
88270,L461925,u2586,m168,JUDY,He hates me.
88271,L461924,u2593,m168,RAY,What?
88272,L461923,u2586,m168,JUDY,He hates me.
88273,L461922,u2593,m168,RAY,Judy--we're ready for you now.
88274,L462321,u2586,m168,JUDY,Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
88275,L462320,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,"I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?"
88276,L462319,u2586,m168,JUDY,Why?
88277,L462318,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,"I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject."
88278,L462317,u2586,m168,JUDY,I guess I just don't understand anything.
88279,L462315,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
88280,L462314,u2586,m168,JUDY,I was talking to Dad.
88281,L462311,u2586,m168,JUDY,I didn't want to stop.
88282,L462310,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,"You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago."
88283,L462308,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,What?
88284,L462307,u2586,m168,JUDY,Didn't you forget something?
88285,L462306,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,Hi.
88286,L462305,u2586,m168,JUDY,Good evening.
88287,L462304,u2586,m168,JUDY,Daddy--
88288,L462303,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,"With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat."
88289,L462302,u2586,m168,JUDY,"Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change."
88290,L462301,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,No.  Why?
88291,L462300,u2586,m168,JUDY,Are you and Mom home tonight?
88292,L462299,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,We were romantic then too--
88293,L462298,u2586,m168,JUDY,But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
88294,L462297,u2587,m168,JUDY'S FATHER,We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
88295,L462296,u2586,m168,JUDY,How did you know that?
88296,L464267,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
88297,L464266,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Gabriel!
88298,L464254,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree..."
88299,L464253,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you..."
88300,L464252,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,He'll be dead when he does.
88301,L464251,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand."
88302,L464250,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"What, he should see me help you catch him?"
88303,L464249,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
88304,L464248,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
88305,L464247,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"I've been doing good, though."
88306,L464246,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas."
88307,L464245,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
88308,L464244,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love."
88309,L464243,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
88310,L464242,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,-- till he fucked his parole --
88311,L464241,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --"
88312,L464240,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Searching for a money man...
88313,L464239,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,To all those cons...
88314,L464238,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters..."
88315,L464236,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,...whoever she is.
88316,L464235,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"He wants... your ""sister""..."
88317,L464234,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"No, baby. He wants me."
88318,L464233,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,He wants the money.
88319,L463899,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"We're talking, aren't we?"
88320,L463898,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
88321,L463848,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,NO!
88322,L463847,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place."
88323,L463846,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
88324,L463845,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You promised me!
88325,L463844,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!"
88326,L463843,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Gabriel, you promised!"
88327,L463787,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,YES!!!
88328,L463786,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
88329,L463785,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Please, Gabriel, don't..."
88330,L463784,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
88331,L463783,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Don't hurt him...
88332,L463782,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Is this him!?
88333,L463763,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!"
88334,L463762,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,A man of some travels.
88335,L463761,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Gabriel!
88336,L463760,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Read you're a man of some knowledge.
88337,L463759,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,What are you doing here?!
88338,L463758,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Read a lot about you, Nick."
88339,L463757,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Gabriel, let him go --"
88340,L463756,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you."
88341,L463754,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Gabriel, what are you doing!"
88342,L463753,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Must have a way with stationery.
88343,L463752,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Gabriel -- !
88344,L463751,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
88345,L463717,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Thank you.
88346,L463716,u2604,m169,TEEN CLERK,"Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four."
88347,L463715,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?"
88348,L463714,u2604,m169,TEEN CLERK,We sell children's toys --
88349,L463713,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon."
88350,L463712,u2604,m169,TEEN CLERK,Toys for... adults?
88351,L463711,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
88352,L463710,u2604,m169,TEEN CLERK,You can't find... what?
88353,L464430,u2603,m169,RUDY,I never told you my name.
88354,L464429,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You said it a million times!
88355,L464428,u2603,m169,RUDY,But I never said Rudy.
88356,L464427,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
88357,L464426,u2603,m169,RUDY,No --
88358,L464425,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --"
88359,L464424,u2603,m169,RUDY,"You said Merry Christmas, Rudy."
88360,L464423,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,What are you talking about?
88361,L464422,u2603,m169,RUDY,Rudy. How'd you know my name?
88362,L464421,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,What?
88363,L464417,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Merry Christmas.
88364,L464416,u2603,m169,RUDY,I'm glad it was me.
88365,L464415,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Merry Christmas, Rudy."
88366,L464413,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Who wouldn't.
88367,L464412,u2603,m169,RUDY,"He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you."
88368,L464411,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You shouldn't have.
88369,L464410,u2603,m169,RUDY,I saved your life.
88370,L464385,u2603,m169,RUDY,We still gonna spend Christmas together?
88371,L464384,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You... you... YOU --
88372,L464360,u2603,m169,RUDY,Yeah. That's love.
88373,L464359,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!"
88374,L464281,u2603,m169,RUDY,Well. I'm going home.
88375,L464280,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?"
88376,L464279,u2603,m169,RUDY,I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
88377,L464228,u2603,m169,RUDY,Keep 'em there for a little while.
88378,L464227,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,They all are. Football's on.
88379,L464226,u2603,m169,RUDY,Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
88380,L464225,u2603,m169,RUDY,"We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun..."
88381,L464224,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,No.
88382,L464223,u2603,m169,RUDY,Is there any way you could get into his truck?
88383,L464222,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it."
88384,L464221,u2603,m169,RUDY,You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
88385,L464220,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"How are we gonna do this, Nick?"
88386,L464219,u2603,m169,RUDY,"If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here."
88387,L464218,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,He says he wants it now.
88388,L464217,u2603,m169,RUDY,I'm almost done.
88389,L464216,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,He wants to see your map.
88390,L464162,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Part of... with them?
88391,L464161,u2603,m169,RUDY,We need to find a way to make me part of it.
88392,L464160,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, what are you talking about?"
88393,L464159,u2603,m169,RUDY,I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
88394,L464158,u2603,m169,RUDY,We'll need one.
88395,L464157,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,I don't know...
88396,L464156,u2603,m169,RUDY,"You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns."
88397,L464155,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,What?
88398,L464154,u2603,m169,RUDY,They'll have guns.
88399,L464152,u2603,m169,RUDY,Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
88400,L464151,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I love you, Nick..."
88401,L464150,u2603,m169,RUDY,Don't say my name...
88402,L464149,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry..."
88403,L464146,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?"
88404,L464145,u2603,m169,RUDY,You saved me.
88405,L464144,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me."
88406,L464143,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years."
88407,L464142,u2603,m169,RUDY,...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
88408,L464141,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"We'll get there, baby... we'll get there..."
88409,L464140,u2603,m169,RUDY,"All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns..."
88410,L464139,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --"
88411,L464102,u2603,m169,RUDY,Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
88412,L464101,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, the ice is --"
88413,L464100,u2603,m169,RUDY,"We get to the bridge, we're all right!"
88414,L464066,u2603,m169,RUDY,"There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me."
88415,L464065,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, what happened --"
88416,L464041,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike."
88417,L464040,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,That guy knows you?
88418,L464039,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now."
88419,L464038,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,So does it look a lot different?
88420,L463987,u2603,m169,RUDY,Get your own room.
88421,L463986,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Nick...
88422,L463985,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Get your own room, Ashley."
88423,L463984,u2603,m169,RUDY,"We? What ""we""..."
88424,L463983,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this..."
88425,L463982,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me..."
88426,L463981,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,They're truck drivers.
88427,L463980,u2603,m169,RUDY,They've never done a robbery?
88428,L463978,u2603,m169,RUDY,Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
88429,L463977,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,What?
88430,L463976,u2603,m169,RUDY,And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
88431,L463975,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
88432,L463974,u2603,m169,RUDY,He working for them on this one?
88433,L463973,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads."
88434,L463972,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?"
88435,L463971,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Not without you.
88436,L463970,u2603,m169,RUDY,"So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?"
88437,L463969,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how..."
88438,L463968,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --"
88439,L463967,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,No!
88440,L463966,u2603,m169,RUDY,"For what? You to talk me into ""helping""? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?"
88441,L463965,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,I thought we'd have a few more days.
88442,L463964,u2603,m169,RUDY,"But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya."
88443,L463963,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said ""when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him."" I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --"
88444,L463939,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?"
88445,L463938,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Jack. Jack Bangs.
88446,L463937,u2603,m169,RUDY,"They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--"
88447,L463880,u2603,m169,RUDY,Canada.
88448,L463879,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Gabriel!
88449,L463835,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!"
88450,L463834,u2603,m169,RUDY,...maybe I die for Nick...
88451,L463833,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
88452,L463832,u2603,m169,RUDY,Nick died for me....
88453,L463831,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!"
88454,L463830,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Your pen palls dead, lady."
88455,L463828,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,I love you!
88456,L463827,u2603,m169,RUDY,You're in on this.
88457,L463826,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"No, Nick, no --"
88458,L463825,u2603,m169,RUDY,You told him about Nick's letters.
88459,L463824,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, please, it's me --"
88460,L463823,u2603,m169,RUDY,"He didn't ""find"" Nick's letters, did he."
88461,L463822,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead."
88462,L463821,u2603,m169,RUDY,You're not hearing me here --
88463,L463820,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,He'll kill you.
88464,L463819,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, it won't work. It won't work!"
88465,L463818,u2603,m169,RUDY,Get the hell off of me!
88466,L463815,u2603,m169,RUDY,JESUS CHRIST!
88467,L463814,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, I love you --"
88468,L463813,u2603,m169,RUDY,I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
88469,L463812,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, what are you --"
88470,L463811,u2603,m169,RUDY,"When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!"
88471,L463810,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Nick --
88472,L463809,u2603,m169,RUDY,You sold him out.
88473,L463808,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Nick, no --"
88474,L463807,u2603,m169,RUDY,You motherfucker.
88475,L463805,u2603,m169,RUDY,What's going ON!!!
88476,L463804,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters."
88477,L463803,u2603,m169,RUDY,What the fuck is going on.
88478,L463802,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --"
88479,L463800,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not..."
88480,L463799,u2603,m169,RUDY,...the truck driver...
88481,L463798,u2603,m169,RUDY,Your brother...
88482,L463797,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore."
88483,L463766,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Nick...
88484,L463765,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy."
88485,L463747,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,NICK!
88486,L463746,u2603,m169,RUDY,NO!
88487,L463731,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"No, lover. I'll see what you can do."
88488,L463730,u2603,m169,RUDY,I'll see what I can do.
88489,L463729,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane."
88490,L463725,u2603,m169,RUDY,Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
88491,L463724,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,We could live it up and --
88492,L463723,u2603,m169,RUDY,We'll have more fun in Detroit.
88493,L463722,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?"
88494,L463721,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --"
88495,L463720,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?"
88496,L463719,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Well, I don't know about that --"
88497,L463708,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho."
88498,L463707,u2603,m169,RUDY,Beauty and fragrances.
88499,L463706,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You forget where I work?
88500,L463704,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas."
88501,L463703,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --"
88502,L463702,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
88503,L463701,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Ash, you've gotten me enough --"
88504,L463700,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You need a COAT!
88505,L463699,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies."
88506,L463698,u2603,m169,RUDY,Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
88507,L463697,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!"
88508,L463696,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Ashley, Jesus --"
88509,L463693,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
88510,L463692,u2603,m169,RUDY,Where the hell are you going?
88511,L463690,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Then he shoulda signed his name.
88512,L463689,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too..."
88513,L463688,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words."
88514,L463687,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --"
88515,L463686,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Yes it was all you --
88516,L463685,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Well, wasn't all me, y'know."
88517,L463684,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things."
88518,L463683,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Had some bad relationships, didn't you."
88519,L463682,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way."
88520,L463681,u2603,m169,RUDY,Tell me again.
88521,L463680,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"I told you, Nick. Remember?"
88522,L463679,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?"
88523,L463678,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
88524,L463677,u2603,m169,RUDY,"No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth."
88525,L463676,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --"
88526,L463675,u2603,m169,RUDY,Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
88527,L463673,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time."
88528,L463672,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"No, c'mon --"
88529,L463671,u2603,m169,RUDY,One more. Smile. One more.
88530,L463670,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,No --
88531,L463669,u2603,m169,RUDY,Smile.
88532,L463668,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,What.
88533,L463667,u2603,m169,RUDY,Do that again.
88534,L463666,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"No, no, no. Be like you want to be."
88535,L463665,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --"
88536,L463664,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
88537,L463663,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,You are to me.
88538,L463662,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here."
88539,L463661,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Saw me --
88540,L463660,u2603,m169,RUDY,"No, hey, I like your coat --"
88541,L463659,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,"Saw my outfit or something, my coat --"
88542,L463658,u2603,m169,RUDY,"No, no --"
88543,L463657,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
88544,L463654,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Radio said.
88545,L463653,u2603,m169,RUDY,I don't think it's negative five.
88546,L463652,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Yeah.
88547,L463651,u2603,m169,RUDY,Negative five?
88548,L463650,u2595,m169,ASHLEY,Radio said negative five.
88549,L463649,u2603,m169,RUDY,Gotta be ten degrees out there.
88550,L464434,u2603,m169,RUDY,How'd you know my name.
88551,L464433,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Ash?
88552,L464432,u2603,m169,RUDY,How'd you know my name was Rudy.
88553,L464431,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Ash?
88554,L464420,u2603,m169,RUDY,How'd you know my name...
88555,L464419,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Get in the CAR!
88556,L464407,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers."
88557,L464406,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End."
88558,L464387,u2603,m169,RUDY,Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
88559,L464386,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --"
88560,L464214,u2603,m169,RUDY,"What, we walking in there and delivering toys?"
88561,L464213,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Can't be attracting attention, right?"
88562,L464212,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"'Tis the season, convict."
88563,L464211,u2603,m169,RUDY,You gotta be kidding me.
88564,L464209,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys."
88565,L464208,u2603,m169,RUDY,What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
88566,L464207,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters."
88567,L464206,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it."
88568,L464205,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,No gun.
88569,L464203,u2603,m169,RUDY,"There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat."
88570,L464202,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"No, you're not."
88571,L464201,u2603,m169,RUDY,I'm no threat without a gun.
88572,L464200,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,No way.
88573,L464199,u2603,m169,RUDY,Six men means six guns.
88574,L464198,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing."
88575,L464196,u2603,m169,RUDY,"You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it."
88576,L464195,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,No.
88577,L464194,u2603,m169,RUDY,"You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me."
88578,L464193,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,NO.
88579,L464192,u2603,m169,RUDY,You need six.
88580,L464191,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
88581,L464190,u2603,m169,RUDY,"So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six."
88582,L464181,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out."
88583,L464180,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What's the code?
88584,L464179,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access."
88585,L464174,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Sing it in pictures, Nick."
88586,L464173,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum"
88587,L464172,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Start singing.
88588,L464131,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Nick. I been trying to hit you.
88589,L464130,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me..."
88590,L464127,u2603,m169,RUDY,"No, Gabriel... no..."
88591,L464126,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?"
88592,L464123,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else..."
88593,L464122,u2603,m169,RUDY,He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
88594,L464121,u2603,m169,RUDY,NO!
88595,L464120,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
88596,L464119,u2603,m169,RUDY,Nothing... I promise-nothing...
88597,L464118,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
88598,L464117,u2603,m169,RUDY,Nnn... nothing...
88599,L464116,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What'd you tell that casino manager?
88600,L464115,u2603,m169,RUDY,...ttt..tt... two out of three?
88601,L464114,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Got something to say to me, Nick?"
88602,L464110,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest."
88603,L464109,u2603,m169,RUDY,...never... tried...
88604,L464108,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain."
88605,L464013,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred."
88606,L464012,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Don't tip.
88607,L464011,u2603,m169,RUDY,Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
88608,L464010,u2603,m169,RUDY,I'm gonna need some money.
88609,L464009,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,You got one hour.
88610,L464007,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Get out.
88611,L464006,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --"
88612,L464005,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral."
88613,L464004,u2603,m169,RUDY,Do I get a country-western name?
88614,L464003,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place."
88615,L464002,u2603,m169,RUDY,At least gimme video poker.
88616,L464001,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,You do.
88617,L464000,u2603,m169,RUDY,What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
88618,L463999,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps."
88619,L463998,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Put it on.
88620,L463997,u2603,m169,RUDY,A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
88621,L463960,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick."
88622,L463959,u2603,m169,RUDY,Might as well be.
88623,L463958,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Rather be back in the Mountain?
88624,L463956,u2603,m169,RUDY,More than you know.
88625,L463955,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Bring back some memories, Nick?"
88626,L463953,u2603,m169,RUDY,'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
88627,L463952,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
88628,L463951,u2603,m169,RUDY,Trust me. They won't recognize me.
88629,L463950,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Why not.
88630,L463949,u2603,m169,RUDY,They won't recognize me.
88631,L463946,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you."
88632,L463945,u2603,m169,RUDY,"You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map."
88633,L463944,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,So what the hell good are you...
88634,L463941,u2603,m169,RUDY,"When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe."
88635,L463940,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
88636,L463933,u2603,m169,RUDY,And I worked there. For a year.
88637,L463932,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,We walked the place for a week.
88638,L463927,u2603,m169,RUDY,"This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --"
88639,L463926,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What the fuck are you talking about.
88640,L463925,u2603,m169,RUDY,This isn't the Tomahawk.
88641,L463924,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,I did.
88642,L463923,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I said, who the hell made the map?"
88643,L463922,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What?
88644,L463918,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
88645,L463917,u2603,m169,RUDY,Hell. Ten?
88646,L463908,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man."
88647,L463907,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Hey, it's... been two years --"
88648,L463906,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how."
88649,L463905,u2603,m169,RUDY,Christmas... Eve...
88650,L463904,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?"
88651,L463903,u2603,m169,RUDY,Five million?
88652,L463902,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,The hell you don't.
88653,L463901,u2603,m169,RUDY,I don't know.
88654,L463900,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
88655,L463896,u2603,m169,RUDY,Hey.
88656,L463895,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,You knew the place --
88657,L463889,u2603,m169,RUDY,Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
88658,L463888,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --"
88659,L463886,u2603,m169,RUDY,No. It's her brother.
88660,L463885,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Wrong, Nick. It's drowning."
88661,L463884,u2603,m169,RUDY,Her brother.
88662,L463883,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What's her greatest fear?
88663,L463882,u2603,m169,RUDY,A station wagon in Canada.
88664,L463881,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Be more specific.
88665,L463878,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Where'd she drop her cherry?
88666,L463877,u2603,m169,RUDY,What college.
88667,L463876,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What'd they call her in college?
88668,L463875,u2603,m169,RUDY,Bam Bam.
88669,L463874,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What'd they call her in high school?
88670,L463873,u2603,m169,RUDY,Samantha.
88671,L463872,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,What's her middle name?
88672,L463871,u2603,m169,RUDY,J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
88673,L463870,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?"
88674,L463869,u2603,m169,RUDY,What?
88675,L463868,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Where's she work?
88676,L463864,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig."
88677,L463863,u2603,m169,RUDY,I had better sex in prison.
88678,L463862,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"A girl says she loves you, you say something."
88679,L463861,u2603,m169,RUDY,Wish I had a brother like you.
88680,L463860,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart."
88681,L463859,u2603,m169,RUDY,She says a lot of things.
88682,L463858,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Hey. She says she loves you, Nick."
88683,L463839,u2603,m169,RUDY,I never worked at no casino.
88684,L463838,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus."
88685,L463781,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
88686,L463780,u2603,m169,RUDY,Yes!
88687,L463779,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,So you could get down her chimney.
88688,L463778,u2603,m169,RUDY,Yes!
88689,L463777,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,So you could get with my sister.
88690,L463776,u2603,m169,RUDY,Yes!
88691,L463775,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,But you were saying you were...
88692,L463774,u2603,m169,RUDY,I shared his cell!
88693,L463773,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,You're not Nick Mason...
88694,L463772,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --"
88695,L463771,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,You what...
88696,L463770,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!"
88697,L463769,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Put him in the truck.
88698,L463768,u2603,m169,RUDY,"You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!"
88699,L463767,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Who are you now.
88700,L463742,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,The hell I can't.
88701,L463741,u2603,m169,RUDY,"No, you can't --"
88702,L463740,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well."
88703,L463739,u2603,m169,RUDY,You... you don't know me --
88704,L464088,u2599,m169,MERLIN,Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
88705,L464087,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Where the HELL did he go?
88706,L464018,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
88707,L464017,u2599,m169,MERLIN,"Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel..."
88708,L463915,u2599,m169,MERLIN,And where they hide the real money.
88709,L463914,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,"Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it."
88710,L463792,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Leave the tree.
88711,L463791,u2599,m169,MERLIN,How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
88712,L463790,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Take 'em.

88718,L464380,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,He's not Nick Mason...
88719,L464379,u2596,m169,GABRIEL,Where is he?! Where is he?!

88728,L464350,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,"Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me..."
88729,L464035,u2606,m169,YOUNG GOVERNOR,"We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community."
88730,L464034,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,"I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!"
88731,L464033,u2606,m169,YOUNG GOVERNOR,The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
88732,L464032,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,"Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody."
88733,L464031,u2606,m169,YOUNG GOVERNOR,Mr. Bangs.
88734,L464030,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,"I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything."
88735,L464024,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,"Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow."
88736,L464023,u2606,m169,YOUNG GOVERNOR,We're aware of your position.
88737,L464022,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
88738,L464021,u2606,m169,YOUNG GOVERNOR,"We understand you, Mr. Bangs."
88739,L464020,u2597,m169,JACK BANGS,"There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?"
88740,L464293,u2603,m169,RUDY,"We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!"
88741,L464292,u2598,m169,JUMPY,"Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season..."
88742,L464189,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe."
88743,L464188,u2598,m169,JUMPY,The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
88744,L464187,u2603,m169,RUDY,What?
88745,L464186,u2598,m169,JUMPY,What about the Powwow Safe?
88746,L463943,u2603,m169,RUDY,"His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed."
88747,L463942,u2598,m169,JUMPY,The Powwow Safe?
88748,L464277,u2599,m169,MERLIN,Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
88749,L464276,u2602,m169,PUG,I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --

88751,L464170,u2599,m169,MERLIN,His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
88752,L464169,u2602,m169,PUG,"My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers."
88753,L464168,u2599,m169,MERLIN,"This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down."
88754,L464166,u2599,m169,MERLIN,"That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?"
88755,L464165,u2602,m169,PUG,"Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray."
88756,L464090,u2599,m169,MERLIN,And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
88757,L464089,u2602,m169,PUG,That motherfucker --
88758,L463995,u2599,m169,MERLIN,Acid-chewer.
88759,L463994,u2602,m169,PUG,Cancer-sucker.
88760,L463993,u2599,m169,MERLIN,There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
88761,L463992,u2602,m169,PUG,"Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?"
88762,L464078,u2599,m169,MERLIN,"No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around."
88763,L464077,u2605,m169,WAITRESS,My what?!
88764,L464076,u2599,m169,MERLIN,How long ago was your makeover?
88765,L464075,u2605,m169,WAITRESS,Five years. Since it opened.
88766,L464074,u2599,m169,MERLIN,Hell yeah. You work here long?
88767,L464073,u2605,m169,WAITRESS,Fuckin' freezing.
88768,L464072,u2599,m169,MERLIN,"Thanks, sister. How are ya."
88769,L464365,u2603,m169,RUDY,"I promise you, I didn't know!"
88770,L464364,u2599,m169,MERLIN,You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
88771,L464363,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Merlin, I didn't know --"
88772,L464362,u2599,m169,MERLIN,You knew there were guns in here!
88773,L464345,u2603,m169,RUDY,DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
88774,L464344,u2599,m169,MERLIN,"DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!"
88775,L464256,u2599,m169,MERLIN,Where the hell's Gabriel?
88776,L464255,u2603,m169,RUDY,"Here's my present to you, truck drivers --"
88777,L464185,u2603,m169,RUDY,"You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms."
88778,L464184,u2599,m169,MERLIN,What about the money?

So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin ""what the fuck."" And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back.

88932,L465737,u2620,m170,VIC,"No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says ""Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up."" And I say ""Well, Joe, I coulda told you that."" ""I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! ""  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself."

88947,L465934,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Where was she from, Compton?"
88948,L465933,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E."
88949,L465932,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Elois?
88950,L465931,u2609,m170,EDDIE,Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
88951,L465797,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?"
88952,L465796,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Who?
88953,L465795,u2609,m170,EDDIE,I'll call somebody.
88954,L465794,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"You ain't dying, he is."
88955,L465793,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know."
88956,L465778,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of."
88957,L465777,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!"
88958,L466004,u2612,m170,JOE,"That's okay, Eddie, I do."
88959,L466003,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening."
88960,L465768,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him."
88961,L465767,u2612,m170,JOE,"Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya."
88962,L465766,u2609,m170,EDDIE,Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
88963,L465763,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on."
88964,L465762,u2612,m170,JOE,Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
88965,L465759,u2609,m170,EDDIE,This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
88966,L465758,u2612,m170,JOE,"We can work this out, can't we?"
88967,L465752,u2609,m170,EDDIE,Really? Who's your P.O.?
88968,L465751,u2612,m170,JOE,"Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem."
88969,L465743,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me."
88970,L465742,u2612,m170,JOE,What?
88971,L465741,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Daddy, did ya see that?"
88972,L465997,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?"
88973,L465996,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"He's right about the ear, it's hacked off."
88974,L465942,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him ""Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her."
88975,L465941,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now."
88976,L465940,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier."
88977,L465939,u2609,m170,EDDIE,Pam Grier.
88978,L465938,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
88979,L465937,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show ""Get Christie Love""? She was a black female cop. She always used to say ""You're under arrest, sugar."""
88980,L465936,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  ""Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."""
88981,L465926,u2609,m170,EDDIE,I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
88982,L465925,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up."
88983,L465818,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you."
88984,L465817,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
88985,L465816,u2609,m170,EDDIE,What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
88986,L465805,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend."
88987,L465804,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
88988,L465803,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them."
88989,L465802,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
88990,L465801,u2609,m170,EDDIE,I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
88991,L465799,u2609,m170,EDDIE,Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
88992,L465798,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue."
88993,L465788,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up."
88994,L465787,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I don't know, but somebody did."
88995,L465786,u2609,m170,EDDIE,And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
88996,L465785,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
88997,L465784,u2609,m170,EDDIE,"Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?"
88998,L465783,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out."
88999,L465782,u2609,m170,EDDIE,Bullshit.
89000,L465781,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,The cops were there waitin' for us!
89001,L465780,u2609,m170,EDDIE,What? Nobody set anybody up.
89002,L465779,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"We were set up, the cops were waiting for us."
89003,L465909,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy."
89004,L465908,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,Tell me more about Cabot.
89005,L465887,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,"The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you."
89006,L465886,u2610,m170,FREDDY,I can do that.
89007,L465885,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,"It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it."
89008,L465884,u2610,m170,FREDDY,I gotta memorize all this shit?
89009,L465883,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
89010,L465882,u2610,m170,FREDDY,What?
89011,L465881,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
89012,L465880,u2610,m170,FREDDY,But what is this?
89013,L465879,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,"A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job."
89014,L465878,u2610,m170,FREDDY,What?
89015,L465877,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,It's a scene. Memorize it.
89016,L465876,u2610,m170,FREDDY,What's this?
89017,L465875,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too."
89018,L465874,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,Didja use the commode story?
89019,L465872,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that."
89020,L465871,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
89021,L465870,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,"Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face."
89022,L465869,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em."
89023,L465868,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,The Milwaukee Brewers?
89024,L465867,u2610,m170,FREDDY,The Brewers.
89025,L465866,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,What about?
89026,L465865,u2610,m170,FREDDY,A little.
89027,L465864,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,Yeah.
89028,L465863,u2610,m170,FREDDY,Me and Mr. White?
89029,L465862,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,Did the two of you talk?
89030,L465861,u2610,m170,FREDDY,The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
89031,L465860,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,How can you tell?
89032,L465859,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well."
89033,L465858,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,Yeah.
89034,L465857,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"Who, Mr. White?"
89035,L465856,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,You ever seen this motherfucker before?
89036,L465855,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange."
89037,L465854,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,...What bar?
89038,L465853,u2610,m170,FREDDY,Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
89039,L465848,u2611,m170,HOLDAWAY,This better not be some Freddy joke.
89040,L465847,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"Say ""hello"" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?"
89041,L465985,u2610,m170,FREDDY,I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
89042,L465984,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Just hold on buddy boy.
89043,L465981,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What? Snap out of it!
89044,L465980,u2610,m170,FREDDY,I'm sorry.
89045,L465974,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco."
89046,L465973,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?"
89047,L465972,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Myself and Mr. Pink?
89048,L465971,u2610,m170,FREDDY,Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
89049,L465970,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
89050,L465969,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store."
89051,L465968,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Mr. Brown?
89052,L465967,u2610,m170,FREDDY,I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
89053,L465966,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Let's go over it. Where are you?
89054,L465947,u2610,m170,FREDDY,You can do some crazy things with it.
89055,L465946,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Jesus Christ!
89056,L465892,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station."
89057,L465891,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What for?
89058,L465890,u2610,m170,FREDDY,"...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly."
89059,L465765,u2612,m170,JOE,"Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -"
89060,L465764,u2620,m170,VIC,"That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?"
89061,L465729,u2620,m170,VIC,"Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again."
89062,L465728,u2612,m170,JOE,It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
89063,L465727,u2620,m170,VIC,"I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot."
89064,L465726,u2612,m170,JOE,What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
89065,L465725,u2620,m170,VIC,"I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside."
89066,L465724,u2612,m170,JOE,"Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick."
89067,L465723,u2620,m170,VIC,"Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house."
89068,L465722,u2612,m170,JOE,How is he?
89069,L465721,u2620,m170,VIC,A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
89070,L465720,u2612,m170,JOE,Who's your parole officer?
89071,L465719,u2612,m170,JOE,Take a seat.
89072,L465718,u2620,m170,VIC,Sure.
89073,L465717,u2612,m170,JOE,Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
89074,L465716,u2620,m170,VIC,It's a change.
89075,L465715,u2612,m170,JOE,"How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?"
89076,L465418,u2612,m170,JOE,"Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?"
89077,L465417,u2615,m170,MR. BROWN,"Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale."
89078,L465416,u2612,m170,JOE,Wong?
89079,L465415,u2615,m170,MR. BROWN,"It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, ""Like a Virgin."""
89080,L465414,u2612,m170,JOE,Chew? Toby Chew? No.
89081,L465413,u2615,m170,MR. BROWN,"Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in ""The Great Escape."" He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain."
89082,L465405,u2612,m170,JOE,"Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl."
89083,L465404,u2615,m170,MR. BROWN,"Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought."
89084,L465398,u2615,m170,MR. BROWN,"It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what ""True Blue"" is about, no argument about that."
89085,L465397,u2612,m170,JOE,Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
89086,L466016,u2612,m170,JOE,Dead as Dillinger.
89087,L466015,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Mr. Blue's dead?
89088,L465964,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on."
89089,L465963,u2612,m170,JOE,"Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?"
89090,L465960,u2612,m170,JOE,"You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink."
89091,L465959,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple."
89092,L465957,u2612,m170,JOE,"I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow."
89093,L465956,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Why can't we pick out our own colors?
89094,L465955,u2612,m170,JOE,"Cause you're a faggot, alright?"
89095,L465954,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Why am I Mr. Pink?
89096,L465953,u2612,m170,JOE,"But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink."
89097,L465495,u2612,m170,JOE,"Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants."
89098,L465494,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't."
89099,L466032,u2612,m170,JOE,"I'm not askin', I'm betting."
89100,L466031,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Don't ask me that.
89101,L466030,u2612,m170,JOE,"Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this."
89102,L466029,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!"
89103,L466028,u2612,m170,JOE,"Larry, I'm gonna kill him."
89104,L466026,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!"
89105,L466025,u2612,m170,JOE,"Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much."
89106,L466021,u2612,m170,JOE,"You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more."
89107,L466020,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,That's your proof?
89108,L466019,u2612,m170,JOE,"He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up."
89109,L466014,u2612,m170,JOE,You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
89110,L466013,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that."
89111,L466012,u2612,m170,JOE,Like hell I am.
89112,L466011,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong."
89113,L466006,u2612,m170,JOE,That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
89114,L466005,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What the fuck are you talking about?
89115,L465615,u2612,m170,JOE,"Juicy, junior, real juicy."
89116,L465614,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"What's the cut, poppa?"
89117,L465613,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"No, they're not."
89118,L465612,u2612,m170,JOE,Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
89119,L465611,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,How many employees?
89120,L465610,u2612,m170,JOE,"Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd."
89121,L465609,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
89122,L465608,u2612,m170,JOE,What for?
89123,L465607,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
89124,L465606,u2612,m170,JOE,"Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?"
89125,L465605,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
89126,L465604,u2612,m170,JOE,Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
89127,L465603,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram."
89128,L465602,u2612,m170,JOE,What's she doin' now?
89129,L465450,u2612,m170,JOE,"Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?"
89130,L465449,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Sorry, it's my book now."
89131,L465448,u2612,m170,JOE,"I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back."
89132,L465442,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Who gives a damn?
89133,L465441,u2612,m170,JOE,"No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too."
89134,L465429,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it."
89135,L465428,u2612,m170,JOE,I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
89136,L465427,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,You gonna put it away?
89137,L465426,u2612,m170,JOE,Give me my book.
89138,L465425,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot."
89139,L465424,u2612,m170,JOE,What do you care?
89140,L465423,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. ""Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan."" I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left."
89141,L465422,u2612,m170,JOE,"Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now."
89142,L465421,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
89143,L465420,u2612,m170,JOE,What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
89144,L465419,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Give me this fucking thing.
89145,L465407,u2612,m170,JOE,I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
89146,L465406,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What's that?
89147,L466010,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
89148,L466009,u2612,m170,JOE,Aren't you?
89149,L465493,u2612,m170,JOE,"Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast."
89150,L465492,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,Nope.
89151,L465491,u2612,m170,JOE,He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
89152,L465490,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,He don't believe in it.
89153,L465489,u2612,m170,JOE,He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
89154,L465488,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,He don't tip.
89155,L465487,u2612,m170,JOE,Mr. Pink?  Why?
89156,L465486,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,Mr. Pink.
89157,L465485,u2612,m170,JOE,"Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?"
89158,L465846,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door."
89159,L465845,u2613,m170,MARVIN,What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
89160,L465844,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away."
89161,L465843,u2613,m170,MARVIN,That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
89162,L465841,u2613,m170,MARVIN,I do.  How do I look?
89163,L465840,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,Shit. I don't remember that at all.
89164,L465839,u2613,m170,MARVIN,"Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago."
89165,L465838,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,Freddy Newendyke.
89166,L465837,u2613,m170,MARVIN,Your name's Freddy something.
89167,L465836,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,You do?
89168,L465835,u2613,m170,MARVIN,I know.
89169,L465815,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,I don't like alarms.
89170,L465814,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
89171,L465813,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive."
89172,L465810,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him."
89173,L465809,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming ""You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."""
89174,L465808,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard."
89175,L465708,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you."
89176,L465707,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
89177,L465706,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,You didn't ask.
89178,L465705,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
89179,L465702,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,Nice Guy Eddie.
89180,L465701,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"For what, the cops?"
89181,L465698,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,It's a surprise.
89182,L465697,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Why?
89183,L465696,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,Down to my car.
89184,L465695,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Follow you where?
89185,L465686,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"I said: ""Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."""
89186,L465685,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?"
89187,L465684,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?"
89188,L465683,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you."
89189,L465682,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got."
89190,L465681,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
89191,L465680,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,What're you talkin' about?
89192,L465679,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!"
89193,L465678,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,What's this guy's problem?
89194,L465668,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,We think we got a rat in the house.
89195,L465667,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"So, talk."
89196,L465431,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize."
89197,L465430,u2614,m170,MR. BLONDE,"Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?"
89198,L465993,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up."
89199,L465992,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho."
89200,L465988,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive."
89201,L465987,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What happened?
89202,L465521,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor."
89203,L465520,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Lie back down, and try to -"
89204,L465519,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe."
89205,L465518,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,I can' take you to a hospital.
89206,L465517,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die."
89207,L465516,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,It's not good...
89208,L465515,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad."
89209,L465514,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"You're not gonna fucking die, all right?"
89210,L465513,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die."
89211,L465511,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me."
89212,L465510,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
89213,L465508,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Bet your sweet ass we are.
89214,L465507,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,Joe.
89215,L465506,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?"
89216,L465505,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Correct.
89217,L465504,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,I'm okay.
89218,L465503,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
89219,L465501,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"No, I'm not!"
89220,L465500,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?"
89221,L465499,u2616,m170,MR. ORANGE,"All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it."
89222,L465498,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying."
89223,L465471,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,"Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -"
89224,L465470,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy."
89225,L465466,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times."
89226,L465465,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,I'd go over twelve percent for that.
89227,L465461,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job."
89228,L465460,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
89229,L465456,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,You don't believe in tipping?
89230,L465455,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,I don't believe in it.
89231,L465454,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
89232,L465453,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Uh-uh. I don't tip.
89233,L465452,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,"C'mon, throw in a buck."
89234,L465436,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,"When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And ""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia"" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy."
89235,L465435,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? ""Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat,"" by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade."
89236,L465434,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
89237,L465433,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?"
89238,L465432,u2619,m170,NICE GUY EDDIE,Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
89239,L465962,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think ""Mr. Pink"" is no big deal, you wanna trade?"
89240,L465961,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss..."
89241,L465930,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Yeah, those guys too."
89242,L465929,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Not these guys.
89243,L465928,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out."
89244,L465927,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?"
89245,L465924,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,There's a slight difference.
89246,L465923,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women."
89247,L465812,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,This is what he was doin'.
89248,L465811,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store."
89249,L465792,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What are you gonna do about him?
89250,L465791,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,I told ya he'd be pissed.
89251,L465693,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
89252,L465692,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,You takin' his side?
89253,L465691,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops."
89254,L465690,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out."
89255,L465689,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another."
89256,L465688,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"So you wanna git bit, huh?"
89257,L465687,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
89258,L465673,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us."
89259,L465672,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,We don't think this place is safe.
89260,L465671,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Is that supposed to be funny?
89261,L465666,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip."
89262,L465665,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long."
89263,L465655,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror."
89264,L465654,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!"
89265,L465651,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,That fuckin did it!
89266,L465650,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't."
89267,L465649,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"If we don't, he'll die."
89268,L465648,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,We ain't taking him to a hospital.
89269,L465647,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round."
89270,L465646,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?"
89271,L465645,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Of course.
89272,L465644,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?"
89273,L465643,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Don't fuckin' patronize me.
89274,L465642,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -"
89275,L465641,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, ""Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough.""? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't."
89276,L465640,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,He asked.
89277,L465639,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
89278,L465638,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
89279,L465637,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Why!
89280,L465636,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"I told him my first name, and where I'm from."
89281,L465635,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"You didn't tell him your name, did ya?"
89282,L465634,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Well, he knows a little about me."
89283,L465633,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision."
89284,L465632,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,I don't know anybody.
89285,L465631,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em."
89286,L465630,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here."
89287,L465629,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible."
89288,L465628,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him."
89289,L465627,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"You gotta idea, spit it out."
89290,L465626,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain."
89291,L465625,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up."
89292,L465624,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die."
89293,L465623,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,We can't take him to a hospital.
89294,L465622,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital."
89295,L465621,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
89296,L465620,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,I think he's just passed out.
89297,L465619,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,So what is it?
89298,L465618,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,He ain't dead.
89299,L465617,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"So, is he dead or what?"
89300,L465597,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right."
89301,L465596,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?"
89302,L465595,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?"
89303,L465594,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
89304,L465593,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat."
89305,L465592,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"For all I know, you're the rat."
89306,L465591,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat."
89307,L465590,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit."
89308,L465589,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up."
89309,L465588,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it."
89310,L465587,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,No shit?
89311,L465586,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop."
89312,L465585,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,What?
89313,L465584,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
89314,L465583,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute."
89315,L465582,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"That was the plan, we meet here."
89316,L465581,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here."
89317,L465580,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Where? Are they out in the car?
89318,L465579,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I got 'em, all right?"
89319,L465578,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Where?
89320,L465577,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,I got the diamonds.
89321,L465576,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,How can you be so sure?
89322,L465575,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Nope.
89323,L465574,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -"
89324,L465573,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?"
89325,L465572,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
89326,L465571,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em."
89327,L465570,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What do you think?
89328,L465569,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back."
89329,L465568,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down."
89330,L465567,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
89331,L465566,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?"
89332,L465565,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody."
89333,L465564,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?"
89334,L465563,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way."
89335,L465562,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
89336,L465561,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
89337,L465560,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Uh-uh, just cops."
89338,L465559,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,No real people?
89339,L465558,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,A few cops.
89340,L465557,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
89341,L465554,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there."
89342,L465553,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?"
89343,L465552,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine."
89344,L465551,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Look, enough of this ""Mr White"" shit -"
89345,L465550,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?"
89346,L465549,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops."
89347,L465548,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
89348,L465547,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,What's wrong with it?
89349,L465546,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,That's not correct.
89350,L465545,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -"
89351,L465544,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Why not?
89352,L465543,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Want a smoke?
89353,L465541,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
89354,L465540,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,I'm cool.
89355,L465539,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?"
89356,L465538,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said ""No thank you"", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!"
89357,L465537,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Let's go in the other room...
89358,L465536,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now."
89359,L465535,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him."
89360,L465534,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?"
89361,L465533,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,You really think we were set up?
89362,L465532,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
89363,L465531,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,As opposed to good?
89364,L465530,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?"
89365,L465529,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
89366,L465528,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?"
89367,L465527,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Dead.
89368,L465526,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
89369,L465525,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,Gun shot.
89370,L465482,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,Fuck all that.
89371,L465481,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,"Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips."
89372,L465477,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit."
89373,L465476,u2618,m170,MR. WHITE,You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
89374,L465475,u2617,m170,MR. PINK,"Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses."
89375,L474666,u2625,m171,GARDNER,"Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov."
89376,L474665,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Look of things, she doesn't."
89377,L474664,u2625,m171,GARDNER,All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
89378,L474663,u2621,m171,CLAY,I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
89379,L474662,u2625,m171,GARDNER,What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
89380,L474660,u2625,m171,GARDNER,Nobody. The light was bad.
89381,L474659,u2621,m171,CLAY,Who shot who?
89382,L474426,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch."
89383,L474425,u2625,m171,GARDNER,And that's more important than finding Lednov?
89384,L474424,u2621,m171,CLAY,I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
89385,L474423,u2625,m171,GARDNER,We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
89386,L474422,u2621,m171,CLAY,Maybe he did.
89387,L474421,u2625,m171,GARDNER,You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
89388,L474412,u2625,m171,GARDNER,Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
89389,L474411,u2621,m171,CLAY,Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
89390,L474769,u2631,m171,MRS. WYATT,Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
89391,L474768,u2621,m171,CLAY,And one of 'em is sick.
89392,L474767,u2631,m171,MRS. WYATT,It doesn't matter who they are.
89393,L474766,u2621,m171,CLAY,But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
89394,L474765,u2631,m171,MRS. WYATT,Tell them to come on in.
89395,L474763,u2621,m171,CLAY,Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
89396,L474762,u2631,m171,MRS. WYATT,You don't know how good it is to see you.
89397,L475232,u2629,m171,MARY,I haven't got the job yet.
89398,L475231,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that."
89399,L475230,u2629,m171,MARY,Why?
89400,L475229,u2621,m171,CLAY,"That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?"
89401,L475227,u2629,m171,MARY,To the other side of the street.
89402,L475226,u2621,m171,CLAY,Where you going?
89403,L475219,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Like I said, women get in the way sometimes."
89404,L475218,u2629,m171,MARY,Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
89405,L475217,u2621,m171,CLAY,Thanks for taking over.
89406,L475174,u2629,m171,MARY,"By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine."
89407,L475173,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Goodbye, Mary."
89408,L475172,u2629,m171,MARY,Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
89409,L475164,u2621,m171,CLAY,Maybe they will.
89410,L475163,u2629,m171,MARY,I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
89411,L475162,u2621,m171,CLAY,Hurry up.
89412,L475161,u2629,m171,MARY,I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
89413,L475159,u2621,m171,CLAY,I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
89414,L475158,u2629,m171,MARY,Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
89415,L475155,u2629,m171,MARY,Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
89416,L475154,u2621,m171,CLAY,It's going to Sonora.
89417,L475153,u2629,m171,MARY,"Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me."
89418,L475149,u2621,m171,CLAY,I'm sorry.
89419,L475148,u2629,m171,MARY,I won't have you fighting over me.
89420,L475122,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses."
89421,L475121,u2629,m171,MARY,"If you want to go on, I can make it all right."
89422,L475120,u2621,m171,CLAY,So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
89423,L475068,u2621,m171,CLAY,There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
89424,L475067,u2629,m171,MARY,"Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid."
89425,L475064,u2621,m171,CLAY,That's right -- worry about your clothes --
89426,L475063,u2629,m171,MARY,All my clothes --
89427,L475062,u2621,m171,CLAY,I suppose that's my fault.
89428,L475061,u2629,m171,MARY,"No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock."
89429,L475035,u2629,m171,MARY,"Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it."
89430,L475034,u2621,m171,CLAY,All right -- it's said!
89431,L475033,u2629,m171,MARY,Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
89432,L475032,u2621,m171,CLAY,"If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy."
89433,L475031,u2629,m171,MARY,I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
89434,L475030,u2629,m171,MARY,I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
89435,L475029,u2621,m171,CLAY,What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
89436,L475026,u2629,m171,MARY,What does a man usually tell a girl?
89437,L475025,u2621,m171,CLAY,What?
89438,L475024,u2629,m171,MARY,"Tell me, darling."
89439,L475023,u2629,m171,MARY,You don't mean that Clay.
89440,L475022,u2621,m171,CLAY,Maybe it's better that way.
89441,L475021,u2629,m171,MARY,You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
89442,L474981,u2629,m171,MARY,Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
89443,L474980,u2621,m171,CLAY,"You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?"
89444,L474977,u2629,m171,MARY,So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
89445,L474976,u2621,m171,CLAY,You know so much about me -- figure it out.
89446,L474974,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you."
89447,L474973,u2629,m171,MARY,I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
89448,L474972,u2621,m171,CLAY,Why do you think?
89449,L474971,u2629,m171,MARY,Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
89450,L474967,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back."
89451,L474966,u2629,m171,MARY,Don't you trust me?
89452,L474943,u2621,m171,CLAY,"No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail."
89453,L474942,u2629,m171,MARY,You're not going out to look for them?
89454,L474941,u2621,m171,CLAY,Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
89455,L474940,u2621,m171,CLAY,It's too light yet.
89456,L474939,u2629,m171,MARY,Are we leaving?
89457,L474906,u2621,m171,CLAY,That's fine.
89458,L474905,u2629,m171,MARY,He knows his alphabet.
89459,L474840,u2629,m171,MARY,Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
89460,L474839,u2621,m171,CLAY,Will she be dark or fair?
89461,L474838,u2629,m171,MARY,But the rest is right.
89462,L474837,u2621,m171,CLAY,I'll make the soap myself.
89463,L474836,u2629,m171,MARY,She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
89464,L474835,u2621,m171,CLAY,Go on. Tell me more about her.
89465,L474834,u2629,m171,MARY,"Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking."
89466,L474833,u2629,m171,MARY,You should know. She's in your dream.
89467,L474832,u2621,m171,CLAY,The who?
89468,L474831,u2629,m171,MARY,You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
89469,L474830,u2621,m171,CLAY,Thanks.
89470,L474829,u2629,m171,MARY,I hope you get everything you want out of life --
89471,L474827,u2629,m171,MARY,You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
89472,L474826,u2621,m171,CLAY,I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
89473,L474825,u2629,m171,MARY,You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
89474,L474824,u2621,m171,CLAY,And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
89475,L474823,u2629,m171,MARY,I suppose it is.
89476,L474822,u2621,m171,CLAY,"I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be."
89477,L474819,u2621,m171,CLAY,"I hope so, too."
89478,L474818,u2629,m171,MARY,"No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them."
89479,L474817,u2621,m171,CLAY,Coffee?
89480,L474786,u2621,m171,CLAY,It's a long walk back to Aspen.
89481,L474785,u2629,m171,MARY,We can't stay here!
89482,L474784,u2621,m171,CLAY,Hold on.
89483,L474783,u2629,m171,MARY,I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
89484,L474782,u2621,m171,CLAY,Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
89485,L474781,u2629,m171,MARY,So that was why she tried to run away.
89486,L474712,u2621,m171,CLAY,"No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people."
89487,L474711,u2629,m171,MARY,Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
89488,L474710,u2621,m171,CLAY,But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
89489,L474689,u2621,m171,CLAY,His letters will keep.
89490,L474688,u2629,m171,MARY,They're stragglin'.
89491,L474687,u2621,m171,CLAY,Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
89492,L474686,u2629,m171,MARY,Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
89493,L474684,u2621,m171,CLAY,Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
89494,L474683,u2629,m171,MARY,He's learning his letters.
89495,L474682,u2621,m171,CLAY,Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
89496,L474630,u2621,m171,CLAY,Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
89497,L474629,u2629,m171,MARY,Like what?
89498,L474626,u2629,m171,MARY,That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
89499,L474625,u2621,m171,CLAY,Yeah.
89500,L474624,u2629,m171,MARY,There's a nice boy.
89501,L474596,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Go on, there's a good boy."
89502,L474595,u2629,m171,MARY,"Would you, Mr. Phillips?"
89503,L474594,u2621,m171,CLAY,Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
89504,L474592,u2621,m171,CLAY,"I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it."
89505,L474591,u2629,m171,MARY,If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
89506,L474585,u2629,m171,MARY,And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
89507,L474584,u2621,m171,CLAY,Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
89508,L474549,u2621,m171,CLAY,In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
89509,L474548,u2629,m171,MARY,Where do you keep the can opener?
89510,L474547,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee."
89511,L474546,u2629,m171,MARY,"But you eat, don't you?"
89512,L474545,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp."
89513,L474544,u2629,m171,MARY,Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
89514,L474538,u2621,m171,CLAY,It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
89515,L474537,u2629,m171,MARY,So am I.
89516,L474524,u2621,m171,CLAY,I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
89517,L474523,u2629,m171,MARY,And this is Helen Carter.
89518,L474513,u2629,m171,MARY,Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
89519,L474512,u2621,m171,CLAY,What's the matter with her?
89520,L474509,u2621,m171,CLAY,You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
89521,L474508,u2629,m171,MARY,Our kind of women?
89522,L474504,u2621,m171,CLAY,"I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses."
89523,L474503,u2629,m171,MARY,We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
89524,L474502,u2621,m171,CLAY,You can stay here if you like.
89525,L474501,u2629,m171,MARY,What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
89526,L474500,u2621,m171,CLAY,Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
89527,L474499,u2629,m171,MARY,You can't leave us here.
89528,L474498,u2621,m171,CLAY,Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
89529,L474497,u2629,m171,MARY,They won't be riding in the wagon.
89530,L474490,u2621,m171,CLAY,Just about.
89531,L474489,u2629,m171,MARY,As far as -- Sonora?
89532,L474488,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Yes, ma'am."
89533,L474485,u2621,m171,CLAY,I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
89534,L474484,u2629,m171,MARY,And this is Helen Carter.
89535,L474483,u2629,m171,MARY,It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
89536,L474482,u2621,m171,CLAY,This must have been in the family a long time.
89537,L474479,u2629,m171,MARY,Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
89538,L474478,u2621,m171,CLAY,What's the matter with her?
89539,L474477,u2629,m171,MARY,No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
89540,L474476,u2621,m171,CLAY,Anybody hurt?
89541,L474569,u2622,m171,CLAYTON,"Hello, Miss Wells."
89542,L474568,u2621,m171,CLAY,Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
89543,L474565,u2622,m171,CLAYTON,She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
89544,L474564,u2621,m171,CLAY,So did I. They were in it.
89545,L474563,u2622,m171,CLAYTON,I found their surrey --
89546,L474562,u2622,m171,CLAYTON,"A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone."
89547,L474561,u2621,m171,CLAY,Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
89548,L474560,u2622,m171,CLAYTON,Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
89549,L474898,u2621,m171,CLAY,No they won't.
89550,L474897,u2623,m171,ELAINE,You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
89551,L474896,u2621,m171,CLAY,I can't --
89552,L474535,u2621,m171,CLAY,How's that?
89553,L474534,u2623,m171,ELAINE,Which ranch?
89554,L474533,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Stretch out under the seat, Miss."
89555,L474518,u2621,m171,CLAY,It wouldn't happen to be this...
89556,L474517,u2623,m171,ELAINE,I -- lost something.
89557,L475209,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China..."
89558,L475208,u2621,m171,CLAY,I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
89559,L475207,u2632,m171,STEVE,So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
89560,L475206,u2621,m171,CLAY,Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
89561,L475205,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?"
89562,L475204,u2621,m171,CLAY,You'll live.
89563,L475203,u2632,m171,STEVE,Kind of sore.
89564,L475202,u2621,m171,CLAY,How's that?
89565,L475188,u2621,m171,CLAY,I just wondered. Let's go.
89566,L475187,u2632,m171,STEVE,Sure. What other reason would there be?
89567,L475186,u2621,m171,CLAY,Is that the only reason you came back?
89568,L475185,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'."
89569,L475184,u2621,m171,CLAY,What did you come back for?
89570,L475182,u2621,m171,CLAY,You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
89571,L475181,u2632,m171,STEVE,Half of them are mine.
89572,L475179,u2621,m171,CLAY,You want to split up? --
89573,L475178,u2632,m171,STEVE,It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
89574,L475177,u2632,m171,STEVE,"She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different..."
89575,L475176,u2621,m171,CLAY,I don't care what she asked you.
89576,L475175,u2632,m171,STEVE,You know what she asked me?
89577,L475143,u2632,m171,STEVE,"You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --"
89578,L475142,u2621,m171,CLAY,I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
89579,L475141,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that."
89580,L475140,u2621,m171,CLAY,"You keep your nose out of my life, young fella."
89581,L475139,u2632,m171,STEVE,You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
89582,L475138,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told."
89583,L475137,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Go on, hit me."
89584,L475135,u2632,m171,STEVE,What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
89585,L475134,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old."
89586,L475133,u2632,m171,STEVE,I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
89587,L475132,u2621,m171,CLAY,Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
89588,L475130,u2632,m171,STEVE,That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
89589,L475129,u2621,m171,CLAY,"All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires."
89590,L475127,u2621,m171,CLAY,You better start.
89591,L475126,u2632,m171,STEVE,"I didn't stop to think, Clay."
89592,L474995,u2621,m171,CLAY,Just the grub box and bed rolls.
89593,L474994,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?"
89594,L474933,u2621,m171,CLAY,There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
89595,L474932,u2632,m171,STEVE,"I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to."
89596,L474931,u2621,m171,CLAY,Don't go arguing with your teacher.
89597,L474912,u2632,m171,STEVE,There's only two of them now.
89598,L474911,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Finished, son?"
89599,L474910,u2632,m171,STEVE,Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
89600,L474705,u2621,m171,CLAY,But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
89601,L474704,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Yeah, it does."
89602,L474703,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead."
89603,L474702,u2632,m171,STEVE,Maybe you shoulda killed him.
89604,L474701,u2621,m171,CLAY,I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
89605,L474700,u2632,m171,STEVE,Oh... that's the time you went away.
89606,L474699,u2621,m171,CLAY,That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
89607,L474698,u2632,m171,STEVE,Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
89608,L474697,u2621,m171,CLAY,You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
89609,L474696,u2632,m171,STEVE,Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
89610,L474695,u2621,m171,CLAY,I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
89611,L474694,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him."
89612,L474692,u2632,m171,STEVE,I won't again.
89613,L474691,u2621,m171,CLAY,"It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job."
89614,L474675,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size."
89615,L474674,u2632,m171,STEVE,Can I have my gun back?
89616,L474673,u2621,m171,CLAY,"That's right, Steve."
89617,L474672,u2632,m171,STEVE,A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
89618,L474670,u2621,m171,CLAY,Good thing you didn't.
89619,L474669,u2632,m171,STEVE,They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
89620,L474668,u2621,m171,CLAY,How'd you happen to miss?
89621,L474667,u2632,m171,STEVE,There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
89622,L474552,u2621,m171,CLAY,Swimming.
89623,L474551,u2632,m171,STEVE,Where'd they go?
89624,L474496,u2632,m171,STEVE,Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
89625,L474495,u2621,m171,CLAY,I've got eleven horses.
89626,L474474,u2621,m171,CLAY,"Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear."
89627,L474473,u2632,m171,STEVE,They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
89628,L474470,u2632,m171,STEVE,Lednov.
89629,L474469,u2621,m171,CLAY,He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
89630,L474468,u2632,m171,STEVE,Why?
89631,L474467,u2621,m171,CLAY,Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
89632,L474466,u2632,m171,STEVE,Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
89633,L474464,u2621,m171,CLAY,Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
89634,L474463,u2632,m171,STEVE,And meet him there.
89635,L474462,u2621,m171,CLAY,That's Lednov!  We come along here.
89636,L474456,u2621,m171,CLAY,All right. I'll tell you.
89637,L474455,u2632,m171,STEVE,Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
89638,L474454,u2621,m171,CLAY,Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
89639,L474453,u2632,m171,STEVE,At the ranch maybe?
89640,L474452,u2621,m171,CLAY,Yes.
89641,L474451,u2632,m171,STEVE,You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
89642,L474449,u2632,m171,STEVE,This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
89643,L474448,u2621,m171,CLAY,The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
89644,L474447,u2632,m171,STEVE,In a fight?
89645,L474446,u2621,m171,CLAY,You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
89646,L474445,u2632,m171,STEVE,What was he in jail for?
89647,L474444,u2621,m171,CLAY,The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
89648,L474443,u2632,m171,STEVE,But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
89649,L474440,u2632,m171,STEVE,Nice.
89650,L474439,u2621,m171,CLAY,No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
89651,L474438,u2632,m171,STEVE,"You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember."
89652,L474437,u2621,m171,CLAY,I don't want to run short.
89653,L474436,u2632,m171,STEVE,Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
89654,L474435,u2621,m171,CLAY,Like what?
89655,L474434,u2632,m171,STEVE,"You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me."
89656,L474430,u2621,m171,CLAY,A man I used to know.
89657,L474429,u2632,m171,STEVE,Who's Lednov?
89658,L474402,u2632,m171,STEVE,I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
89659,L474401,u2621,m171,CLAY,That's right.
89660,L474395,u2621,m171,CLAY,A little hot.
89661,L474394,u2632,m171,STEVE,How does she draw?
89662,L474801,u2633,m171,WYATT,What's there to be fair about?
89663,L474800,u2621,m171,CLAY,You're not bein' quite fair.
89664,L474798,u2633,m171,WYATT,Nobody asked you to.
89665,L474797,u2621,m171,CLAY,I can't take her with me.
89666,L474796,u2633,m171,WYATT,"All right, you didn't know."
89667,L474795,u2621,m171,CLAY,"I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter."
89668,L474794,u2633,m171,WYATT,What's there to be fair about?
89669,L474793,u2621,m171,CLAY,You're not bein' quite fair.
89670,L474791,u2633,m171,WYATT,Nobody asked you to.
89671,L474790,u2621,m171,CLAY,I can't take her with me.
89672,L474789,u2633,m171,WYATT,"All right, you didn't know."
89673,L474788,u2621,m171,CLAY,"I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was."
89674,L474761,u2621,m171,CLAY,The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
89675,L474760,u2633,m171,WYATT,"Yeah, how did you know?"
89676,L474759,u2621,m171,CLAY,Three men on matched roans?
89677,L474758,u2633,m171,WYATT,You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
89678,L474654,u2632,m171,STEVE,That's a good girl.
89679,L474653,u2623,m171,ELAINE,I'm sorry. Let's go.
89680,L474652,u2632,m171,STEVE,Don't act so -- crazy.
89681,L474651,u2623,m171,ELAINE,Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
89682,L474650,u2632,m171,STEVE,Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
89683,L474649,u2632,m171,STEVE,"What's botherin' you, anyway?"
89684,L474648,u2623,m171,ELAINE,I said I didn't care.
89685,L474647,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance."
89686,L474646,u2623,m171,ELAINE,I don't care.
89687,L474645,u2632,m171,STEVE,You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
89688,L474886,u2623,m171,ELAINE,If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
89689,L474885,u2627,m171,HELEN,"There, there. Don't you upset yourself --"
89690,L474884,u2623,m171,ELAINE,She mustn't -- don't you let her --
89691,L474883,u2627,m171,HELEN,That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
89692,L474882,u2623,m171,ELAINE,Go away -- please.
89693,L474881,u2627,m171,HELEN,Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
89694,L474880,u2623,m171,ELAINE,Stop it -- stop it.
89695,L474879,u2627,m171,HELEN,"Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did."
89696,L474878,u2623,m171,ELAINE,I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
89697,L474877,u2627,m171,HELEN,Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
89698,L474876,u2623,m171,ELAINE,But I want to stay.
89699,L474875,u2627,m171,HELEN,Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
89700,L474874,u2623,m171,ELAINE,It isn't that --
89701,L474873,u2627,m171,HELEN,"If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut."
89702,L474872,u2623,m171,ELAINE,Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
89703,L474871,u2627,m171,HELEN,He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
89704,L474870,u2623,m171,ELAINE,Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
89705,L475043,u2627,m171,HELEN,"Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about."
89706,L475042,u2624,m171,FOWLER,I figure we'll get along just fine.
89707,L475037,u2624,m171,FOWLER,"Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it."
89708,L475036,u2627,m171,HELEN,You're sure there's more where this came from?
89709,L475014,u2627,m171,HELEN,Then why stay in the hills.
89710,L475013,u2624,m171,FOWLER,"Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder."
89711,L475012,u2627,m171,HELEN,I like it.
89712,L475011,u2624,m171,FOWLER,That sure smells good.
89713,L475009,u2627,m171,HELEN,"You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?"
89714,L475008,u2624,m171,FOWLER,Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
89715,L475007,u2627,m171,HELEN,"The way you act, it must be something pretty secret."
89716,L475006,u2624,m171,FOWLER,Just a thing I was workin' on.
89717,L475005,u2627,m171,HELEN,What is it?
89718,L475004,u2624,m171,FOWLER,No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
89719,L475003,u2627,m171,HELEN,That something I shouldn't see?
89720,L475002,u2627,m171,HELEN,Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
89721,L475001,u2624,m171,FOWLER,You got no business snoopin' around --
89722,L475092,u2624,m171,FOWLER,They went on like I told you.
89723,L475091,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,"When I ask questions, I like to hear answers."
89724,L475086,u2624,m171,FOWLER,Go ahead.
89725,L475085,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Suppose I take a look.
89726,L475084,u2624,m171,FOWLER,Yeah.
89727,L475083,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,And you're all alone.
89728,L475082,u2624,m171,FOWLER,Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
89729,L475081,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
89730,L475080,u2624,m171,FOWLER,There aren't any women here.
89731,L475079,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Even women?
89732,L475078,u2624,m171,FOWLER,"Yes, people make me restless."
89733,L475077,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,What's the matter -- restless?
89734,L475076,u2624,m171,FOWLER,"Well, say it."
89735,L475075,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
89736,L474392,u2626,m171,GRAHAM,I don't like to see you go.
89737,L474391,u2629,m171,MARY,Goodbye and thanks.
89738,L474390,u2626,m171,GRAHAM,I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
89739,L474389,u2629,m171,MARY,We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
89740,L474388,u2626,m171,GRAHAM,They shouldn't have done that.
89741,L474387,u2629,m171,MARY,Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
89742,L474381,u2629,m171,MARY,"Thank you, Mr. Graham."
89743,L474380,u2626,m171,GRAHAM,There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
89744,L474370,u2626,m171,GRAHAM,Depends on how good you drive.
89745,L474369,u2629,m171,MARY,Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
89746,L474368,u2626,m171,GRAHAM,What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
89747,L474367,u2629,m171,MARY,Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
89748,L475057,u2629,m171,MARY,I don't care what he thinks.
89749,L475056,u2627,m171,HELEN,"Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her."
89750,L475048,u2629,m171,MARY,That's it then.
89751,L475047,u2627,m171,HELEN,I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
89752,L475046,u2627,m171,HELEN,Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
89753,L475045,u2629,m171,MARY,-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
89754,L475040,u2627,m171,HELEN,Maybe you are. I'm not.
89755,L475039,u2629,m171,MARY,Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
89756,L474992,u2627,m171,HELEN,Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
89757,L474991,u2629,m171,MARY,We might as well start a fire.
89758,L474862,u2627,m171,HELEN,Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
89759,L474861,u2629,m171,MARY,What's the use.
89760,L474860,u2627,m171,HELEN,Go on. Have another try at him.
89761,L474858,u2629,m171,MARY,"You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least..."
89762,L474857,u2627,m171,HELEN,Maybe I better start working on him.
89763,L474856,u2629,m171,MARY,How many ways can a man say no.
89764,L474855,u2627,m171,HELEN,You're not giving up?
89765,L474854,u2627,m171,HELEN,What are you waiting for? Do something.
89766,L474853,u2629,m171,MARY,He certainly could. About a month.
89767,L474852,u2627,m171,HELEN,Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
89768,L474851,u2629,m171,MARY,"No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora."
89769,L474850,u2627,m171,HELEN,We don't want to go there.
89770,L474849,u2629,m171,MARY,Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
89771,L474848,u2627,m171,HELEN,How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
89772,L474845,u2629,m171,MARY,There's still tomorrow morning.
89773,L474844,u2627,m171,HELEN,And we're running out of that.
89774,L474843,u2629,m171,MARY,"I tried my best, but these things take time."
89775,L474812,u2627,m171,HELEN,Quit worryin' about Elaine.
89776,L474811,u2629,m171,MARY,That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
89777,L474810,u2627,m171,HELEN,It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
89778,L474579,u2629,m171,MARY,"Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done."
89779,L474578,u2627,m171,HELEN,With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
89780,L474516,u2629,m171,MARY,Now where's she goin'? --
89781,L474515,u2627,m171,HELEN,You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
89782,L474511,u2629,m171,MARY,Maybe in Sonora.
89783,L474510,u2627,m171,HELEN,"Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?"
89784,L475110,u2627,m171,HELEN,I don't know -- I don't know.
89785,L475109,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,How far up the trail?
89786,L475108,u2627,m171,HELEN,Up the trail.
89787,L475107,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Where is he?
89788,L475106,u2627,m171,HELEN,Clay Phillips.
89789,L475105,u2627,m171,HELEN,Stop it --
89790,L475104,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
89791,L475103,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Who brought you here?
89792,L475102,u2627,m171,HELEN,Everybody knows --
89793,L475101,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,How do you know who we are?
89794,L475072,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,"Yeah, we sure have."
89795,L475071,u2630,m171,MCCALL,We got company. Female company.
89796,L474750,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
89797,L474749,u2630,m171,MCCALL,One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
89798,L474748,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,I said let's go.
89799,L474747,u2630,m171,MCCALL,He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
89800,L474746,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Because there's a man I want to see.
89801,L474745,u2630,m171,MCCALL,What for?
89802,L474744,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,We got to get movin'.
89803,L474730,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Lookin' around.
89804,L474729,u2633,m171,WYATT,What are you doin' --
89805,L474722,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
89806,L474721,u2633,m171,WYATT,"That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like."
89807,L474720,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Put on another one.
89808,L474719,u2633,m171,WYATT,He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
89809,L474716,u2628,m171,LEDNOV,Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
89810,L474715,u2633,m171,WYATT,"Why, yes. They're all I need..."
89811,L475225,u2629,m171,MARY,"If you need me, I'll be --"
89812,L475224,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Goodnight, Miss Wells."
89813,L475223,u2629,m171,MARY,Goodnight.
89814,L475151,u2629,m171,MARY,Steve --
89815,L475150,u2632,m171,STEVE,You don't know what it is to be sorry.
89816,L475124,u2629,m171,MARY,"Thanks, Steve."
89817,L475123,u2632,m171,STEVE,You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
89818,L475115,u2632,m171,STEVE,It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
89819,L475114,u2629,m171,MARY,For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
89820,L474963,u2629,m171,MARY,Let me do that.
89821,L474962,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Oh, sure."
89822,L474961,u2629,m171,MARY,She was only teasin'.
89823,L474958,u2632,m171,STEVE,He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
89824,L474957,u2629,m171,MARY,But you're his brother.
89825,L474956,u2632,m171,STEVE,Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
89826,L474953,u2632,m171,STEVE,I was doin' both. Here.
89827,L474952,u2629,m171,MARY,You were supposed to be reading words.
89828,L474951,u2632,m171,STEVE,Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
89829,L474949,u2632,m171,STEVE,Sure.
89830,L474948,u2629,m171,MARY,And you've got me all figured out?
89831,L474947,u2632,m171,STEVE,Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
89832,L474945,u2629,m171,MARY,"Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave."
89833,L474944,u2632,m171,STEVE,Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
89834,L474935,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?"
89835,L474934,u2629,m171,MARY,"Well, Steve?"
89836,L474930,u2632,m171,STEVE,I feel good anyways.
89837,L474929,u2629,m171,MARY,"You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good."
89838,L474928,u2632,m171,STEVE,"An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?"
89839,L474927,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?..."
89840,L474926,u2629,m171,MARY,"Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were..."
89841,L474925,u2629,m171,MARY,Would they be good to eat?
89842,L474924,u2632,m171,STEVE,How about California?
89843,L474923,u2629,m171,MARY,No.
89844,L474922,u2632,m171,STEVE,Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
89845,L474921,u2629,m171,MARY,Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
89846,L474920,u2632,m171,STEVE,What do they look like?
89847,L474919,u2629,m171,MARY,Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
89848,L474918,u2632,m171,STEVE,U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
89849,L474917,u2629,m171,MARY,There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
89850,L474916,u2632,m171,STEVE,"-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!"
89851,L474904,u2629,m171,MARY,"Without someone to teach you, it's tough."
89852,L474903,u2632,m171,STEVE,"And that's tough, isn't it?"
89853,L474902,u2629,m171,MARY,From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
89854,L474901,u2632,m171,STEVE,Then I know my alphabet.
89855,L474900,u2629,m171,MARY,That's the end of the line.
89856,L474899,u2632,m171,STEVE,What comes after Z?
89857,L474806,u2629,m171,MARY,No. We're not stayin' --
89858,L474805,u2632,m171,STEVE,Aren't we stayin'?
89859,L474680,u2632,m171,STEVE,Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
89860,L474679,u2629,m171,MARY,Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
89861,L474678,u2632,m171,STEVE,"I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids."
89862,L474677,u2629,m171,MARY,Why not? You went farther than that last time.
89863,L474676,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Gee, I can't."
89864,L474623,u2629,m171,MARY,"Good night, Steve."
89865,L474622,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Good night, Miss Wells."
89866,L474620,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street."
89867,L474619,u2629,m171,MARY,Did someone say I wasn't nice?
89868,L474618,u2632,m171,STEVE,You're so nice.
89869,L474617,u2632,m171,STEVE,"That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be."
89870,L474616,u2629,m171,MARY,Maybe I could start you out.
89871,L474615,u2632,m171,STEVE,I sure would.
89872,L474614,u2629,m171,MARY,Would you like to learn them?
89873,L474612,u2629,m171,MARY,Don't you even know your letters?
89874,L474611,u2632,m171,STEVE,It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
89875,L474610,u2629,m171,MARY,But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
89876,L474609,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Since I can remember, Ma'am."
89877,L474608,u2629,m171,MARY,"Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?"
89878,L474606,u2632,m171,STEVE,"I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures."
89879,L474605,u2629,m171,MARY,"Is that your kind of reading, Steve?"
89880,L474487,u2629,m171,MARY,I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
89881,L474486,u2632,m171,STEVE,"Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?"
89882,L485452,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body."
89883,L485451,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Alex, what are you doing?"
89884,L485450,u2634,m172,ALEX,"No, I won't let you do it."
89885,L485364,u2634,m172,ALEX,Ha! Right bitch!
89886,L485363,u2637,m172,CINDY,I think he wants me.
89887,L485362,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash."
89888,L485353,u2634,m172,ALEX,Wife?!
89889,L485352,u2637,m172,CINDY,I found a picture of his wife.
89890,L485351,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Ah, they just don't know you the way I do."
89891,L485350,u2637,m172,CINDY,Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
89892,L484949,u2637,m172,CINDY,"No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's..."
89893,L484948,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?"
89894,L484947,u2637,m172,CINDY,That's always tough. How long were you together?
89895,L484946,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all."
89896,L484945,u2637,m172,CINDY,Are you okay?
89897,L484968,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket."
89898,L484967,u2634,m172,ALEX,That's it.
89899,L484966,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"In room ""302"" at ten o'clock?"
89900,L484965,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Me, too. 101?"
89901,L484955,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, ""I'm sorry,"" and you said, ""Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass."" I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy."
89902,L484954,u2635,m172,BRENDA,Do I know you?
89903,L484953,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Hey, Brenda."
89904,L485480,u2647,m172,THEO,Would you die already?!
89905,L485479,u2634,m172,ALEX,My favorite memory was when we --
89906,L485477,u2647,m172,THEO,Never happened!
89907,L485476,u2634,m172,ALEX,"Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --"
89908,L485475,u2647,m172,THEO,Okay... maybe that would be best.
89909,L485474,u2634,m172,ALEX,Oh... I guess I'll die now.
89910,L485473,u2647,m172,THEO,"Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day."
89911,L485472,u2634,m172,ALEX,"And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever."
89912,L485612,u2637,m172,CINDY,"It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!"
89913,L485611,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Cindy, what's going on?"
89914,L485527,u2635,m172,BRENDA,Okay.
89915,L485526,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!"
89916,L485522,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Hey, I have an idea..."
89917,L485521,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone."
89918,L485514,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"What?! What is it, a monster?!"
89919,L485513,u2637,m172,CINDY,It's coming!
89920,L485512,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut."
89921,L485511,u2637,m172,CINDY,Oh my God! We're dead!
89922,L485508,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me."
89923,L485507,u2637,m172,CINDY,Help!
89924,L485153,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues..."
89925,L485152,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Brenda, are you okay? Come sit."
89926,L485151,u2635,m172,BRENDA,Ouch!!
89927,L484964,u2637,m172,CINDY,Psychology.
89928,L484963,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?"
89929,L484962,u2637,m172,CINDY,Thanks.
89930,L484961,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Hey girl, that jacket is slamming."
89931,L484960,u2637,m172,CINDY,Really? That's amazing.
89932,L484959,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today."
89933,L484958,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Actually, I just met her. This is Alex."
89934,L484957,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help."
89935,L484956,u2637,m172,CINDY,"We already know each other. Hey, Brenda."
89936,L485148,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish."
89937,L485147,u2635,m172,BRENDA,But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
89938,L485146,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"No, he lost the house after the stock market crash."
89939,L485145,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence."
89940,L485144,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth."
89941,L485143,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate..."
89942,L485142,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora."
89943,L485649,u2645,m172,RAY,Okay.
89944,L485648,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Ray, run faster."
89945,L485491,u2645,m172,RAY,I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
89946,L485490,u2635,m172,BRENDA,Where's Shorty?
89947,L485435,u2635,m172,BRENDA,He's so brave.
89948,L485434,u2645,m172,RAY,He's right. I should go first.
89949,L485252,u2645,m172,RAY,"Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around."
89950,L485251,u2635,m172,BRENDA,Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
89951,L485243,u2645,m172,RAY,"Yeah, me too."
89952,L485242,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man."
89953,L485241,u2645,m172,RAY,You sure?
89954,L485240,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"No, stay."
89955,L485239,u2645,m172,RAY,"So, I guess I can go now."
89956,L485238,u2635,m172,BRENDA,I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
89957,L485237,u2645,m172,RAY,I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
89958,L485236,u2635,m172,BRENDA,"Ray, have you been here all this time?"
89959,L485235,u2645,m172,RAY,Shhh... It's okay.
89960,L485024,u2635,m172,BRENDA,Hello Ray.
89961,L485023,u2645,m172,RAY,Hello Brenda.
89962,L485724,u2637,m172,CINDY,Hot dogs.
89963,L485723,u2636,m172,BUDDY,I don't care. You pick.
89964,L485722,u2637,m172,CINDY,What should we get?
89965,L485721,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
89966,L485720,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic."
89967,L485719,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Hey, wanna' share a soda?"
89968,L485718,u2636,m172,BUDDY,That's what your man is supposed to do.
89969,L485717,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!"
89970,L485716,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Hey, look out, a bee!"
89971,L485715,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Let's get a hot dog.
89972,L485714,u2637,m172,CINDY,"That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay."
89973,L485713,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love..."
89974,L485712,u2637,m172,CINDY,Then what are we going to do?
89975,L485711,u2636,m172,BUDDY,I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
89976,L485710,u2637,m172,CINDY,Oh.
89977,L485709,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
89978,L485708,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Look, what I'm trying to say --"
89979,L485707,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Look, what I'm trying to say --"
89980,L485706,u2637,m172,CINDY,Listen to me I --
89981,L485705,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Listen to me I --
89982,L485704,u2637,m172,CINDY,"I know, but I've been thinking --"
89983,L485703,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"I know, but I've been thinking --"
89984,L485702,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend."
89985,L485701,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Cindy, about this whole friendship thing..."
89986,L485700,u2637,m172,CINDY,"There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this."
89987,L485699,u2636,m172,BUDDY,There's something I really want to share with you.
89988,L485639,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die."
89989,L485638,u2637,m172,CINDY,"No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants."
89990,L485637,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Cindy, let me..."
89991,L485563,u2637,m172,CINDY,Well... okay... but only as a friend.
89992,L485562,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend."
89993,L485561,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --"
89994,L485560,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Better try a little higher.
89995,L485559,u2636,m172,BUDDY,No. Keep rubbing.
89996,L485558,u2637,m172,CINDY,Feel that?
89997,L485557,u2636,m172,BUDDY,No. Try a little higher.
89998,L485556,u2637,m172,CINDY,Can you feel that?
89999,L485555,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold."
90000,L485544,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Shit!
90001,L485543,u2637,m172,CINDY,He's here.
90002,L485542,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked."
90003,L485541,u2637,m172,CINDY,"What about you, Buddy?"
90004,L485540,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Huh?
90005,L485539,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon."
90006,L485538,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Great!!!
90007,L485537,u2637,m172,CINDY,We should act out our inner most fantasies.
90008,L485536,u2636,m172,BUDDY,I was thinking the same thing.
90009,L485535,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it."
90010,L485534,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Yes...
90011,L485533,u2637,m172,CINDY,That we should take our friendship a little further?
90012,L485532,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking..."
90013,L485531,u2637,m172,CINDY,Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
90014,L485530,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Yeah, I think I'm bleeding."
90015,L485505,u2637,m172,CINDY,Hugh Kane.
90016,L485504,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?"
90017,L485501,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand."
90018,L485500,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Let's get outta here.
90019,L485499,u2637,m172,CINDY,It looks like the furnace.
90020,L485498,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Where the hell are we?
90021,L485232,u2637,m172,CINDY,Alright!
90022,L485231,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart..."
90023,L485230,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny."
90024,L485229,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?"
90025,L485228,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Whoa, check this out. She looks like you."
90026,L485225,u2637,m172,CINDY,Shhh!
90027,L485224,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Dude, somebody's on the rag."
90028,L485222,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part."
90029,L485221,u2637,m172,CINDY,Buddy...
90030,L485219,u2637,m172,CINDY,Okay.
90031,L485218,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Sure. We can practice talking.
90032,L485217,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?"
90033,L485216,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?"
90034,L485215,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know."
90035,L485214,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Then what kinda stuff can we do?
90036,L485213,u2637,m172,CINDY,"That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me."
90037,L485212,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend."
90038,L485211,u2637,m172,CINDY,"You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing..."
90039,L485088,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Open chest!!!
90040,L485087,u2637,m172,CINDY,Hi Buddy.
90041,L485044,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Okay. See you later, friend."
90042,L485043,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Sure, that would be cool. Friends."
90043,L485042,u2637,m172,CINDY,"But, hey, maybe we can be friends."
90044,L485041,u2637,m172,CINDY,"I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet."
90045,L485040,u2636,m172,BUDDY,Maybe we can study together or something.
90046,L485039,u2637,m172,CINDY,Yeah.
90047,L485038,u2636,m172,BUDDY,So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
90048,L485037,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff."
90049,L485036,u2636,m172,BUDDY,I meant you're into ghosts.
90050,L485035,u2637,m172,CINDY,No. I never date outside my race.
90051,L485034,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"So, I see you're really into spooks."
90052,L485033,u2637,m172,CINDY,Thanks. I'm Cindy.
90053,L485032,u2636,m172,BUDDY,"Hey, you left your book back there."
90054,L485455,u2647,m172,THEO,That means more screen time for us.
90055,L485454,u2637,m172,CINDY,But he'll kill her!
90056,L485453,u2647,m172,THEO,"Let her go, Cin."
90057,L485361,u2637,m172,CINDY,She killed herself a week before he died.
90058,L485360,u2647,m172,THEO,"So, whatever happened to her?"
90059,L485359,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Okay, I get the point."
90060,L485282,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Thanks, I'll be fine."
90061,L485281,u2647,m172,THEO,"Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me."
90062,L485272,u2637,m172,CINDY,"What, you think I did this to myself?"
90063,L485271,u2647,m172,THEO,"No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone."
90064,L485268,u2647,m172,THEO,Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
90065,L485267,u2637,m172,CINDY,I think so.
90066,L485266,u2647,m172,THEO,Are you okay?
90067,L485651,u2645,m172,RAY,"Yeah, I broke my fall."
90068,L485650,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?"
90069,L485573,u2645,m172,RAY,I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
90070,L485572,u2637,m172,CINDY,Where's Shorty?
90071,L485570,u2637,m172,CINDY,Right behind you.
90072,L485569,u2645,m172,RAY,"What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?"
90073,L485568,u2637,m172,CINDY,The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
90074,L485567,u2645,m172,RAY,This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
90075,L485566,u2637,m172,CINDY,Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
90076,L485108,u2645,m172,RAY,"Yeah, they're so warm and soft."
90077,L485107,u2637,m172,CINDY,How about these buns?
90078,L485022,u2637,m172,CINDY,I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
90079,L485021,u2645,m172,RAY,"Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on."
90080,L485020,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh, right."
90081,L485019,u2645,m172,RAY,It's the sequel.
90082,L485018,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?"
90083,L485017,u2645,m172,RAY,It's okay.
90084,L485016,u2637,m172,CINDY,"I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I..."
90085,L485733,u2640,m172,HANSON,Yes!!!!
90086,L485732,u2637,m172,CINDY,Noooo!!!
90087,L485731,u2640,m172,HANSON,"Now you'll be mine, Cindy."
90088,L485730,u2637,m172,CINDY,This can't be happening?
90089,L485729,u2640,m172,HANSON,"Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn."
90090,L485728,u2637,m172,CINDY,Both of them?
90091,L485727,u2640,m172,HANSON,"Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress."
90092,L485726,u2637,m172,CINDY,It was you...
90093,L485608,u2640,m172,HANSON,Made you say it!
90094,L485607,u2637,m172,CINDY,Stop! --
90095,L485606,u2637,m172,CINDY,Not in a thousand years.
90096,L485605,u2640,m172,HANSON,"Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me ""Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."""
90097,L485598,u2640,m172,HANSON,"Um, I'm not touching anything."
90098,L485597,u2637,m172,CINDY,Stop touching his brain!
90099,L485592,u2640,m172,HANSON,"Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain."
90100,L485591,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Hanson, please."
90101,L485579,u2640,m172,HANSON,"No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff."
90102,L485578,u2637,m172,CINDY,Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
90103,L485113,u2640,m172,HANSON,Thanks. I made them by hand.
90104,L485112,u2637,m172,CINDY,Ummm!! They smell delicious.
90105,L485061,u2640,m172,HANSON,I'm Hanson the caretaker.
90106,L485060,u2637,m172,CINDY,I'm Cindy.
90107,L485057,u2640,m172,HANSON,"Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you."
90108,L485056,u2637,m172,CINDY,Oh my God! I'm here with the...
90109,L485641,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Alright, let's take a vote..."
90110,L485640,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go."
90111,L485636,u2637,m172,CINDY,I'll go.
90112,L485635,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
90113,L485429,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,We have to destroy him.
90114,L485428,u2637,m172,CINDY,What are we gonna do?
90115,L485424,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Quick, everyone to the lab."
90116,L485423,u2637,m172,CINDY,He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
90117,L485185,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Just wait, you'll see."
90118,L485184,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,What the hell are you doing?
90119,L485030,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,I don't need your help.
90120,L485029,u2637,m172,CINDY,Would you like me to help you pass them back?
90121,L485677,u2642,m172,MCFEELY,"Soon, but first I must bless this house."
90122,L485676,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?"
90123,L485675,u2642,m172,MCFEELY,I'm sorry.
90124,L485674,u2637,m172,CINDY,"No, my friends are right here!"
90125,L485673,u2642,m172,MCFEELY,My child you are the only survivor.
90126,L485672,u2637,m172,CINDY,Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
90127,L485671,u2642,m172,MCFEELY,We? What do you mean... we?
90128,L485670,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Yes, we made it!"
90129,L485669,u2642,m172,MCFEELY,"My child, you're alive!"
90130,L485668,u2637,m172,CINDY,Father!
90131,L485663,u2646,m172,SHORTY,That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
90132,L485662,u2637,m172,CINDY,Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
90133,L485661,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Hey, y'all! What's going on?"
90134,L485585,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?"
90135,L485584,u2637,m172,CINDY,Are you?
90136,L485583,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy."
90137,L485582,u2637,m172,CINDY,She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
90138,L485181,u2637,m172,CINDY,You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
90139,L485180,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Uh, uh."
90140,L485179,u2637,m172,CINDY,Did you do that?
90141,L485178,u2646,m172,SHORTY,I told you it would taste just like chicken.
90142,L485177,u2637,m172,CINDY,"That was a great idea, Shorty."
90143,L485176,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Hey, I got an idea."
90144,L485175,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Yeah, I didn't know what else to do."
90145,L485174,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Aww, the little bird died."
90146,L484918,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later."
90147,L484917,u2637,m172,CINDY,Am I cool now?
90148,L484912,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together."
90149,L484911,u2637,m172,CINDY,Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
90150,L484910,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!"
90151,L484909,u2637,m172,CINDY,Yo! That jacket is tight.
90152,L484908,u2646,m172,SHORTY,Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
90153,L484907,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Left, right, left, right, crossover kick..."
90154,L484905,u2646,m172,SHORTY,Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
90155,L484904,u2637,m172,CINDY,Oh.
90156,L484903,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Gear. You know, clothing."
90157,L484902,u2637,m172,CINDY,Huh?
90158,L484901,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear."
90159,L484900,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not."
90160,L484899,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?"
90161,L484898,u2637,m172,CINDY,"You could use the grade, huh?"
90162,L484897,u2646,m172,SHORTY,"I don't know, but I sure hope so."
90163,L484896,u2637,m172,CINDY,"So, do you think you made it into the class?"
90164,L485301,u2637,m172,CINDY,Don't touch me!!
90165,L485300,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Saw who?!
90166,L485299,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them."
90167,L485297,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Who?
90168,L485296,u2637,m172,CINDY,I think she's starting to suspect something?
90169,L485295,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax."
90170,L485294,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"I don't like this, this..."
90171,L485293,u2637,m172,CINDY,I wouldn't go that far.
90172,L485292,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,I take it you're not mad at me.
90173,L485287,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?"
90174,L485286,u2637,m172,CINDY,Got a problem with that?
90175,L485280,u2637,m172,CINDY,There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
90176,L485279,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss."
90177,L485275,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment."
90178,L485274,u2637,m172,CINDY,"What are you getting at, Professor?"
90179,L485273,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together."
90180,L485270,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Theo, did you see the animal?"
90181,L485269,u2637,m172,CINDY,"I'm telling you, it was possessed."
90182,L485190,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
90183,L485189,u2637,m172,CINDY,I got it!
90184,L485188,u2637,m172,CINDY,Got my camera right here.
90185,L485187,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
90186,L485186,u2637,m172,CINDY,Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
90187,L485183,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here."
90188,L485182,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Alright, Cindy, what's so important?"
90189,L485140,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
90190,L485139,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Professor, what's the history of this house?"
90191,L485094,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated."
90192,L485093,u2637,m172,CINDY,"Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?"
90193,L485409,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,The keys. She took the keys.
90194,L485408,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do."
90195,L485407,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,I can do it myself.
90196,L485311,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves."
90197,L485310,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug."
90198,L485309,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"That's why we came here, remember?"
90199,L485308,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere."
90200,L485307,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,What?
90201,L485306,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
90202,L485305,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"What is it, Dwight?"
90203,L485304,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Professor, we need to talk."
90204,L485303,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
90205,L485302,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,What the hell?!
90206,L485171,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun."
90207,L485170,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded."
90208,L485169,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Are you sure it's not the tape?
90209,L485168,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,The image there.
90210,L485167,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out."
90211,L485166,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
90212,L485165,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Professor, I think you should see this."
90213,L485161,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs."
90214,L485160,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,My God! Is she dead?
90215,L485101,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?"
90216,L485100,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders."
90217,L485099,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
90218,L485082,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there."
90219,L485081,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
90220,L485077,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything."
90221,L485076,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,That one.
90222,L485075,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?"
90223,L485074,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Even in the bathroom?
90224,L485073,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Yes, I thought that it would be best."
90225,L485072,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Are those cameras all throughout the house?
90226,L485071,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances."
90227,L485070,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Fine.  What's all this stuff?
90228,L485069,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,Would you please focus?
90229,L485068,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw."
90230,L485067,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,Professor!
90231,L485066,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Right. What about condoms?
90232,L485065,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe."
90233,L485009,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone."
90234,L485008,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,In about fifteen minutes.
90235,L485007,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?"
90236,L485006,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
90237,L485005,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
90238,L485004,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,How are we going to get them all up there?
90239,L485003,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
90240,L485002,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
90241,L485001,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?"
90242,L484999,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,What's this?
90243,L484998,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met."
90244,L484997,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Willing? I like that.  And, this one?"
90245,L484996,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this."
90246,L484995,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her."
90247,L484994,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration."
90248,L484993,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,"Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing."
90249,L484992,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
90250,L484991,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Any of them hot?
90251,L484990,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
90252,L484989,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Are these all the subjects?
90253,L484988,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Here you go, Professor."
90254,L484987,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
90255,L484986,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Let me help you.
90256,L484985,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
90257,L484984,u2644,m172,PROFESSOR,Let me see the files.
90258,L484983,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,I finished all the interviews.
90259,L485459,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Alright. Come on, you guys."
90260,L485458,u2647,m172,THEO,She's right. We should stick together.
90261,L485389,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Oh, I couldn't do that."
90262,L485388,u2647,m172,THEO,What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
90263,L485387,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,That's right.
90264,L485386,u2647,m172,THEO,"You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate."
90265,L485382,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,Just a little Rogaine.
90266,L485381,u2647,m172,THEO,"Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?"
90267,L485380,u2647,m172,THEO,Of course. So sexy.
90268,L485379,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,And sexy.
90269,L485378,u2647,m172,THEO,"That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart."
90270,L485377,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,You do.
90271,L485376,u2647,m172,THEO,"The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is."
90272,L485375,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Well, there's a lot riding on this project."
90273,L485374,u2647,m172,THEO,"Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?"
90274,L485373,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,Just a little experiment.
90275,L485372,u2647,m172,THEO,What are you working on?
90276,L485371,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,Hi.
90277,L485370,u2647,m172,THEO,Hello Dwight.
90278,L485123,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate."
90279,L485122,u2640,m172,HANSON,I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
90280,L485121,u2638,m172,DWIGHT,"Yours, or the turkeys?"

90475,L491051,u2656,m173,MISTY,He goes to college with me!
90476,L491458,u2657,m173,MOM,"Oh, honey!"
90477,L491457,u2651,m173,DAD,"Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?"
90478,L491454,u2657,m173,MOM,"It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey."
90479,L491453,u2651,m173,DAD,Beverly! Not the Sterners!
90480,L491400,u2657,m173,MOM,"Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!"
90481,L491399,u2651,m173,DAD,Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
90482,L491262,u2657,m173,MOM,"It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast."
90483,L491261,u2651,m173,DAD,"I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week."
90484,L491254,u2651,m173,DAD,"Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore."
90485,L491253,u2657,m173,MOM,There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
90486,L491252,u2657,m173,MOM,Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
90487,L491251,u2651,m173,DAD,"Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!"
90488,L491250,u2657,m173,MOM,Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
90489,L491249,u2651,m173,DAD,"You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!"
90490,L491248,u2657,m173,MOM,Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
90491,L491247,u2657,m173,MOM,Ooohhhh!
90492,L491246,u2651,m173,DAD,Don't wake the kids...
90493,L491245,u2657,m173,MOM,Oooohhhh.
90494,L491244,u2651,m173,DAD,Shhhh..
90495,L491243,u2657,m173,MOM,"Oohhhh, Eugene!"
90496,L491242,u2651,m173,DAD,You bring me such peace...
90497,L491241,u2657,m173,MOM,"You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird..."
90498,L491240,u2651,m173,DAD,I love that you're my wife.
90499,L491239,u2657,m173,MOM,We can be real quiet...
90500,L491238,u2651,m173,DAD,"It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?"
90501,L491237,u2657,m173,MOM,"We have to concentrate on life, Eugene."
90502,L491236,u2651,m173,DAD,I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
90503,L491235,u2657,m173,MOM,Don't I get a kiss?
90504,L491234,u2651,m173,DAD,"Goodnight, honey."
90505,L491233,u2657,m173,MOM,I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
90506,L491232,u2651,m173,DAD,"I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow."
90507,L491196,u2657,m173,MOM,"Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli..."
90508,L491195,u2651,m173,DAD,"Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey."
90509,L491097,u2651,m173,DAD,"Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey."
90510,L491096,u2657,m173,MOM,"Chip, your ride is here."
90511,L491094,u2657,m173,MOM,Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
90512,L491093,u2651,m173,DAD,No woman would!
90513,L491092,u2657,m173,MOM,"Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!"
90514,L491091,u2651,m173,DAD,"Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults."
90515,L491060,u2651,m173,DAD,Nice?! He should have been executed!
90516,L491059,u2657,m173,MOM,That's nice.
90517,L491058,u2651,m173,DAD,"Look at this!  ""Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"""
90518,L491651,u2652,m173,DET. BRADFORD,GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
90519,L491650,u2657,m173,MOM,"Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called ""Chicks with Dicks""."
90520,L491297,u2657,m173,MOM,...People who don't mind their own business.
90521,L491296,u2652,m173,DET. BRADFORD,"""P"" as in..."
90522,L491284,u2657,m173,MOM,"Yes, I did."
90523,L491283,u2652,m173,DET. BRADFORD,"Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?"
90524,L491277,u2657,m173,MOM,What a mess.
90525,L491276,u2652,m173,DET. BRADFORD,Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
90526,L491084,u2657,m173,MOM,I know Dottie!
90527,L491083,u2652,m173,DET. BRADFORD,"Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle."
90528,L491082,u2657,m173,MOM,"Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house."
90529,L491616,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!"
90530,L491615,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,Objection! Argumentative!
90531,L491605,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
90532,L491604,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,"Who's voice was it, Dottie?"
90533,L491603,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together."
90534,L491602,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
90535,L491601,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,I certainly did.
90536,L491600,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,"Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?"
90537,L491623,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!"
90538,L491622,u2657,m173,MOM,"Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?"
90539,L491620,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!"
90540,L491619,u2657,m173,MOM,Let the record show I'm just standing here.
90541,L491618,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"Did you see her?! She just said ""Fuck you"" to me!"
90542,L491614,u2657,m173,MOM,So you admit you just lied?
90543,L491613,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,Socially... I'll have a beer.
90544,L491612,u2657,m173,MOM,So you do drink?
90545,L491611,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"One beer with lunch is hardly ""drinking""."
90546,L491610,u2657,m173,MOM,You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
90547,L491609,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,I certainly was not!
90548,L491608,u2657,m173,MOM,So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
90549,L491607,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"No, I don't."
90550,L491606,u2657,m173,MOM,Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
90551,L491334,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!"
90552,L491333,u2657,m173,MOM,"And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!"
90553,L491328,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,I didn't do it!
90554,L491327,u2657,m173,MOM,Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
90555,L491326,u2657,m173,MOM,"PUSSY-willows, Dottie!"
90556,L491325,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,What did you just say?
90557,L491323,u2657,m173,MOM,Are those pussy-willows?
90558,L491322,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,It's not fair!!
90559,L491321,u2657,m173,MOM,"Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles..."
90560,L491137,u2657,m173,MOM,COCKSUCKER!
90561,L491136,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,MOTHERFUCKER!!
90562,L491135,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,GODDAMN YOU!
90563,L491134,u2657,m173,MOM,"Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!"
90564,L491133,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"Alright, I'll try...  ""Cocksucker"". That's what she calls me."
90565,L491132,u2657,m173,MOM,I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
90566,L491131,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
90567,L491130,u2657,m173,MOM,What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
90568,L491129,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!"
90569,L491128,u2657,m173,MOM,Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
90570,L491127,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,Who is this?
90571,L491126,u2657,m173,MOM,I beg your pardon?
90572,L491125,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,"FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!"
90573,L491123,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,FUCK YOU!
90574,L491122,u2657,m173,MOM,"Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?"
90575,L491121,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,The police are tracing your call right this minute.
90576,L491120,u2657,m173,MOM,Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
90577,L491119,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,You bitch!
90578,L491118,u2657,m173,MOM,Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
90579,L491117,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
90580,L491116,u2657,m173,MOM,Is this the Cocksucker residence?
90581,L491115,u2654,m173,DOTTIE,Hello.
90582,L491702,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,"You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor."
90583,L491701,u2655,m173,MARVIN,Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
90584,L491696,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,"What do you mean, you're not sure?!"
90585,L491695,u2655,m173,MARVIN,I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
90586,L491694,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
90587,L491691,u2655,m173,MARVIN,"Yes, I was."
90588,L491690,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,"Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?"
90589,L491689,u2655,m173,MARVIN,Marvin A. Pickles.
90590,L491688,u2658,m173,MR. NAZLEROD,"State your name, please."
90591,L491386,u2656,m173,MISTY,But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
90592,L491385,u2657,m173,MOM,You got your wish.
90593,L491384,u2656,m173,MISTY,Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
90594,L491383,u2657,m173,MOM,"0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!"
90595,L491375,u2656,m173,MISTY,Watch the booth! I'll be back!
90596,L491374,u2657,m173,MOM,"It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?"
90597,L491352,u2656,m173,MISTY,Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
90598,L491351,u2657,m173,MOM,Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
90599,L491271,u2657,m173,MOM,"No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers."
90600,L491270,u2656,m173,MISTY,It's him!
90601,L491269,u2657,m173,MOM,"Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty."
90602,L491268,u2656,m173,MISTY,I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
90603,L491198,u2657,m173,MOM,"Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know."
90604,L491197,u2656,m173,MISTY,"Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer."
90605,L491062,u2657,m173,MOM,We all have bad nights.
90606,L491061,u2656,m173,MISTY,"He killed people, Mom."
90607,L491046,u2656,m173,MISTY,Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
90608,L491045,u2657,m173,MOM,And who may I ask is Carl?
90609,L491042,u2656,m173,MISTY,"Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice."
90610,L491041,u2657,m173,MOM,"You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing..."
90611,L491040,u2656,m173,MISTY,It's sugarless.
90612,L491039,u2657,m173,MOM,"That's not gum in your mouth, is it?"
90613,L491038,u2656,m173,MISTY,"I do, please."
90614,L491037,u2657,m173,MOM,Who wants fruit salad?
90615,L491671,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
90616,L491670,u2657,m173,MOM,"Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?"
90617,L491669,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,Yes... but... I didn't...
90618,L491668,u2657,m173,MOM,"And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?"
90619,L491667,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"Yes, but I lent it..."
90620,L491666,u2657,m173,MOM,"That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?"
90621,L491665,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,NO! I could never hurt anyone!
90622,L491664,u2657,m173,MOM,"Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!"
90623,L491663,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
90624,L491662,u2657,m173,MOM,Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
90625,L491661,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,...Browsing.
90626,L491660,u2657,m173,MOM,"Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?"
90627,L491377,u2657,m173,MOM,"Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary."
90628,L491376,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe."
90629,L491366,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
90630,L491365,u2657,m173,MOM,You want me to keep that under the table for you?
90631,L491364,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!"
90632,L491363,u2657,m173,MOM,"Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?"
90633,L491228,u2657,m173,MOM,"I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey."
90634,L491227,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"That's like your car, Beverly,"
90635,L491143,u2657,m173,MOM,Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
90636,L491142,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning."
90637,L491141,u2657,m173,MOM,Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
90638,L491140,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
90639,L491139,u2657,m173,MOM,"Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering."
90640,L491138,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"Beverly, are you alright?"
90641,L491167,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,"Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA."
90642,L491166,u2657,m173,MOM,"No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins."
90643,L491165,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,"Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?"
90644,L491164,u2657,m173,MOM,Certainly not!
90645,L491163,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
90646,L491162,u2657,m173,MOM,He is assistant manager of a video shop...
90647,L491161,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
90648,L491160,u2657,m173,MOM,"What is it, Mr. Stubbins?"
90649,L491159,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,There is one big problem though.
90650,L491158,u2657,m173,MOM,He's a good boy.
90651,L491157,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
90652,L491156,u2657,m173,MOM,Bon Appetit!
90653,L491155,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,"Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat."
90654,L491154,u2657,m173,MOM,"Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked."
90655,L491153,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,"Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher."
90656,L491152,u2657,m173,MOM,Right here!
90657,L491151,u2660,m173,MR. STUBBINS,Mrs... Sutphin?
90658,L491293,u2664,m173,SCOTTY,"Now, here's a babe!"
90659,L491292,u2657,m173,MOM,"Murder, honey."
90660,L491289,u2657,m173,MOM,"From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user."
90661,L491288,u2664,m173,SCOTTY,SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
90662,L491187,u2657,m173,MOM,Yes you are.
90663,L491186,u2664,m173,SCOTTY,Are we leaving?
90664,L491185,u2657,m173,MOM,You forgot something...
90665,L491184,u2664,m173,SCOTTY,"Man, that one made me puke!"
90666,L491176,u2664,m173,SCOTTY,"Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin."
90667,L491175,u2657,m173,MOM,"I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!"
90668,L491433,u2663,m173,MRS. STERNER,"We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!"
90669,L491432,u2659,m173,MR. STERNER,"What is it, Betty?"
90670,L491429,u2663,m173,MRS. STERNER,How to send a bill!!
90671,L491428,u2659,m173,MR. STERNER,What's he know?
90672,L491427,u2663,m173,MRS. STERNER,Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
90673,L491426,u2659,m173,MR. STERNER,I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
90674,L491425,u2663,m173,MRS. STERNER,What was that?
90675,L491362,u2665,m173,VENDOR,"Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it..."
90676,L491361,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,I'll take this instead.
90677,L491360,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods!"
90678,L491359,u2665,m173,VENDOR,That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
90679,L491358,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,I'll give you fifty cents.
90680,L491357,u2665,m173,VENDOR,"Yes, ma'am, it is."
90681,L491356,u2661,m173,MRS. ACKERMAN,"Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped."
90682,L496342,u2667,m174,AUGUST,"Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot."
90683,L496341,u2685,m174,RADEAU,That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
90684,L496340,u2667,m174,AUGUST,Yeah - sure.
90685,L496339,u2685,m174,RADEAU,"Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice."
90686,L496338,u2667,m174,AUGUST,Sure I do.
90687,L496337,u2685,m174,RADEAU,"You know who I am, August?"
90688,L496403,u2667,m174,AUGUST,Listen
90689,L496402,u2675,m174,MARY,You could go and open the door.
90690,L496401,u2667,m174,AUGUST,We can't stand here all night.
90691,L496400,u2675,m174,MARY,No.
90692,L496399,u2667,m174,AUGUST,I'd like to get out of here.
90693,L496398,u2675,m174,MARY,"It's only a little way, Mr. August."
90694,L496396,u2675,m174,MARY,No.
90695,L496395,u2667,m174,AUGUST,Let's get out of here.
90696,L496394,u2675,m174,MARY,Yes.
90697,L496393,u2667,m174,AUGUST,You scared?
90698,L496392,u2667,m174,AUGUST,It's the last door at the end of this hall.
90699,L496391,u2675,m174,MARY,Which room is it?
90700,L496390,u2667,m174,AUGUST,I don't like this.
90701,L496389,u2667,m174,AUGUST,I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
90702,L496388,u2675,m174,MARY,"If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there."
90703,L496387,u2667,m174,AUGUST,"Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door."
90704,L496386,u2675,m174,MARY,Can we go there now?
90705,L496385,u2667,m174,AUGUST,You can't tell.
90706,L496384,u2675,m174,MARY,You think my sister is there?
90707,L496383,u2667,m174,AUGUST,That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
90708,L496382,u2675,m174,MARY,Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
90709,L496381,u2667,m174,AUGUST,That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
90710,L496380,u2675,m174,MARY,Yes. She bought my sister's business.
90711,L496379,u2667,m174,AUGUST,Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
90712,L496378,u2675,m174,MARY,Where?
90713,L496377,u2667,m174,AUGUST,"Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister."
90714,L496376,u2675,m174,MARY,"Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -"
90715,L496375,u2667,m174,AUGUST,I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
90716,L496335,u2675,m174,MARY,I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
90717,L496334,u2667,m174,AUGUST,"Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee"
90718,L496333,u2675,m174,MARY,You can?
90719,L496332,u2667,m174,AUGUST,"The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours."
90720,L496953,u2668,m174,BRUNS,You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
90721,L496952,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,No.
90722,L496951,u2668,m174,BRUNS,Drink.
90723,L496950,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
90724,L496937,u2668,m174,BRUNS,"It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty."
90725,L496936,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,When I wanted to.
90726,L496933,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,No.
90727,L496932,u2668,m174,BRUNS,"Then, you also understand that you must die."
90728,L496931,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,"Yes, I understand."
90729,L496930,u2668,m174,BRUNS,"The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?"
90730,L496446,u2678,m174,MISS SUMMERS,No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
90731,L496445,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
90732,L496444,u2678,m174,MISS SUMMERS,I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
90733,L496443,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,Yes.
90734,L496442,u2678,m174,MISS SUMMERS,Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
90735,L496440,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,Thank you.
90736,L496439,u2678,m174,MISS SUMMERS,"Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?"
90737,L496478,u2671,m174,GREGORY,What circumstances?
90738,L496477,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,"She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances."
90739,L496476,u2671,m174,GREGORY,But tell me --
90740,L496475,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,"Oh, as beautiful as ever."
90741,L496474,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Tell me, how is Jacqueline?"
90742,L496473,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,"For the time being, I imagine that must do."
90743,L496472,u2671,m174,GREGORY,About forty-five dollars.
90744,L496471,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,How much have you got?
90745,L496470,u2671,m174,GREGORY,I haven't got that much in cash.
90746,L496469,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,She can only use cash.
90747,L496468,u2671,m174,GREGORY,I'll give you a check.
90748,L496467,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,She could use a hundred dollars.
90749,L496466,u2671,m174,GREGORY,How much does she want?
90750,L496464,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!"
90751,L496463,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,"Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her."
90752,L496462,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,"As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician."
90753,L496461,u2671,m174,GREGORY,It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
90754,L496460,u2671,m174,GREGORY,You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
90755,L496459,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
90756,L496456,u2671,m174,GREGORY,What sort of danger?
90757,L496455,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,"I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her."
90758,L496454,u2671,m174,GREGORY,If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
90759,L496453,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
90760,L496452,u2671,m174,GREGORY,I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
90761,L496451,u2669,m174,DR. JUDD,I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
90762,L496690,u2675,m174,MARY,What is it?
90763,L496689,u2670,m174,FRANCES,I ought to know.
90764,L496688,u2675,m174,MARY,"Do you know what this is, Frances?"
90765,L496687,u2675,m174,MARY,Thank you.
90766,L496686,u2670,m174,FRANCES,"The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair."
90767,L496683,u2670,m174,FRANCES,I guess most people are.
90768,L496682,u2675,m174,MARY,It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
90769,L496681,u2675,m174,MARY,What does she do with herself after business hours?
90770,L496680,u2670,m174,FRANCES,She's a pretty good sort.
90771,L496679,u2675,m174,MARY,She seems rather an odd woman to me.
90772,L496678,u2670,m174,FRANCES,Redi's all right.
90773,L496677,u2675,m174,MARY,Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
90774,L496676,u2670,m174,FRANCES,"Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby."
90775,L496675,u2675,m174,MARY,But I like teaching school.
90776,L496674,u2670,m174,FRANCES,I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
90777,L496285,u2675,m174,MARY,I'll try there.
90778,L496284,u2670,m174,FRANCES,It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
90779,L496283,u2675,m174,MARY,"""The Dante?"""
90780,L496282,u2670,m174,FRANCES,"Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	""The Dante."""
90781,L496281,u2675,m174,MARY,I can't understand it at all.
90782,L496280,u2670,m174,FRANCES,Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
90783,L496279,u2675,m174,MARY,I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
90784,L496278,u2670,m174,FRANCES,I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
90785,L496277,u2670,m174,FRANCES,"You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?"
90786,L496276,u2675,m174,MARY,I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
90787,L496275,u2670,m174,FRANCES,How's Miss Jacqueline?
90788,L496274,u2675,m174,MARY,"Hello, Frances."
90789,L496273,u2670,m174,FRANCES,"Why, Mary --"
90790,L496762,u2670,m174,FRANCES,Yes.
90791,L496761,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding."
90792,L496706,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
90793,L496705,u2670,m174,FRANCES,She showed me a drawing.
90794,L496704,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,What did she want to know?
90795,L496703,u2670,m174,FRANCES,No. She asked about the trademark.
90796,L496702,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,And that was all?
90797,L496701,u2670,m174,FRANCES,She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
90798,L496700,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions."
90799,L496699,u2670,m174,FRANCES,Nothing.
90800,L496698,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,What were you talking about?
90801,L496697,u2670,m174,FRANCES,I did her hair.
90802,L496696,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,What did she want?
90803,L497015,u2675,m174,MARY,"No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it..."
90804,L497014,u2671,m174,GREGORY,I know  I shouldn't have told you
90805,L497013,u2675,m174,MARY,"I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again...."
90806,L497012,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently."
90807,L497011,u2675,m174,MARY,Yes.
90808,L497010,u2671,m174,GREGORY,No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
90809,L497008,u2671,m174,GREGORY,It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
90810,L497007,u2675,m174,MARY,Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
90811,L497006,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -"
90812,L496886,u2675,m174,MARY,Good night.
90813,L496885,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary."
90814,L496877,u2675,m174,MARY,"You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener."
90815,L496876,u2671,m174,GREGORY,I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
90816,L496875,u2675,m174,MARY,"It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee."
90817,L496874,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
90818,L496873,u2675,m174,MARY,Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
90819,L496812,u2675,m174,MARY,We've tried so long to find her.
90820,L496811,u2671,m174,GREGORY,She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
90821,L496560,u2675,m174,MARY,What things? Why?
90822,L496559,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things."
90823,L496558,u2675,m174,MARY,You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
90824,L496551,u2675,m174,MARY,A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
90825,L496550,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Who the devil is he?
90826,L496549,u2675,m174,MARY,Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
90827,L496548,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
90828,L496496,u2671,m174,GREGORY,There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
90829,L496495,u2675,m174,MARY,"Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --"
90830,L496494,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories."
90831,L496493,u2675,m174,MARY,You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
90832,L496492,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Oh, I'm making investigations."
90833,L496491,u2675,m174,MARY,What have you done about Irving August?
90834,L496483,u2675,m174,MARY,"Well, I'm glad you came to see me."
90835,L496482,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -"
90836,L496481,u2675,m174,MARY,"What brought you down here, Greg?"
90837,L496437,u2675,m174,MARY,Yes.
90838,L496436,u2671,m174,GREGORY,The people at the restaurant?
90839,L496435,u2675,m174,MARY,Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
90840,L496434,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room."
90841,L496433,u2675,m174,MARY,I'd like that.
90842,L496432,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher."
90843,L496431,u2675,m174,MARY,A job?
90844,L496430,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you."
90845,L496429,u2671,m174,GREGORY,I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
90846,L496428,u2675,m174,MARY,But you have treated me that way.
90847,L496427,u2671,m174,GREGORY,I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
90848,L496425,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Drink your milk.
90849,L496424,u2675,m174,MARY,He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
90850,L496423,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream."
90851,L496422,u2675,m174,MARY,I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
90852,L496421,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"The important thing is, the police won't believe you."
90853,L496420,u2675,m174,MARY,But you do believe me?
90854,L496419,u2671,m174,GREGORY,This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
90855,L496374,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Goodnight, Mary."
90856,L496373,u2675,m174,MARY,Thank you.. .goodnight.
90857,L496372,u2671,m174,GREGORY,You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
90858,L496371,u2675,m174,MARY,But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
90859,L496370,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Good.
90860,L496369,u2675,m174,MARY,Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
90861,L496365,u2675,m174,MARY,I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
90862,L496364,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster."
90863,L496363,u2675,m174,MARY,Weren't you afraid?
90864,L496362,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room."
90865,L496361,u2675,m174,MARY,Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
90866,L496360,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her."
90867,L496358,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much."
90868,L496357,u2675,m174,MARY,Why?
90869,L496356,u2671,m174,GREGORY,But I'd give a great deal to know.
90870,L496355,u2675,m174,MARY,Then you know where Jacqueline is?
90871,L496354,u2671,m174,GREGORY,The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
90872,L496353,u2675,m174,MARY,No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
90873,L496352,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,"
90874,L496892,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Not from me.
90875,L496891,u2673,m174,JASON,She'll have to know some time.
90876,L496890,u2673,m174,JASON,That you love Mary.
90877,L496889,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Let her know what?
90878,L496823,u2673,m174,JASON,Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
90879,L496822,u2671,m174,GREGORY,What's that?
90880,L496819,u2673,m174,JASON,I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
90881,L496818,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Could you find him?
90882,L496817,u2673,m174,JASON,We could tell him.
90883,L496816,u2671,m174,GREGORY,He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
90884,L496815,u2673,m174,JASON,I don't know.
90885,L496814,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Do you think he knows about this?
90886,L496584,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Well, that's illuminating."
90887,L496583,u2673,m174,JASON,I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
90888,L496582,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?"
90889,L496581,u2673,m174,JASON,"This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here."
90890,L496580,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Well?
90891,L496576,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us."
90892,L496575,u2673,m174,JASON,"Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?"
90893,L496574,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense."
90894,L496573,u2673,m174,JASON,But I understand her. That may be more important.
90895,L496572,u2671,m174,GREGORY,You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
90896,L496571,u2673,m174,JASON,But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
90897,L496570,u2671,m174,GREGORY,Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
90898,L496569,u2673,m174,JASON,But I'm not joking.
90899,L496568,u2671,m174,GREGORY,"I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag."
90900,L496567,u2673,m174,JASON,I'm going to find your sister.
90901,L497004,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,You will die.
90902,L497003,u2676,m174,MIMI,I don't know.
90903,L497002,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,And then?
90904,L497001,u2676,m174,MIMI,"I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do."
90905,L497000,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,Why wait?
90906,L496999,u2676,m174,MIMI,I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
90907,L496998,u2676,m174,MIMI,I'm afraid.
90908,L496997,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
90909,L496996,u2676,m174,MIMI,"Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying."
90910,L496995,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,No!
90911,L496994,u2676,m174,MIMI,I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
90912,L496993,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,Who are you?
90913,L496900,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,Yes.
90914,L496899,u2675,m174,MARY,You'll be all right?
90915,L496898,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,I won't get lonely.
90916,L496897,u2675,m174,MARY,"If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me."
90917,L496896,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,Good-bye.
90918,L496895,u2675,m174,MARY,"Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three."
90919,L496868,u2672,m174,JACQUELINE,You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
90920,L496867,u2675,m174,MARY,"Please, Jacqueline."
90921,L497022,u2673,m174,JASON,"Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you - you're off to work."
90922,L497021,u2675,m174,MARY,I understand.
90923,L497020,u2673,m174,JASON,"Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - ""My courage like a white plume""  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,"
90924,L497017,u2675,m174,MARY,I keep telling myself that.
90925,L497016,u2673,m174,JASON,"I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way."
90926,L496966,u2673,m174,JASON,They may have been friends of hers.
90927,L496965,u2675,m174,MARY,Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
90928,L496964,u2673,m174,JASON,"What's wrong, Mary?"
90929,L496963,u2675,m174,MARY,I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
90930,L496808,u2675,m174,MARY,He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
90931,L496807,u2673,m174,JASON,"He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him."
90932,L496806,u2675,m174,MARY,And Gregory -- he loves her.
90933,L496805,u2673,m174,JASON,If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
90934,L496804,u2675,m174,MARY,I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
90935,L496803,u2673,m174,JASON,And you believe that?
90936,L496802,u2675,m174,MARY,Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
90937,L496801,u2673,m174,JASON,You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
90938,L496800,u2675,m174,MARY,It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
90939,L496799,u2673,m174,JASON,I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
90940,L496798,u2673,m174,JASON,"I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend."
90941,L496797,u2675,m174,MARY,"Don't make me tell you, Jason."
90942,L496796,u2673,m174,JASON,"It isn't that -- you said, ""have to go."" What could compel you --"
90943,L496795,u2673,m174,JASON,But you're happy here -- you like your work -
90944,L496794,u2675,m174,MARY,I have to go -
90945,L496793,u2673,m174,JASON,I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
90946,L496792,u2675,m174,MARY,"Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by."
90947,L496791,u2673,m174,JASON,It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
90948,L496790,u2675,m174,MARY,It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
90949,L496789,u2673,m174,JASON,My window - - through which I see the world.
90950,L496786,u2673,m174,JASON,It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it  to know me better.
90951,L496785,u2675,m174,MARY,"But it's a small room, Jason."
90952,L496784,u2673,m174,JASON,I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
90953,L496672,u2673,m174,JASON,Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
90954,L496671,u2675,m174,MARY,I can imagine.
90955,L496670,u2673,m174,JASON,Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
90956,L496669,u2675,m174,MARY,Devil worshippers!
90957,L496668,u2673,m174,JASON,"I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --"
90958,L496667,u2675,m174,MARY,It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
90959,L496666,u2673,m174,JASON,Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
90960,L496665,u2675,m174,MARY,"I'm at sea, Jason."
90961,L496664,u2673,m174,JASON,"That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked ""perfect"" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since."
90962,L496663,u2675,m174,MARY,I don't know.
90963,L496662,u2673,m174,JASON,"But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?"
90964,L496661,u2675,m174,MARY,I don't think that's so revealing.
90965,L496660,u2673,m174,JASON,I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
90966,L496659,u2675,m174,MARY,But you're always at the library.
90967,L496658,u2673,m174,JASON,I have been at the library.
90968,L496652,u2673,m174,JASON,I have something even better.
90969,L496651,u2675,m174,MARY,"It's terribly sweet of you, Jason."
90970,L496634,u2675,m174,MARY,I want you to look for Jacqueline.
90971,L496633,u2673,m174,JASON,"Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?"
90972,L496632,u2675,m174,MARY,And you knew he'd be here.
90973,L496631,u2673,m174,JASON,Yes.
90974,L496630,u2675,m174,MARY,At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
90975,L496566,u2673,m174,JASON,"You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious."
90976,L496565,u2675,m174,MARY,"Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- ""your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."""
90977,L496315,u2673,m174,JASON,Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
90978,L496314,u2675,m174,MARY,Were you going to make a suggestion?
90979,L496557,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,"But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table."
90980,L496556,u2673,m174,JASON,"We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose."
90981,L496555,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
90982,L496545,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,"Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine."
90983,L496544,u2673,m174,JASON,"What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?"
90984,L496542,u2673,m174,JASON,"Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies."
90985,L496541,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,"Jason, my pet"
90986,L496317,u2673,m174,JASON,"I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say."
90987,L496316,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,"Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way."
90988,L496648,u2677,m174,MISS GOTTSCHALK,"Well, since, you're over twenty one"
90989,L496647,u2673,m174,JASON,I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
90990,L496646,u2677,m174,MISS GOTTSCHALK,"Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission."
90991,L496645,u2677,m174,MISS GOTTSCHALK,"No, not at all, Mr. Jason."
90992,L496644,u2673,m174,JASON,"Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?"
90993,L496643,u2677,m174,MISS GOTTSCHALK,"It's here, too."
90994,L496642,u2673,m174,JASON,"Yes, Dr. Louis Judd."
90995,L496641,u2677,m174,MISS GOTTSCHALK,And the other was Judd?
90996,L496639,u2677,m174,MISS GOTTSCHALK,Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
90997,L496638,u2673,m174,JASON,I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
90998,L496637,u2677,m174,MISS GOTTSCHALK,"Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?"
90999,L496969,u2674,m174,JUDD,They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
91000,L496968,u2673,m174,JASON,What?
91001,L496961,u2673,m174,JASON,I'd like that.
91002,L496960,u2674,m174,JUDD,"If you like, I'll go with you to dinner."
91003,L496946,u2673,m174,JASON,It might have.
91004,L496945,u2674,m174,JUDD,"A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?"
91005,L496944,u2673,m174,JASON,She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
91006,L496943,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?"
91007,L496894,u2673,m174,JASON,Perhaps
91008,L496893,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you."
91009,L496888,u2673,m174,JASON,I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
91010,L496887,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?"
91011,L496848,u2674,m174,JUDD,I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
91012,L496847,u2673,m174,JASON,Perhaps.
91013,L496846,u2674,m174,JUDD,No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
91014,L496845,u2673,m174,JASON,I think it's time.
91015,L496844,u2674,m174,JUDD,"Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous."
91016,L496843,u2673,m174,JASON,You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
91017,L496842,u2674,m174,JUDD,Tell me what?
91018,L496841,u2673,m174,JASON,Yes. When I tell you.
91019,L496840,u2674,m174,JUDD,You don't expect me to do that do you?
91020,L496839,u2673,m174,JASON,Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
91021,L496838,u2674,m174,JUDD,I'd forgotten.
91022,L496837,u2673,m174,JASON,Wait - there is that other favor.
91023,L496836,u2673,m174,JASON,Why not let your publisher judge that?
91024,L496835,u2674,m174,JUDD,I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
91025,L496834,u2673,m174,JASON,It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
91026,L496833,u2674,m174,JUDD,And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
91027,L496832,u2673,m174,JASON,I should like people to read what I've written.
91028,L496831,u2674,m174,JUDD,"This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility."
91029,L496829,u2674,m174,JUDD,"It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary."
91030,L496828,u2673,m174,JASON,Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
91031,L496827,u2674,m174,JUDD,"Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet."
91032,L496826,u2673,m174,JASON,Uhhuh.
91033,L496825,u2674,m174,JUDD,Following me to find Jacqueline?
91034,L496616,u2674,m174,JUDD,After that wonderful first book - after all the adulation and the good reviews?
91035,L496615,u2673,m174,JASON,I've lost my knack.
91036,L496614,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years."
91037,L496613,u2673,m174,JASON,I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
91038,L496612,u2674,m174,JUDD,What was she to you?
91039,L496611,u2674,m174,JUDD,She was my patient.
91040,L496610,u2673,m174,JASON,Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
91041,L496609,u2674,m174,JUDD,But why come to me?
91042,L496608,u2673,m174,JASON,See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
91043,L496606,u2674,m174,JUDD,"My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell."
91044,L496605,u2673,m174,JASON,I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
91045,L496604,u2674,m174,JUDD,What a peculiar question.
91046,L496603,u2673,m174,JASON,Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
91047,L496971,u2674,m174,JUDD,I don't know.
91048,L496970,u2675,m174,MARY,Would they hurt her?
91049,L496879,u2675,m174,MARY,It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
91050,L496878,u2674,m174,JUDD,Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
91051,L496520,u2674,m174,JUDD,Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
91052,L496519,u2675,m174,MARY,Cloven hoof?
91053,L496518,u2674,m174,JUDD,It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
91054,L496517,u2674,m174,JUDD,"If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time."
91055,L496516,u2675,m174,MARY,You know where she is?
91056,L496515,u2674,m174,JUDD,Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
91057,L496514,u2674,m174,JUDD,"Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister."
91058,L496513,u2675,m174,MARY,Dr. Judd?
91059,L496918,u2674,m174,JUDD,"No, she's with her sister,"
91060,L496917,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
91061,L496916,u2674,m174,JUDD,And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
91062,L496915,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
91063,L496914,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I'm very, very serious."
91064,L496913,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
91065,L496911,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
91066,L496910,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power."
91067,L496909,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,I never thought you did.
91068,L496908,u2674,m174,JUDD,"But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good."
91069,L496907,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,"We always knew you'd come to us, Louis."
91070,L496906,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you."
91071,L496905,u2674,m174,JUDD,No. She's no longer under my care.
91072,L496904,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,Is it about Jacqueline?
91073,L496731,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,"You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis."
91074,L496730,u2674,m174,JUDD,It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
91075,L496729,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,"No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm."
91076,L496728,u2674,m174,JUDD,Unless what?
91077,L496727,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,"Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless..."
91078,L496726,u2674,m174,JUDD,"A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you."
91079,L496725,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,I was a great dancer...
91080,L496724,u2674,m174,JUDD,"A gay lot - Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you..."
91081,L496723,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
91082,L496722,u2674,m174,JUDD,I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
91083,L496721,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,"I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize."
91084,L496720,u2674,m174,JUDD,I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
91085,L496719,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
91086,L496718,u2674,m174,JUDD,But you would like to know where she is?
91087,L496717,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,I haven't said anything of the sort.
91088,L496716,u2674,m174,JUDD,"Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?"
91089,L496715,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
91090,L496714,u2674,m174,JUDD,I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
91091,L496713,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
91092,L496712,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?"
91093,L496711,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,It seems right to us.
91094,L496710,u2674,m174,JUDD,I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
91095,L496709,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,One believes - it's like any other religion...
91096,L496708,u2674,m174,JUDD,"I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie."
91097,L496746,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline."
91098,L496745,u2675,m174,MARY,I don't believe it.
91099,L496744,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding."
91100,L496743,u2675,m174,MARY,"I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at."
91101,L496742,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary."
91102,L496741,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
91103,L496740,u2675,m174,MARY,Why?
91104,L496739,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline."
91105,L496738,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
91106,L496737,u2675,m174,MARY,I'll be out in a minute.
91107,L496736,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"This is Mrs. Redi, Mary."
91108,L496735,u2675,m174,MARY,Yes.
91109,L496695,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,That's too bad.
91110,L496694,u2675,m174,MARY,I'm afraid not.
91111,L496272,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"Thank you, my dear."
91112,L496271,u2675,m174,MARY,I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
91113,L496270,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you."
91114,L496269,u2675,m174,MARY,"There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?"
91115,L496268,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
91116,L496267,u2675,m174,MARY,I didn't know.
91117,L496266,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now."
91118,L496265,u2675,m174,MARY,"Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?"
91119,L496263,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,I'm afraid not.
91120,L496262,u2675,m174,MARY,But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
91121,L496302,u2675,m174,MARY,"Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister."
91122,L496301,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
91123,L496300,u2675,m174,MARY,"You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?"
91124,L496299,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,"Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat."
91125,L496298,u2675,m174,MARY,But she was here?
91126,L496297,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,She's not been here for a long time.
91127,L496296,u2675,m174,MARY,"Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline."
91128,L496293,u2683,m174,MRS. ROMARI,Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
91129,L496292,u2675,m174,MARY,Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
91130,L496252,u2681,m174,MRS. LOWOOD,"I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here."
91131,L496251,u2675,m174,MARY,"But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --"
91132,L496249,u2675,m174,MARY,Of course.
91133,L496248,u2681,m174,MRS. LOWOOD,"I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil."
91134,L496247,u2675,m174,MARY,Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
91135,L496246,u2681,m174,MRS. LOWOOD,"We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister."
91136,L496245,u2675,m174,MARY,Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
91137,L496244,u2681,m174,MRS. LOWOOD,That makes it all the more difficult
91138,L496242,u2681,m174,MRS. LOWOOD,"Have you any other relatives, Mary?"
91139,L496241,u2675,m174,MARY,"No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often."
91140,L496240,u2681,m174,MRS. LOWOOD,Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
91141,L496307,u2675,m174,MARY,What did he say?
91142,L496306,u2686,m174,ROMARI,Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
91143,L496304,u2675,m174,MARY,Please.
91144,L496303,u2686,m174,ROMARI,"No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door."
91145,L496290,u2675,m174,MARY,She's very beautiful.
91146,L496289,u2686,m174,ROMARI,I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
91147,L496288,u2675,m174,MARY,I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
91148,L496287,u2686,m174,ROMARI,Yes?
91149,L496286,u2675,m174,MARY,I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
91150,L496929,u2684,m174,NANCY,When?
91151,L496928,u2675,m174,MARY,I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
91152,L496927,u2684,m174,NANCY,What?
91153,L496926,u2675,m174,MARY,Because I have something very important to do.
91154,L496925,u2684,m174,NANCY,Why
91155,L496924,u2675,m174,MARY,"Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while."
91156,L496498,u2675,m174,MARY,"No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes."
91157,L496497,u2684,m174,NANCY,Is it fifteen minutes yet?
91158,L496490,u2675,m174,MARY,Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
91159,L496489,u2684,m174,NANCY,"Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting."
91160,L496780,u2679,m174,MR. BRUNS,Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
91161,L496779,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
91162,L496776,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,What about Judd -- he knows about us.
91163,L496775,u2679,m174,MR. BRUNS,It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
91164,L496772,u2679,m174,MR. BRUNS,I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
91165,L496771,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"But she told him, Frances. She told him about us."
91166,L496766,u2679,m174,MR. BRUNS,"I can quote that too; ""Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."""
91167,L496765,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,But he also wrote --
91168,L496764,u2679,m174,MR. BRUNS,"I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. ""We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."""
91169,L496763,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
91170,L496939,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,It won't hurt.
91171,L496938,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little."
91172,L496935,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to."
91173,L496934,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,"Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little."
91174,L496752,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
91175,L496751,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
91176,L496750,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
91177,L496748,u2680,m174,MRS. CORTEZ,We haven't even begun tea yet.
91178,L496747,u2682,m174,MRS. REDI,"I'm sorry to be late, Natalie."
91179,L497959,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm okay. It's okay.
91180,L497958,u2687,m175,ANN,Graham...
91181,L497955,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91182,L497954,u2687,m175,ANN,I want to touch you.
91183,L497952,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again."
91184,L497951,u2687,m175,ANN,But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
91185,L497950,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say ""That's why!"" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way."
91186,L497949,u2687,m175,ANN,I want to know why you are the way you are!
91187,L497948,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?"
91188,L497947,u2687,m175,ANN,You're not answering me.
91189,L497946,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of."
91190,L497945,u2687,m175,ANN,Why are you ashamed?
91191,L497944,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
91192,L497943,u2687,m175,ANN,Come on!!
91193,L497941,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't care.
91194,L497940,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I don't find this ""turning the tables"" thing very interesting --"
91195,L497939,u2687,m175,ANN,I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
91196,L497938,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I can't tell you like this.
91197,L497937,u2687,m175,ANN,"""Because""? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you ""how does it feel""? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?"
91198,L497936,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Because.
91199,L497935,u2687,m175,ANN,Why not?
91200,L497934,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Don't do that.
91201,L497932,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine."
91202,L497931,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember."
91203,L497929,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?"
91204,L497928,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything."
91205,L497927,u2687,m175,ANN,"Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something."
91206,L497926,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
91207,L497925,u2687,m175,ANN,"Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?"
91208,L497924,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I don't know.
91209,L497923,u2687,m175,ANN,"Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?"
91210,L497922,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Possibly.
91211,L497921,u2687,m175,ANN,Like maybe a big part?
91212,L497920,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91213,L497919,u2687,m175,ANN,But that was part of it?
91214,L497918,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Not entirely.
91215,L497917,u2687,m175,ANN,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?"
91216,L497916,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I don't know. Possibly.
91217,L497915,u2687,m175,ANN,But you're planning to be?
91218,L497914,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91219,L497913,u2687,m175,ANN,You mean you're still in contact with her?
91220,L497912,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91221,L497911,u2687,m175,ANN,Who? Elizabeth?
91222,L497910,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
91223,L497909,u2687,m175,ANN,"But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --"
91224,L497908,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --"
91225,L497907,u2687,m175,ANN,But I don't understand --
91226,L497906,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I've told you.
91227,L497905,u2687,m175,ANN,Why not?
91228,L497904,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I can't.
91229,L497903,u2687,m175,ANN,I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
91230,L497902,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?"
91231,L497901,u2687,m175,ANN,"So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?"
91232,L497900,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,That's very flattering.
91233,L497899,u2687,m175,ANN,But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
91234,L497898,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I... I can't answer that precisely.
91235,L497897,u2687,m175,ANN,But if you were?
91236,L497896,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm not in love with you.
91237,L497895,u2687,m175,ANN,"If you were in love with me, would you?"
91238,L497894,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm not planning on it.
91239,L497893,u2687,m175,ANN,You're really never going to make love again?
91240,L497892,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!"
91241,L497891,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
91242,L497890,u2687,m175,ANN,"God, I m so mad at him!!"
91243,L497889,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"No, you're not."
91244,L497888,u2687,m175,ANN,I'm babbling.
91245,L497887,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Interesting analogy.
91246,L497886,u2687,m175,ANN,"Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables."
91247,L497885,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,And you feel the same way with John?
91248,L497884,u2687,m175,ANN,"Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself."
91249,L497883,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Subtlety?
91250,L497882,u2687,m175,ANN,"I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no..."
91251,L497881,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?"
91252,L497880,u2687,m175,ANN,Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
91253,L497879,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
91254,L497878,u2687,m175,ANN,"I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong."
91255,L497877,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?"
91256,L497876,u2687,m175,ANN,Don't you get lonely?
91257,L497875,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
91258,L497874,u2687,m175,ANN,And now you can?
91259,L497873,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions."
91260,L497872,u2687,m175,ANN,How come?
91261,L497871,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
91262,L497870,u2687,m175,ANN,So you lied to her?
91263,L497869,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always ""recovering""."
91264,L497868,u2687,m175,ANN,What was the problem?
91265,L497867,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem."
91266,L497866,u2687,m175,ANN,So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
91267,L497865,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Her name was Elizabeth.
91268,L497864,u2687,m175,ANN,Who was the last person you had sex with?
91269,L497863,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91270,L497862,u2687,m175,ANN,So you have had sex.
91271,L497861,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,That's correct.
91272,L497860,u2687,m175,ANN,You said you weren't always impotent.
91273,L497859,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Can't.
91274,L497858,u2687,m175,ANN,Can't or won't?
91275,L497857,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all."
91276,L497856,u2687,m175,ANN,Why not?
91277,L497855,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91278,L497854,u2687,m175,ANN,On tape?
91279,L497853,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91280,L497852,u2687,m175,ANN,"If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?"
91281,L497851,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91282,L497850,u2687,m175,ANN,"I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?"
91283,L497849,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you."
91284,L497848,u2687,m175,ANN,Have you fantasized about me?
91285,L497847,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91286,L497846,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,About me?
91287,L497845,u2687,m175,ANN,I fantasized about you.
91288,L497844,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,About who?
91289,L497843,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91290,L497842,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,So you do fantasize?
91291,L497841,u2687,m175,ANN,"I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has."
91292,L497840,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
91293,L497839,u2687,m175,ANN,"Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!"
91294,L497838,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Why?
91295,L497837,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!"
91296,L497836,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
91297,L497835,u2687,m175,ANN,No.
91298,L497834,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Do you want me to stop?
91299,L497833,u2687,m175,ANN,I guess not.
91300,L497832,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about."
91301,L497831,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yes, I have. I will."
91302,L497830,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?"
91303,L497829,u2687,m175,ANN,"I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this..."
91304,L497825,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
91305,L497824,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91306,L497823,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Did you have sex before you were married?
91307,L497820,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Absolutely not.
91308,L497819,u2687,m175,ANN,Is he going to see this?
91309,L497818,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
91310,L497817,u2687,m175,ANN,You don't know what I'm thinking.
91311,L497808,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Does he go down on you?
91312,L497807,u2687,m175,ANN,Sometimes. Afterward.
91313,L497806,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91314,L497805,u2687,m175,ANN,When we're making love?
91315,L497804,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Do you talk to him?
91316,L497798,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"You are married, correct?"
91317,L497797,u2687,m175,ANN,Ann Bishop Millaney.
91318,L497796,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Tell me your name.
91319,L497756,u2687,m175,ANN,Ann Bishop Millaney.
91320,L497755,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Tell me your name.
91321,L497754,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91322,L497753,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,It won't. Are you ready?
91323,L497752,u2687,m175,ANN,What will you do when the money runs out?
91324,L497751,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I have money.
91325,L497750,u2687,m175,ANN,"How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment."
91326,L497749,u2687,m175,ANN,Then do it.
91327,L497748,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Load a new tape, turn the camera on."
91328,L497747,u2687,m175,ANN,What do you have to do to get ready?
91329,L497746,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,That's a good question.
91330,L497745,u2687,m175,ANN,What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
91331,L497744,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind."
91332,L497743,u2687,m175,ANN,What difference does it make why I do it?
91333,L497742,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
91334,L497741,u2687,m175,ANN,Don't you want to make one?
91335,L497740,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Do you think that's such a good idea?
91336,L497736,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this."
91337,L497735,u2687,m175,ANN,Why not?
91338,L497734,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you."
91339,L497733,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall."
91340,L497732,u2687,m175,ANN,Why didn't you tell me?
91341,L497731,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,She said it on her tape.
91342,L497730,u2687,m175,ANN,How did you know?
91343,L497729,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91344,L497728,u2687,m175,ANN,You know?
91345,L497727,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I know.
91346,L497726,u2687,m175,ANN,"John and Cynthia have been... ""fucking""."
91347,L497724,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I know.
91348,L497723,u2687,m175,ANN,I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
91349,L497389,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yes, I do."
91350,L497388,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Maybe you want to go.
91351,L497387,u2687,m175,ANN,This is just... so...
91352,L497386,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm sorry this came up.
91353,L497385,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't... why... why do you do this?
91354,L497384,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"No, not to me, for me, for the camera."
91355,L497383,u2687,m175,ANN,To you?
91356,L497382,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
91357,L497381,u2687,m175,ANN,And they just answer them?
91358,L497380,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91359,L497379,u2687,m175,ANN,You just ask them questions?
91360,L497378,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of."
91361,L497377,u2687,m175,ANN,Like what?
91362,L497376,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Everything about sex.
91363,L497375,u2687,m175,ANN,What about sex?
91364,L497374,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91365,L497373,u2687,m175,ANN,About sex?
91366,L497372,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"The... interviews are about sex, Ann."
91367,L497371,u2687,m175,ANN,What... what are these interviews about?
91368,L497370,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
91369,L497369,u2687,m175,ANN,Why not?
91370,L497368,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91371,L497367,u2687,m175,ANN,Can we look at one?
91372,L497366,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91373,L497365,u2687,m175,ANN,All of these are interviews?
91374,L497364,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
91375,L497362,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Not really.
91376,L497361,u2687,m175,ANN,You went out with her?
91377,L497360,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
91378,L497359,u2687,m175,ANN,"Donna. On this tape it says ""Donna""."
91379,L497358,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Donna?
91380,L497357,u2687,m175,ANN,Who's Donna?
91381,L497356,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal."
91382,L497355,u2687,m175,ANN,What kind of personal project?
91383,L497354,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,It's a personal project I'm working on.
91384,L497353,u2687,m175,ANN,I can see that. What are they?
91385,L497352,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Videotapes.
91386,L497351,u2687,m175,ANN,What are these?
91387,L497348,u2687,m175,ANN,Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
91388,L497347,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe."
91389,L497346,u2687,m175,ANN,I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
91390,L497345,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Nothing I can't finish later.
91391,L497344,u2687,m175,ANN,Are you in the middle of something?
91392,L497343,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Ann. Hello.
91393,L497342,u2687,m175,ANN,Hi!
91394,L497259,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?"
91395,L497258,u2687,m175,ANN,"So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice."
91396,L497257,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Basically, yes."
91397,L497256,u2687,m175,ANN,"Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?"
91398,L497255,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Well, I wasn't always impotent."
91399,L497254,u2687,m175,ANN,"Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?"
91400,L497253,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory."
91401,L497252,u2687,m175,ANN,Of course not.
91402,L497251,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,You had sex with you therapist?
91403,L497250,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, my therapist knows me intimately."
91404,L497249,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately."
91405,L497248,u2687,m175,ANN,So you don't believe in therapy?
91406,L497247,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible..."
91407,L497246,u2687,m175,ANN,Aren't you?
91408,L497245,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,You're in therapy?
91409,L497244,u2687,m175,ANN,My therapist said that --
91410,L497243,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse."
91411,L497242,u2687,m175,ANN,What?
91412,L497241,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?"
91413,L497240,u2687,m175,ANN,Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
91414,L497239,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen."
91415,L497238,u2687,m175,ANN,Well... are you self-conscious about it?
91416,L497237,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes."
91417,L497236,u2687,m175,ANN,Does it bother you?
91418,L497235,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent."
91419,L497234,u2687,m175,ANN,You are?
91420,L497233,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Impotent.
91421,L497232,u2687,m175,ANN,You're what?
91422,L497230,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Agreed.
91423,L497229,u2687,m175,ANN,"As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you."
91424,L497228,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Do you want me to?
91425,L497227,u2687,m175,ANN,So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
91426,L497226,u2687,m175,ANN,"I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking."
91427,L497225,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Why is that?
91428,L497224,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now."
91429,L497223,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Do you want them?
91430,L497222,u2687,m175,ANN,Kids? What about them?
91431,L497221,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,So what about kids?
91432,L497220,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
91433,L497219,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love."
91434,L497218,u2687,m175,ANN,Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
91435,L497217,u2687,m175,ANN,"Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused."
91436,L497216,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same."
91437,L497215,u2687,m175,ANN,"Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway."
91438,L497214,u2687,m175,ANN,"Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John."
91439,L497213,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with."
91440,L497212,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention."
91441,L497211,u2687,m175,ANN,I feel like they do.
91442,L497210,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?"
91443,L497208,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,How do you mean?
91444,L497207,u2687,m175,ANN,"Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes."
91445,L497191,u2687,m175,ANN,"Okay, I will!!"
91446,L497190,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91447,L497189,u2687,m175,ANN,Would you mind?
91448,L497187,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Lawyers.
91449,L497186,u2687,m175,ANN,What's the first?
91450,L497185,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being."
91451,L497173,u2687,m175,ANN,Who's Elizabeth?
91452,L497172,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I don't know.
91453,L497162,u2687,m175,ANN,Younger.
91454,L497161,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Sister older or younger?
91455,L497160,u2687,m175,ANN,"Mother, father, sister."
91456,L497157,u2687,m175,ANN,Thank you.
91457,L497156,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,This food is excellent.
91458,L497149,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally."
91459,L497148,u2687,m175,ANN,That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
91460,L497147,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike."
91461,L497146,u2687,m175,ANN,Why'd you drop out?
91462,L497145,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
91463,L497144,u2687,m175,ANN,Why? Didn't you know him well?
91464,L497143,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
91465,L497142,u2687,m175,ANN,Nine years?
91466,L497141,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Nine years.
91467,L497140,u2687,m175,ANN,How long has it been since you've seen John?
91468,L497139,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
91469,L497138,u2687,m175,ANN,"You mean like ""time flies""?"
91470,L497137,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned."
91471,L497136,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, uh-huh."
91472,L497135,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes."
91473,L497134,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed."
91474,L497133,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile."
91475,L497132,u2687,m175,ANN,...free-lance. You know.
91476,L497131,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well... well, the clich about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some..."
91477,L497130,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know."
91478,L497129,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, I like it. I like it very much."
91479,L497128,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?"
91480,L497127,u2687,m175,ANN,You play an instrument?
91481,L497126,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible."
91482,L497125,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, not really."
91483,L497124,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?"
91484,L497123,u2687,m175,ANN,Well...
91485,L497122,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings."
91486,L497121,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, I think you look... fine."
91487,L497120,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
91488,L497119,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, uh-huh."
91489,L497118,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now."
91490,L497117,u2687,m175,ANN,Graham is an unusual name.
91491,L497116,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Curious.
91492,L497115,u2687,m175,ANN,No. Why?
91493,L497114,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91494,L497113,u2687,m175,ANN,Television?
91495,L497112,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Have you ever been on television?
91496,L497111,u2687,m175,ANN,Oh.
91497,L497110,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here."
91498,L497109,u2687,m175,ANN,Do you have other things?
91499,L497108,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Oh, no problem. It can wait."
91500,L497107,u2687,m175,ANN,We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
91501,L497106,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh. Well, please sit down."
91502,L497105,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,False alarm.
91503,L497104,u2687,m175,ANN,That was quick.
91504,L497098,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Graham Dalton.
91505,L497097,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes?
91506,L497096,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Ann?
91507,L497827,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91508,L497826,u2692,m175,JOHN,God damn you!!
91509,L497822,u2692,m175,JOHN,You bitch. I knew it.
91510,L497821,u2687,m175,ANN,"I have thought about it, yes."
91511,L497810,u2687,m175,ANN,Not very often.
91512,L497809,u2692,m175,JOHN,You son of a bitch!!
91513,L497803,u2687,m175,ANN,He does.
91514,L497802,u2692,m175,JOHN,Bastard...
91515,L497800,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91516,L497799,u2692,m175,JOHN,Goddam right.
91517,L497774,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes!
91518,L497773,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?"
91519,L497771,u2687,m175,ANN,I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
91520,L497770,u2692,m175,JOHN,"You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't."
91521,L497769,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off."
91522,L497768,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him."
91523,L497767,u2687,m175,ANN,I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
91524,L497766,u2692,m175,JOHN,Where did you go when you left here?
91525,L497762,u2687,m175,ANN,We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
91526,L497761,u2692,m175,JOHN,Why?
91527,L497760,u2687,m175,ANN,I want out of this marriage.
91528,L497759,u2692,m175,JOHN,What?
91529,L497758,u2687,m175,ANN,I want out of this marriage.
91530,L497757,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?"
91531,L497668,u2687,m175,ANN,I know.
91532,L497667,u2692,m175,JOHN,Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
91533,L497666,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
91534,L497665,u2692,m175,JOHN,Isn't therapy helping at all?
91535,L497664,u2687,m175,ANN,"I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced."
91536,L497663,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit."
91537,L497662,u2687,m175,ANN,Loud.
91538,L497661,u2692,m175,JOHN,"I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so..."
91539,L497660,u2687,m175,ANN,"I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why."
91540,L497659,u2692,m175,JOHN,"I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that."
91541,L497658,u2687,m175,ANN,You've made your point.
91542,L497657,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: ""Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."""
91543,L497656,u2687,m175,ANN,Always the lawyer.
91544,L497655,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition."
91545,L497654,u2687,m175,ANN,Why don't I believe you?
91546,L497653,u2692,m175,JOHN,I'm not either!!
91547,L497652,u2687,m175,ANN,But I'm not.
91548,L497651,u2692,m175,JOHN,"I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair."
91549,L497650,u2687,m175,ANN,Is that supposed to comfort me?
91550,L497649,u2692,m175,JOHN,"For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one."
91551,L497648,u2687,m175,ANN,"My sister, for one. Is that who it is?"
91552,L497647,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on."
91553,L497646,u2687,m175,ANN,I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
91554,L497645,u2692,m175,JOHN,"There's nothing to know, Ann."
91555,L497644,u2687,m175,ANN,"If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying."
91556,L497643,u2692,m175,JOHN,"No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation."
91557,L497642,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, are you?"
91558,L497641,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?"
91559,L497640,u2687,m175,ANN,Are you having an affair?
91560,L497639,u2692,m175,JOHN,Something wrong?
91561,L497638,u2692,m175,JOHN,I ate by myself.
91562,L497637,u2687,m175,ANN,Who'd you have lunch with?
91563,L497636,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know."
91564,L497635,u2687,m175,ANN,"That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message."
91565,L497634,u2692,m175,JOHN,Yes. I just got busy.
91566,L497633,u2687,m175,ANN,Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
91567,L497632,u2692,m175,JOHN,Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
91568,L497631,u2687,m175,ANN,I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
91569,L497630,u2692,m175,JOHN,Mmmmm...
91570,L497629,u2687,m175,ANN,John?
91571,L497176,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere."
91572,L497175,u2687,m175,ANN,"Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff."
91573,L497171,u2692,m175,JOHN,Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
91574,L497170,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree."
91575,L497152,u2687,m175,ANN,You did that?
91576,L497151,u2692,m175,JOHN,That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
91577,L497520,u2687,m175,ANN,"I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex."
91578,L497519,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs."
91579,L497518,u2687,m175,ANN,"Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?"
91580,L497517,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Why?
91581,L497516,u2687,m175,ANN,I hate my sister.
91582,L497340,u2687,m175,ANN,"But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?"
91583,L497339,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too."
91584,L497338,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91585,L497337,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
91586,L497336,u2687,m175,ANN,Not really.
91587,L497335,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Do you want to leave therapy?
91588,L497334,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91589,L497333,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,That you are under no obligation to me?
91590,L497332,u2687,m175,ANN,Yes.
91591,L497331,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
91592,L497330,u2687,m175,ANN,I guess.
91593,L497329,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?"
91594,L497328,u2687,m175,ANN,What do you mean? I don't understand.
91595,L497327,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?"
91596,L497326,u2687,m175,ANN,"That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff."
91597,L497325,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
91598,L497324,u2687,m175,ANN,"I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me."
91599,L497323,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,What brought this on?
91600,L497274,u2687,m175,ANN,"I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room."
91601,L497273,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
91602,L497272,u2687,m175,ANN,"What do you mean, like physically?"
91603,L497271,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Did you find him attractive?
91604,L497270,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, he left last week."
91605,L497269,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Is he still at your house?
91606,L497268,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?"
91607,L497267,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
91608,L497266,u2687,m175,ANN,What visitor?
91609,L497265,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Did you confront John about the visitor?
91610,L497264,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants."
91611,L497263,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"No, I haven't."
91612,L497262,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?"
91613,L497261,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Radon leakage?
91614,L497260,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --"
91615,L497067,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently."
91616,L497066,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,So it was recently that you tried this.
91617,L497065,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?"
91618,L497064,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,I take it you've never masturbated?
91619,L497063,u2687,m175,ANN,"God, no."
91620,L497062,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Did you masturbate?
91621,L497061,u2687,m175,ANN,What do you mean?
91622,L497060,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Did you do anything?
91623,L497059,u2687,m175,ANN,"But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself."
91624,L497058,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
91625,L497057,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden."
91626,L497056,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?"
91627,L497055,u2687,m175,ANN,"About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me."
91628,L497054,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,When did you begin having this feeling?
91629,L497053,u2687,m175,ANN,"Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me."
91630,L497052,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?"
91631,L497051,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yeah, I know."
91632,L497050,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework."
91633,L497049,u2687,m175,ANN,"I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage."
91634,L497048,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,What upsets you about that?
91635,L497047,u2687,m175,ANN,"No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked."
91636,L497046,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
91637,L497039,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke."
91638,L497038,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over."
91639,L497037,u2687,m175,ANN,"Yeah, so?"
91640,L497036,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem."
91641,L497035,u2687,m175,ANN,What do you mean?
91642,L497034,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"Ann, do you see a pattern here?"
91643,L497033,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?"
91644,L497032,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
91645,L497031,u2687,m175,ANN,Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
91646,L497030,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"No, I didn't."
91647,L497029,u2687,m175,ANN,"Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?"
91648,L497028,u2690,m175,DOCTOR,"Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?"
91649,L497992,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Bye.
91650,L497991,u2687,m175,ANN,Bye.
91651,L497990,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Okay.
91652,L497989,u2687,m175,ANN,I get real busy between two and four.
91653,L497988,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,No.
91654,L497987,u2687,m175,ANN,Do you have my work number?
91655,L497985,u2687,m175,ANN,Well. I can't stay.
91656,L497984,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Thank you.
91657,L497597,u2687,m175,ANN,Thirty-two dollars.
91658,L497596,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,So what's my share of the dress?
91659,L497582,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Hold on.
91660,L497581,u2687,m175,ANN,I was just trying to --
91661,L497577,u2687,m175,ANN,It does not.
91662,L497576,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,It looks like a tablecloth.
91663,L497575,u2687,m175,ANN,It's a sun dress.
91664,L497574,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What is it?
91665,L497573,u2687,m175,ANN,Here it is.
91666,L497564,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Then why do you keep asking about it?
91667,L497563,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't want to discuss it.
91668,L497562,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?"
91669,L497561,u2687,m175,ANN,You are in serious trouble.
91670,L497560,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,No. I don't think they all did what I did.
91671,L497559,u2687,m175,ANN,So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
91672,L497558,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
91673,L497557,u2687,m175,ANN,"That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted."
91674,L497556,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I feel like I do.
91675,L497555,u2687,m175,ANN,"You know what I mean, you don't even know him!"
91676,L497554,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"You couldn't do it, period."
91677,L497553,u2687,m175,ANN,"I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even."
91678,L497552,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Why?
91679,L497551,u2687,m175,ANN,I can't believe you did that!!
91680,L497550,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
91681,L497549,u2687,m175,ANN,You are in trouble.
91682,L497548,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"In front of him, Ann, yes."
91683,L497545,u2687,m175,ANN,You touched him?
91684,L497544,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"No, but I did."
91685,L497543,u2687,m175,ANN,Did he touch you?
91686,L497542,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, it's too late now, isn't it?"
91687,L497541,u2687,m175,ANN,You don't know that for sure.
91688,L497540,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,He wouldn't do that.
91689,L497539,u2687,m175,ANN,"Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it."
91690,L497538,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I wanted him to see me.
91691,L497537,u2687,m175,ANN,But why did you want to?
91692,L497536,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Because I wanted to.
91693,L497535,u2687,m175,ANN,Why did you do that?
91694,L497534,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What!?
91695,L497533,u2687,m175,ANN,Cynthia!
91696,L497532,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Yes, I did."
91697,L497529,u2687,m175,ANN,Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
91698,L497528,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Apparently.
91699,L497527,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?"
91700,L497526,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly."
91701,L497525,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, like what did he ask, exactly?"
91702,L497524,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Questions about sex.
91703,L497523,u2687,m175,ANN,What kinds of questions?
91704,L497522,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,He just asked me questions.
91705,L497406,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't know.
91706,L497405,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Then why'd you call me?
91707,L497404,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't want to talk about it.
91708,L497403,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, what, then?"
91709,L497402,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, he's not dangerous. Not physically."
91710,L497401,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, what? Is he dangerous?"
91711,L497400,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, it's nothing like that."
91712,L497399,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Then what's the story, what's this ""strange"" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?"
91713,L497398,u2687,m175,ANN,No!
91714,L497397,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
91715,L497396,u2687,m175,ANN,"Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him."
91716,L497395,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, why?"
91717,L497394,u2687,m175,ANN,Because I never got around to it.
91718,L497393,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Why not?
91719,L497392,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, I didn't."
91720,L497391,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
91721,L497390,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
91722,L497322,u2687,m175,ANN,I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
91723,L497321,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work."
91724,L497320,u2687,m175,ANN,Fine.
91725,L497319,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?"
91726,L497318,u2687,m175,ANN,I just thought it might --
91727,L497317,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Will you stop? Jesus.
91728,L497316,u2687,m175,ANN,"Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --"
91729,L497315,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What's wrong with that?
91730,L497314,u2687,m175,ANN,A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
91731,L497313,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I don't know, I'll get her a card or something."
91732,L497312,u2687,m175,ANN,Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
91733,L497311,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
91734,L497310,u2687,m175,ANN,Lose something?
91735,L497309,u2687,m175,ANN,And... do whatever it is you do.
91736,L497308,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,And what?
91737,L497307,u2687,m175,ANN,I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
91738,L497306,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved."
91739,L497305,u2687,m175,ANN,Let me talk to him first.
91740,L497304,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by."
91741,L497303,u2687,m175,ANN,"He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone."
91742,L497302,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What are you talking about?
91743,L497301,u2687,m175,ANN,But he won't.
91744,L497300,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, I'll call him when he does."
91745,L497299,u2687,m175,ANN,He doesn't have a phone.
91746,L497298,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself."
91747,L497297,u2687,m175,ANN,I have a pretty good idea.
91748,L497296,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"""My type""? What is this bullshit? How would you know what ""my type"" is?"
91749,L497295,u2687,m175,ANN,"Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type."
91750,L497294,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
91751,L497293,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, I wonder why."
91752,L497292,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Ann, you always underestimate me."
91753,L497291,u2687,m175,ANN,"Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway."
91754,L497290,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I say it because it's descriptive.
91755,L497289,u2687,m175,ANN,You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
91756,L497288,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What?
91757,L497287,u2687,m175,ANN,Do you have to say that?
91758,L497286,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?"
91759,L497285,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like."
91760,L497284,u2687,m175,ANN,"Why, so you can go after him?"
91761,L497283,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I just want to know what he looks like, is all."
91762,L497282,u2687,m175,ANN,Why?
91763,L497281,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
91764,L497280,u2687,m175,ANN,"Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual."
91765,L497279,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Is he? Strange, I mean?"
91766,L497278,u2687,m175,ANN,"No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange."
91767,L497277,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?"
91768,L497276,u2687,m175,ANN,"I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around."
91769,L497579,u2687,m175,ANN,"So will you, someday."
91770,L497578,u2689,m175,CYTNHIA,"Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins."
91771,L497572,u2687,m175,ANN,It was busy.
91772,L497571,u2689,m175,CYTNHIA,There's a phone here.
91773,L497570,u2687,m175,ANN,I wish you'd get an answering machine.
91774,L497547,u2687,m175,ANN,Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
91775,L497546,u2689,m175,CYTNHIA,"No, I touched me."
91776,L497531,u2687,m175,ANN,Did you take your clothes off?
91777,L497530,u2689,m175,CYTNHIA,"Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't."
91778,L497624,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91779,L497623,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Goddamit, give me my tape, then."
91780,L497622,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm sorry. I can't do it.
91781,L497621,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
91782,L497620,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Cynthia, I don't know."
91783,L497619,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?"
91784,L497618,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I would.
91785,L497617,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
91786,L497616,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91787,L497615,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,So make an exception.
91788,L497614,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice."
91789,L497613,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything."
91790,L497612,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
91791,L497611,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
91792,L497610,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No. You'll have to get somebody else.
91793,L497609,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I can't talk you into it?
91794,L497608,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
91795,L497607,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,No? Not even one more?
91796,L497606,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91797,L497605,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I'd like to make another tape.
91798,L497604,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Okay.
91799,L497603,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?"
91800,L497602,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Hi.
91801,L497601,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Hello.
91802,L497512,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,He doesn't have to tell me.
91803,L497511,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Is that what he tells you?
91804,L497510,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
91805,L497509,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Different.
91806,L497508,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Prettier than Ann?
91807,L497507,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91808,L497506,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Do you think I'm pretty?
91809,L497505,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91810,L497504,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Do you like the way I look?
91811,L497503,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
91812,L497502,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Would you like me to take my pants off?
91813,L497494,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking."
91814,L497493,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Then what happened?
91815,L497492,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,He said that my hand felt good.
91816,L497491,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,What did he say?
91817,L497490,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me."
91818,L497489,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?"
91819,L497488,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?"
91820,L497487,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Were you disappointed?
91821,L497486,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube."
91822,L497485,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
91823,L497484,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Very much live.
91824,L497483,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?"
91825,L497482,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,When I was fourteen.
91826,L497481,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
91827,L497480,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually."
91828,L497479,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
91829,L497478,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, ""Ladies first!"" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished."
91830,L497477,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Your first sexual experience.
91831,L497476,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
91832,L497475,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Describe for me your first sexual experience.
91833,L497474,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
91834,L497473,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I am now recording. Tell me your name.
91835,L497472,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Just a moment.
91836,L497471,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
91837,L497470,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Whichever you prefer.
91838,L497469,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Do I sit or stand?
91839,L497468,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
91840,L497467,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
91841,L497466,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
91842,L497465,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,How long will it take?
91843,L497464,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91844,L497463,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"And you ask questions, right?"
91845,L497462,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I turn on the camera. You start talking.
91846,L497461,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,How do we start?
91847,L497460,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
91848,L497459,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Would anybody else see the tape?
91849,L497458,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Yes.
91850,L497457,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
91851,L497456,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,That's all.
91852,L497455,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,And that's all?
91853,L497454,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I just want to ask you questions.
91854,L497453,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,You just want to ask me questions?
91855,L497452,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Nothing.
91856,L497451,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
91857,L497450,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences."
91858,L497449,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,About what?
91859,L497448,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Talking.
91860,L497447,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Doing what?
91861,L497446,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Why don't you let me tape you?
91862,L497445,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?"
91863,L497444,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Not exactly.
91864,L497443,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?"
91865,L497442,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,What do you get?
91866,L497441,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Oh, okay. I think I get it."
91867,L497439,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Spooked.
91868,L497438,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened."
91869,L497437,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Nope. I think the man is a liar.
91870,L497436,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something."
91871,L497435,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me."
91872,L497434,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I, uh, know a guy at the power company."
91873,L497433,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,How did you find me?
91874,L497432,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Nope.
91875,L497431,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,She didn't give you my address?
91876,L497430,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Nope.
91877,L497429,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,She didn't tell you why she was upset?
91878,L497428,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Nope.
91879,L497427,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
91880,L497426,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,She still is.
91881,L497425,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset."
91882,L497424,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest."
91883,L497423,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I just want to know why you're here.
91884,L497422,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,You want me to leave?
91885,L497421,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?"
91886,L497420,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
91887,L497419,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,The extrovert.
91888,L497418,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
91889,L497417,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Do I know you?
91890,L497416,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I'm Cynthia Bishop.
91891,L497415,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Who are you?
91892,L497720,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"No, John, things are getting real simple."
91893,L497719,u2692,m175,JOHN,"I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated."
91894,L497718,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"John, we have nothing to talk about."
91895,L497717,u2692,m175,JOHN,Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
91896,L497716,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I know. Will you please leave now?
91897,L497715,u2692,m175,JOHN,"God, you... you're mean."
91898,L497714,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
91899,L497713,u2692,m175,JOHN,I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
91900,L497712,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all."
91901,L497711,u2692,m175,JOHN,Graham.
91902,L497710,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Who?
91903,L497709,u2692,m175,JOHN,Did he put you up to this?
91904,L497708,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime."
91905,L497707,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,How about straightening up the living room?
91906,L497706,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something..."
91907,L497705,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called."
91908,L497704,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Look, are we going to do it or not?"
91909,L497703,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be ""faithful"" to my sister."
91910,L497702,u2692,m175,JOHN,"By definition you're lying to Ann, too."
91911,L497701,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out."
91912,L497700,u2692,m175,JOHN,It hurts that you would say that to me.
91913,L497699,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
91914,L497698,u2692,m175,JOHN,What do you mean?
91915,L497697,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you."
91916,L497696,u2692,m175,JOHN,You trust him.
91917,L497695,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,It won't. I trust him.
91918,L497694,u2692,m175,JOHN,You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
91919,L497693,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,No.
91920,L497692,u2692,m175,JOHN,"It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?"
91921,L497691,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Hung up.
91922,L497690,u2692,m175,JOHN,I just... Ann is very...
91923,L497689,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"She's a grown-up, she can handle it."
91924,L497688,u2692,m175,JOHN,It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
91925,L497687,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Why not?
91926,L497686,u2692,m175,JOHN,I wish you hadn't done that.
91927,L497685,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
91928,L497684,u2692,m175,JOHN,You told Ann about this?
91929,L497683,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it."
91930,L497682,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean..."
91931,L497681,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them."
91932,L497680,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?"
91933,L497679,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Right.
91934,L497678,u2692,m175,JOHN,Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
91935,L497677,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"""The wrong hands""? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off."
91936,L497676,u2692,m175,JOHN,What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
91937,L497675,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I like the way he dresses.
91938,L497674,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat."
91939,L497673,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?"
91940,L497672,u2692,m175,JOHN,That you... you don't even know the guy.
91941,L497671,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,What's so stupid about it?
91942,L497670,u2692,m175,JOHN,"It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it."
91943,L497595,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Look, I'll call you, okay?"
91944,L497594,u2692,m175,JOHN,Do you want me to stop calling?
91945,L497593,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I don't think my sister would agree.
91946,L497592,u2692,m175,JOHN,Nothing wrong with trying.
91947,L497591,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
91948,L497588,u2692,m175,JOHN,She's there? What's she doing there?
91949,L497587,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?"
91950,L497586,u2692,m175,JOHN,Cynthia. John.
91951,L497585,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Hello.
91952,L497500,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
91953,L497499,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling."
91954,L497498,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Right now.
91955,L497497,u2692,m175,JOHN,When?
91956,L497496,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I want to see you.
91957,L497495,u2692,m175,JOHN,John Millaney.
91958,L497413,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
91959,L497412,u2692,m175,JOHN,You know what I mean.
91960,L497411,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,How about inviting me over to dinner?
91961,L497410,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Oh.  Well, when, then?"
91962,L497409,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Not today. I've got other plans.
91963,L497408,u2692,m175,JOHN,Cynthia. John.
91964,L497407,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Hello.
91965,L497205,u2692,m175,JOHN,In here!!
91966,L497204,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,John?
91967,L497194,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,You are scum. I'll be there.
91968,L497193,u2692,m175,JOHN,Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
91969,L497192,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Hello.
91970,L497094,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
91971,L497093,u2692,m175,JOHN,You're intrigued?
91972,L497092,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I'm intrigued.
91973,L497091,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way."
91974,L497090,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
91975,L497089,u2692,m175,JOHN,Maybe.
91976,L497088,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Afraid of getting caught?
91977,L497087,u2692,m175,JOHN,"No, I mean doing it at my house."
91978,L497086,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then."
91979,L497085,u2692,m175,JOHN,Could be risky.
91980,L497084,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney."
91981,L497082,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,I did.
91982,L497081,u2692,m175,JOHN,Who said I was jealous?
91983,L497080,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous."
91984,L497079,u2692,m175,JOHN,I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
91985,L497078,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,Why?
91986,L497077,u2692,m175,JOHN,I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
91987,L497076,u2692,m175,JOHN,Right.
91988,L497075,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?"
91989,L497074,u2692,m175,JOHN,"I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days."
91990,L497072,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?"
91991,L497071,u2692,m175,JOHN,I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
91992,L497070,u2688,m175,CYNTHIA,"I only get one today? Gee, how exciting."
91993,L497069,u2692,m175,JOHN,I've got to get back to the office.
91994,L497202,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,How about for five hundred?
91995,L497201,u2693,m175,MR. MILLER,Not for three-fifty.
91996,L497200,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Will you lease month-to-month?
91997,L497199,u2693,m175,MR. MILLER,Plus first and last month deposit.
91998,L497198,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.  You said three-fifty?
91999,L497197,u2693,m175,MR. MILLER,Student?
92000,L497196,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,It'll just be me.
92001,L497195,u2693,m175,MR. MILLER,Plenty of room for two people.
92002,L497816,u2692,m175,JOHN,Shut up!!!
92003,L497815,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
92004,L497814,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Answer him, goddammit!!"
92005,L497813,u2692,m175,JOHN,Goddamit...
92006,L497812,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
92007,L497795,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm not going to give you my keys.
92008,L497794,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!"
92009,L497793,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,My keys?
92010,L497792,u2692,m175,JOHN,Give me your keys.
92011,L497790,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
92012,L497789,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes."
92013,L497788,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
92014,L497787,u2692,m175,JOHN,"I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes."
92015,L497786,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,No.
92016,L497785,u2692,m175,JOHN,"I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes."
92017,L497784,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"God, you need help."
92018,L497783,u2692,m175,JOHN,What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
92019,L497782,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?"
92020,L497781,u2692,m175,JOHN,"So is my wife, asshole!!"
92021,L497780,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property."
92022,L497779,u2692,m175,JOHN,You know which tapes! Where are they?
92023,L497778,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,What tapes?
92024,L497777,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Where are the tapes, Graham?"
92025,L497776,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Hi, John."
92026,L497183,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Or go someplace in a hurry.
92027,L497182,u2692,m175,JOHN,Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
92028,L497181,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"I like having the car, the car is important."
92029,L497180,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key."
92030,L497178,u2692,m175,JOHN,What do you mean?
92031,L497177,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
92032,L497168,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,She held up very well.
92033,L497167,u2692,m175,JOHN,Really. How'd it go?
92034,L497166,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon."
92035,L497165,u2692,m175,JOHN,You were prying before?
92036,L497164,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
92037,L497159,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,You have family here also?
92038,L497158,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out."
92039,L497155,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,"A bonfire, probably."
92040,L497154,u2692,m175,JOHN,What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
92041,L497153,u2691,m175,GRAHAM,Everybody has a past.
92042,L497977,u2695,m175,VOICE ON PHONE,"Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me."
92043,L497976,u2692,m175,JOHN,Yes?
92044,L497975,u2695,m175,VOICE ON PHONE,Mr. Millaney?
92045,L497968,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?"
92046,L497967,u2695,m175,VOICE ON PHONE,One moment.
92047,L497966,u2692,m175,JOHN,John Millaney.
92048,L497965,u2695,m175,VOICE ON PHONE,May I ask who's calling?
92049,L497964,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Brian Kirkland, please."
92050,L497963,u2695,m175,VOICE ON PHONE,IBM.
92051,L497974,u2692,m175,JOHN,"All right, jesus."
92052,L497973,u2694,m175,SECRETARY,He said immediately.
92053,L497972,u2692,m175,JOHN,"Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client."
92054,L497971,u2694,m175,SECRETARY,Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
92055,L497970,u2692,m175,JOHN,Yeah.
92056,L497969,u2694,m175,SECRETARY,Mr. Millaney?
92057,L503325,u2696,m176,BETTS,"Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me."
92058,L503324,u2701,m176,JANINE,"Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny."
92059,L503211,u2696,m176,BETTS,Was he nice to you?
92060,L503210,u2701,m176,JANINE,No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
92061,L503209,u2696,m176,BETTS,Hi. Want a drink?
92062,L503208,u2701,m176,JANINE,Hi.
92063,L503158,u2696,m176,BETTS,So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
92064,L503157,u2701,m176,JANINE,He'll be really mad.
92065,L503156,u2696,m176,BETTS,"Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out."
92066,L503155,u2701,m176,JANINE,He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
92067,L503154,u2696,m176,BETTS,"...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?"
92068,L503221,u2697,m176,BOY,Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
92069,L503220,u2700,m176,GIRL,Jesus!
92070,L503218,u2700,m176,GIRL,With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
92071,L503217,u2697,m176,BOY,"Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?"
92072,L503216,u2700,m176,GIRL,"OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself."
92073,L503215,u2697,m176,BOY,"I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead."
92074,L503214,u2700,m176,GIRL,"C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it."
92075,L503115,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,He sounded fine.
92076,L503114,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
92077,L503113,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come."
92078,L503112,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,I see. Then what brought you up here?
92079,L503111,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today."
92080,L503110,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
92081,L503109,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic."
92082,L503108,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,You knew these people?
92083,L503107,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"No, nothing."
92084,L503106,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
92085,L503105,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Yes.
92086,L503104,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,You're the one who found the bodies?
92087,L503103,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Sure.
92088,L503102,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
92089,L503101,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,"Well, let's go talk to your doctor."
92090,L503100,u2706,m176,SUPER,"Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains."
92091,L503099,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,Medical clinic?
92092,L503098,u2706,m176,SUPER,"Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here."
92093,L503097,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,Is that the man who called you up here?
92094,L503096,u2706,m176,SUPER,"Far as I know, yeah, that was her."
92095,L503095,u2698,m176,DETECTIVE,And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
92096,L503302,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Down to the incinerator.
92097,L503301,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,But where are you going?
92098,L503287,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,"Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you."
92099,L503286,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
92100,L503285,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
92101,L503284,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Where is he now? Do you know?
92102,L503283,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,"A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me..."
92103,L503282,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?"
92104,L503272,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
92105,L503271,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,OK. But late.
92106,L503270,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,Well? Supper at my place?
92107,L503269,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,No. I don't think so.
92108,L503268,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,Anything wrong?
92109,L503267,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
92110,L503266,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
92111,L503265,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,"Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?"
92112,L503239,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,No. Dotty's the last.
92113,L503238,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?"
92114,L503237,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,Another kiss?
92115,L503236,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"Uh, OK. Sure."
92116,L503235,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,"Kiss, kiss?"
92117,L503234,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,Do I get a kiss?
92118,L503233,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks."
92119,L503232,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,"OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you."
92120,L503181,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
92121,L503180,u2699,m176,FORSYTHE,"Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor."
92122,L503315,u2701,m176,JANINE,"I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?"
92123,L503314,u2707,m176,TUDOR,"Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me..."
92124,L503310,u2707,m176,TUDOR,"Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine..."
92125,L503309,u2701,m176,JANINE,"Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this."
92126,L503308,u2707,m176,TUDOR,"You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start."
92127,L503307,u2701,m176,JANINE,"Nick, you're so strange..."
92128,L503306,u2707,m176,TUDOR,"Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?"
92129,L503152,u2707,m176,TUDOR,Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
92130,L503151,u2701,m176,JANINE,You say something?
92131,L503089,u2707,m176,TUDOR,I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
92132,L503088,u2701,m176,JANINE,I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
92133,L503087,u2707,m176,TUDOR,What do you want to call me at the office for?
92134,L503086,u2701,m176,JANINE,Can I call you at the office?
92135,L503333,u2702,m176,MR. SPERGAZZI,"Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you."
92136,L503332,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please."
92137,L503331,u2702,m176,MR. SPERGAZZI,Yes? Who is there?
92138,L503300,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
92139,L503299,u2702,m176,MR. SPERGAZZI,We live in 703.
92140,L503298,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
92141,L503296,u2702,m176,MR. SPERGAZZI,"I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage."
92142,L503295,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
92143,L503293,u2702,m176,MR. SPERGAZZI,"Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm."
92144,L503292,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,What happened?
92145,L503207,u2703,m176,PARKINS,"Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that."
92146,L503206,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"Well, let's wait for the X-rays."
92147,L503205,u2703,m176,PARKINS,Gonna cut me open?
92148,L503204,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology."
92149,L503202,u2703,m176,PARKINS,That's the one.
92150,L503201,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
92151,L503200,u2703,m176,PARKINS,"Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother."
92152,L503199,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
92153,L503198,u2703,m176,PARKINS,Didn't seem worried about them.
92154,L503197,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
92155,L503196,u2703,m176,PARKINS,"She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself."
92156,L503195,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?"
92157,L503194,u2703,m176,PARKINS,"Good shape for an old man, eh?"
92158,L503193,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Just breathe normally.
92159,L503192,u2703,m176,PARKINS,Want me to breathe deeply?
92160,L503264,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"OK, Rog. See you at ten."
92161,L503263,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly."
92162,L503262,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them."
92163,L503261,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Yeah? What do I do then?
92164,L503260,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things..."
92165,L503259,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
92166,L503258,u2704,m176,ROLLO,I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
92167,L503257,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list."
92168,L503256,u2704,m176,ROLLO,Huh?
92169,L503255,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,He didn't make it.
92170,L503252,u2704,m176,ROLLO,Lemme clarify for you.
92171,L503251,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,I don't get it.
92172,L503250,u2704,m176,ROLLO,It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
92173,L503249,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"OK, I bite. What does it look like?"
92174,L503248,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like."
92175,L503247,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,No? How come?
92176,L503246,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them."
92177,L503244,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
92178,L503243,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?"
92179,L503242,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Yes?
92180,L503241,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"That you, Rog?"
92181,L503240,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Yes?
92182,L503150,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,OK. I'll think about it.
92183,L503149,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?"
92184,L503145,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask."
92185,L503144,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Who was she?
92186,L503143,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects."
92187,L503142,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
92188,L503141,u2704,m176,ROLLO,You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
92189,L503140,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP."
92190,L503139,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation."
92191,L503133,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?"
92192,L503132,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,I don't get it.
92193,L503131,u2704,m176,ROLLO,Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
92194,L503130,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,It's crazy.
92195,L503129,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy."
92196,L503128,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it."
92197,L503127,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,Did I say anything?
92198,L503126,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?"
92199,L503123,u2704,m176,ROLLO,"That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!"
92200,L503122,u2705,m176,ST. LUC,"But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?"
92201,L503121,u2704,m176,ROLLO,So who changes?

92247,L503673,u2710,m177,BERT,"After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?"

92249,L503643,u2710,m177,BERT,Home?
92250,L503642,u2716,m177,JANET,Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
92251,L503641,u2710,m177,BERT,Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
92252,L503634,u2710,m177,BERT,On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
92253,L503633,u2716,m177,JANET,Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
92254,L503447,u2710,m177,BERT,"It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep."
92255,L503446,u2716,m177,JANET,I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
92256,L503445,u2710,m177,BERT,"Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!"
92257,L503444,u2716,m177,JANET,I've caught it once or twice.
92258,L503443,u2710,m177,BERT,"Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?"
92259,L503442,u2710,m177,BERT,Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
92260,L503441,u2716,m177,JANET,"I know, I know, it's just..."
92261,L503439,u2716,m177,JANET,He needs help.
92262,L503438,u2710,m177,BERT,"We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad."
92263,L503437,u2716,m177,JANET,I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
92264,L503436,u2710,m177,BERT,Introduce yourselves.
92265,L503675,u2721,m177,NATION,They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
92266,L503674,u2710,m177,BERT,In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
92267,L503602,u2721,m177,NATION,So it seems.
92268,L503601,u2710,m177,BERT,"Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley."

92273,L503540,u2721,m177,NATION,Dear old Bert's settled everything.
92274,L503709,u2718,m177,MAC,Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.

92278,L503591,u2710,m177,BERT,Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
92279,L503590,u2718,m177,MAC,With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
92280,L503539,u2718,m177,MAC,SOLD??!!
92281,L503538,u2710,m177,BERT,Dentonvale has been sold.
92282,L503537,u2718,m177,MAC,SPONSOR!!!
92283,L503536,u2710,m177,BERT,"No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor."
92284,L503535,u2718,m177,MAC,"Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?"
92285,L504015,u2711,m177,BETTY,SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
92286,L504014,u2723,m177,OLIVER,SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
92287,L503871,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own."
92288,L503870,u2711,m177,BETTY,Really.  What'll I pin this on?
92289,L503869,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up."
92290,L503868,u2711,m177,BETTY,He was a President.
92291,L503867,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?"
92292,L503820,u2723,m177,OLIVER,In a little masquerade?
92293,L503819,u2711,m177,BETTY,Indulge?
92294,L503818,u2723,m177,OLIVER,Care to indulge?
92295,L503815,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset."
92296,L503814,u2711,m177,BETTY,"Did you /hear/ that, Oliver."
92297,L503771,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind."
92298,L503770,u2711,m177,BETTY,Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
92299,L503652,u2711,m177,BETTY,Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
92300,L503651,u2723,m177,OLIVER,A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
92301,L503650,u2711,m177,BETTY,"It pays to know your way around, Oliver."
92302,L503649,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Clever of you to find this spot, Betty."
92303,L503640,u2711,m177,BETTY,Are you spoken for this evening?
92304,L503639,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Yes, Betty."
92305,L503638,u2711,m177,BETTY,Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
92306,L503637,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Now Betty, don't overreact."
92307,L503636,u2711,m177,BETTY,I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
92308,L503587,u2723,m177,OLIVER,...closed?
92309,L503586,u2711,m177,BETTY,Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
92310,L503575,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it..."
92311,L503574,u2711,m177,BETTY,Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
92312,L503573,u2723,m177,OLIVER,It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
92313,L503572,u2711,m177,BETTY,Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
92314,L503449,u2711,m177,BETTY,Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
92315,L503448,u2723,m177,OLIVER,McKinley?...McKinley?
92316,L503427,u2723,m177,OLIVER,Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
92317,L503426,u2711,m177,BETTY,"Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde."
92318,L503417,u2711,m177,BETTY,Everything's free there.
92319,L503416,u2723,m177,OLIVER,A free thinker.
92320,L503412,u2711,m177,BETTY,"Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man."
92321,L503411,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man."
92322,L503410,u2711,m177,BETTY,"Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?"
92323,L503409,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!"
92324,L503408,u2711,m177,BETTY,"Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview."
92325,L503388,u2723,m177,OLIVER,"Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly..."
92326,L503387,u2711,m177,BETTY,"I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?"
92327,L503386,u2723,m177,OLIVER,In a way...
92328,L503817,u2727,m177,RALPH,No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
92329,L503816,u2711,m177,BETTY,"Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?"
92330,L503584,u2727,m177,RALPH,"You too, Betty!"
92331,L503583,u2711,m177,BETTY,"Shove it, Ralph!"
92332,L503582,u2727,m177,RALPH,I'll leave you young things to it.
92333,L503579,u2727,m177,RALPH,"Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this."
92334,L503578,u2711,m177,BETTY,Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
92335,L503577,u2727,m177,RALPH,"Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?"

92387,L503626,u2721,m177,NATION,"The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you."
92388,L503625,u2716,m177,JANET,I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
92389,L503612,u2716,m177,JANET,That doesn't make sense.
92390,L503611,u2721,m177,NATION,But they only think they're happy.
92391,L503498,u2721,m177,NATION,Of course.
92392,L503497,u2716,m177,JANET,Could I do that later?
92393,L503739,u2716,m177,JANET,I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
92394,L503738,u2720,m177,MOM,You're practically naked!
92395,L503737,u2716,m177,JANET,"Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser."
92396,L503736,u2720,m177,MOM,Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
92397,L503735,u2716,m177,JANET,I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
92398,L503554,u2720,m177,MOM,Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
92399,L503553,u2716,m177,JANET,Why?
92400,L503552,u2720,m177,MOM,You shouldn't have said that.
92401,L503545,u2720,m177,MOM,Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
92402,L503544,u2716,m177,JANET,Poor Brad.
92403,L503527,u2716,m177,JANET,What show?
92404,L503526,u2720,m177,MOM,"Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started."
92405,L503525,u2716,m177,JANET,It's...
92406,L503524,u2720,m177,MOM,They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
92407,L503522,u2720,m177,MOM,I know.
92408,L503521,u2716,m177,JANET,Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
92409,L503520,u2720,m177,MOM,Oh my poor baby.
92410,L503571,u2726,m177,PARKER,"Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs."
92411,L503570,u2716,m177,JANET,Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
92412,L503569,u2726,m177,PARKER,"Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise..."
92413,L503568,u2716,m177,JANET,Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
92414,L503567,u2726,m177,PARKER,Vance!  Vance Parker.
92415,L503566,u2716,m177,JANET,"I'm sorry, Officer."
92416,L503565,u2726,m177,PARKER,Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
92417,L503853,u2730,m177,TRIO,YOUNG BLOOD
92418,L503852,u2716,m177,JANET,I NEED SOME
92419,L503851,u2730,m177,TRIO,YOUNG BLOOD
92420,L503850,u2716,m177,JANET,I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
92421,L503849,u2730,m177,TRIO,YOUNG BLOOD
92422,L503848,u2716,m177,JANET,I NEED SOME
92423,L503847,u2730,m177,TRIO,YOUNG BLOOD
92424,L503846,u2716,m177,JANET,I NEED SOME
92425,L503841,u2730,m177,TRIO,OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
92426,L503840,u2716,m177,JANET,"BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?"
92427,L503964,u2716,m177,JANET,I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
92428,L503963,u2718,m177,MAC,Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
92429,L503962,u2716,m177,JANET,BRAD!
92430,L503798,u2716,m177,JANET,I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
92431,L503797,u2718,m177,MAC,Brad!
92432,L503748,u2718,m177,MAC,Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
92433,L503747,u2716,m177,JANET,. . .For his own good.
92434,L503689,u2718,m177,MAC,"EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK"
92435,L503688,u2716,m177,JANET,But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
92436,L503687,u2718,m177,MAC,You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
92437,L503686,u2716,m177,JANET,Do you really think so?
92438,L503685,u2718,m177,MAC,"He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead."
92439,L503684,u2716,m177,JANET,If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
92440,L503683,u2718,m177,MAC,You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
92441,L503682,u2718,m177,MAC,"Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty."
92442,L503681,u2716,m177,JANET,Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
92443,L503678,u2718,m177,MAC,"I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself."
92444,L503677,u2716,m177,JANET,I want to see Brad.
92445,L503630,u2718,m177,MAC,It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
92446,L503629,u2716,m177,JANET,Me?
92447,L503628,u2718,m177,MAC,Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
92448,L503610,u2718,m177,MAC,There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
92449,L503609,u2716,m177,JANET,I'm...happy.
92450,L503501,u2716,m177,JANET,No...couldn't I do this later?
92451,L503500,u2718,m177,MAC,Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
92452,L503490,u2718,m177,MAC,Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
92453,L503489,u2716,m177,JANET,No!  He's never done that before.

92464,L504005,u2718,m177,MAC,In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
92465,L504004,u2721,m177,NATION,This could be worse than the old series.
92466,L503701,u2721,m177,NATION,SIN-I-FUL
92467,L503700,u2718,m177,MAC,CRIMINAL

92471,L503663,u2718,m177,MAC,OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...

92475,L503659,u2718,m177,MAC,WHAT A JOKE...
92476,L503658,u2721,m177,NATION,WHAT A JOKE...
92477,L503657,u2718,m177,MAC,YOU'RE NO GOOD
92478,L503656,u2721,m177,NATION,YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
92479,L503655,u2718,m177,MAC,YOU'RE NO GOOD

92481,L503645,u2718,m177,MAC,And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
92482,L503644,u2721,m177,NATION,"This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush."
92483,L503632,u2721,m177,NATION,"Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad."
92484,L503631,u2718,m177,MAC,That's an extremely negative response.
92485,L503608,u2721,m177,NATION,"Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?"
92486,L503607,u2718,m177,MAC,"It's you we're concerned about, Janet."
92487,L503593,u2718,m177,MAC,What does he know about it?
92488,L503592,u2721,m177,NATION,Our field.
92489,L503543,u2721,m177,NATION,I don't think he intends to go that far.
92490,L503542,u2718,m177,MAC,HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
92491,L503533,u2718,m177,MAC,"I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!"
92492,L503532,u2721,m177,NATION,Our speciality.
92493,L503485,u2721,m177,NATION,We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
92494,L503484,u2718,m177,MAC,"Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley."
92495,L503883,u2727,m177,RALPH,THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
92496,L503882,u2719,m177,MACY,LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
92497,L503881,u2727,m177,RALPH,THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
92498,L503809,u2727,m177,RALPH,...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
92499,L503808,u2719,m177,MACY,So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
92500,L503777,u2719,m177,MACY,Surely.
92501,L503776,u2727,m177,RALPH,"Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal."
92502,L503775,u2719,m177,MACY,Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
92503,L503942,u2721,m177,NATION,We all love Janet...Who do we love?
92504,L503941,u2720,m177,MOM,"We love you, Baby."
92505,L503940,u2721,m177,NATION,She walks in beauty...
92506,L503939,u2720,m177,MOM,"Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby."
92507,L503938,u2721,m177,NATION,Isn't she lovely?
92508,L503758,u2720,m177,MOM,We're not confused.
92509,L503757,u2721,m177,NATION,"And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion."
92510,L503753,u2721,m177,NATION,No.
92511,L503752,u2720,m177,MOM,And none of them worked?
92512,L504961,u2731,m178,CAMMI,"Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from ""One Life to Live""?"
92513,L504960,u2735,m178,JACK,Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
92514,L504959,u2731,m178,CAMMI,I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
92515,L504958,u2735,m178,JACK,"No, we're from San Diego. Why?"
92516,L504957,u2731,m178,CAMMI,"It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?"
92517,L504956,u2735,m178,JACK,Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
92518,L505013,u2731,m178,CAMMI,The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
92519,L505012,u2736,m178,MAN,The fuck was that?
92520,L505011,u2731,m178,CAMMI,I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
92521,L505010,u2736,m178,MAN,"And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?"
92522,L505009,u2731,m178,CAMMI,I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
92523,L505008,u2736,m178,MAN,"You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?"
92524,L505007,u2731,m178,CAMMI,I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
92525,L505006,u2736,m178,MAN,"You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you."
92526,L504121,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,Bye.
92527,L504120,u2735,m178,JACK,I love you.
92528,L504119,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,Bye.
92529,L504118,u2735,m178,JACK,"Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?"
92530,L504117,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,"I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you."
92531,L504116,u2735,m178,JACK,"I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked."
92532,L504115,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,Why are you being so defensive?
92533,L504114,u2735,m178,JACK,"Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?"
92534,L504113,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,"I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important."
92535,L504112,u2735,m178,JACK,"I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes."
92536,L504111,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
92537,L504110,u2735,m178,JACK,Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
92538,L504109,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
92539,L504108,u2735,m178,JACK,"Well, then put him at the singles table."
92540,L504107,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,"Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --"
92541,L504104,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,"Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?"
92542,L504103,u2735,m178,JACK,So what's up?
92543,L504102,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,Good. That's good.
92544,L504101,u2735,m178,JACK,Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
92545,L504100,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,You guys having fun?
92546,L504099,u2735,m178,JACK,It's Christine.  Hey you.
92547,L504052,u2732,m178,CHRISTINE,It'll just take a second.
92548,L504051,u2735,m178,JACK,Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
92549,L504891,u2733,m178,EVELYN,"You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged."
92550,L504890,u2738,m178,MILES,So I guess that's it.
92551,L504889,u2733,m178,EVELYN,"I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back."
92552,L504888,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, I'm here."
92553,L504887,u2733,m178,EVELYN,Are you there? Miles?
92554,L504886,u2733,m178,EVELYN,"I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing."
92555,L504885,u2738,m178,MILES,Huh.
92556,L504884,u2733,m178,EVELYN,"And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call."
92557,L504883,u2738,m178,MILES,And?
92558,L504882,u2733,m178,EVELYN,Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
92559,L504881,u2738,m178,MILES,"Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?"
92560,L504880,u2733,m178,EVELYN,How's the trip?
92561,L504879,u2738,m178,MILES,"Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client."
92562,L504878,u2733,m178,EVELYN,Miles.
92563,L504742,u2738,m178,MILES,I'm good.
92564,L504741,u2734,m178,GARY,"You okay, Miles?"
92565,L504739,u2734,m178,GARY,"Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?"
92566,L504738,u2738,m178,MILES,"Say, is Maya working?"
92567,L504737,u2734,m178,GARY,You got it.
92568,L504736,u2738,m178,MILES,Bottle.
92569,L504735,u2734,m178,GARY,Glass or bottle?
92570,L504734,u2738,m178,MILES,Highliner.
92571,L504733,u2734,m178,GARY,"Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?"
92572,L504732,u2738,m178,MILES,You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
92573,L504731,u2734,m178,GARY,"How's it hanging, Miles?"
92574,L504282,u2738,m178,MILES,Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
92575,L504281,u2734,m178,GARY,What do you think?
92576,L504280,u2738,m178,MILES,Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
92577,L504279,u2734,m178,GARY,Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
92578,L504278,u2738,m178,MILES,What are you pouring tonight?
92579,L504277,u2734,m178,GARY,My condolences.
92580,L504276,u2738,m178,MILES,"Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week."
92581,L504275,u2734,m178,GARY,When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
92582,L504274,u2738,m178,MILES,Gary.
92583,L504273,u2734,m178,GARY,"Hey, Miles. Long time no see."
92584,L504176,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?"
92585,L504175,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do."
92586,L504174,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?"
92587,L504173,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
92588,L504172,u2735,m178,JACK,"Two years ago, buddy."
92589,L504167,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
92590,L504166,u2735,m178,JACK,"Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something."
92591,L504165,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,Spray and Wash. That's the one.
92592,L504164,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash."
92593,L504163,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?"
92594,L504154,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
92595,L504153,u2735,m178,JACK,Is it chicken?
92596,L504152,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,They're just leftovers.
92597,L504151,u2735,m178,JACK,"Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious."
92598,L504144,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?"
92599,L504143,u2735,m178,JACK,"You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond."
92600,L504142,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on."
92601,L504141,u2735,m178,JACK,"Yeah, well, you should be my agent."
92602,L504140,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin."
92603,L504139,u2735,m178,JACK,"Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago."
92604,L504136,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
92605,L504135,u2735,m178,JACK,They're from both of us.
92606,L504920,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
92607,L504919,u2735,m178,JACK,I can explain.
92608,L504557,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
92609,L504556,u2735,m178,JACK,Hi.
92610,L504555,u2735,m178,JACK,"Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here."
92611,L504554,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,What happened to you guys?
92612,L504502,u2735,m178,JACK,Me too.
92613,L504501,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,I'm thinking about the duck breast.
92614,L504476,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Not so bad yourself.
92615,L504475,u2735,m178,JACK,Great. You look great.  You both do.
92616,L504474,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Good. How're you?
92617,L504473,u2735,m178,JACK,"How you doin' tonight, beautiful?"
92618,L504441,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,I know. I might need to be spanked.
92619,L504440,u2735,m178,JACK,"You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie."
92620,L504437,u2735,m178,JACK,No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
92621,L504436,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Sure I know Maya. Real well.
92622,L504435,u2735,m178,JACK,You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
92623,L504434,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Oh yeah.
92624,L504433,u2735,m178,JACK,Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
92625,L504432,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
92626,L504431,u2735,m178,JACK,"Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?"
92627,L504425,u2735,m178,JACK,Nice.
92628,L504424,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Stephanie.
92629,L504423,u2735,m178,JACK,Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
92630,L504417,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,That's what people say.
92631,L504416,u2735,m178,JACK,"Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah."
92632,L504415,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,"Hey, guys. How's it going?"
92633,L504496,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Well, in that case..."
92634,L504495,u2735,m178,JACK,I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
92635,L504494,u2737,m178,MAYA,"No, we're paying for the wine."
92636,L504493,u2735,m178,JACK,Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
92637,L504337,u2737,m178,MAYA,You are not.
92638,L504336,u2735,m178,JACK,I am one of those guys.
92639,L504335,u2737,m178,MAYA,That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
92640,L504333,u2735,m178,JACK,Maybe. Recognize this?
92641,L504332,u2737,m178,MAYA,Anything I'd know?
92642,L504331,u2735,m178,JACK,A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
92643,L504330,u2737,m178,MAYA,Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
92644,L504329,u2735,m178,JACK,"No, I'm an actor."
92645,L504328,u2737,m178,MAYA,Are you a writer too?
92646,L504319,u2735,m178,JACK,That's on us.
92647,L504318,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Highliner, please."
92648,L504306,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles."
92649,L504305,u2735,m178,JACK,Hiya.
92650,L505058,u2735,m178,JACK,You were wearing your belt.
92651,L505057,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?"
92652,L505056,u2735,m178,JACK,"Hey, don't pull away till they see the car."
92653,L505055,u2738,m178,MILES,Back at you.
92654,L505054,u2735,m178,JACK,"Love you, man."
92655,L505053,u2738,m178,MILES,Yeah.
92656,L505052,u2735,m178,JACK,So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
92657,L505051,u2738,m178,MILES,Uh-uh. You're on your own.
92658,L505050,u2735,m178,JACK,Why don't you come in?
92659,L505049,u2738,m178,MILES,Well. That about does it.
92660,L505045,u2738,m178,MILES,"No, not whatever. You fucking derelict."
92661,L505044,u2735,m178,JACK,Whatever. Sorry.
92662,L505043,u2738,m178,MILES,You broke some.
92663,L505041,u2735,m178,JACK,You need a new car anyway.
92664,L505040,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't."
92665,L505039,u2735,m178,JACK,I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
92666,L505038,u2738,m178,MILES,Look at this!
92667,L505037,u2735,m178,JACK,I'll pay for it.
92668,L505036,u2738,m178,MILES,What the fuck!
92669,L505035,u2735,m178,JACK,You said it looked like a car accident.
92670,L505034,u2738,m178,MILES,What the fuck!
92671,L505033,u2735,m178,JACK,"Nothing. Buckle up, okay?"
92672,L505032,u2738,m178,MILES,What's wrong?
92673,L505031,u2735,m178,JACK,I feel like driving.
92674,L505030,u2738,m178,MILES,I'm fine. You rest.
92675,L505029,u2735,m178,JACK,"Come on, let me drive."
92676,L505028,u2735,m178,JACK,You're so negative.
92677,L505027,u2738,m178,MILES,"Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again."
92678,L505026,u2735,m178,JACK,"Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?"
92679,L505025,u2738,m178,MILES,"No, I'm okay."
92680,L505024,u2735,m178,JACK,Want me to drive?
92681,L505023,u2738,m178,MILES,Quite a week.
92682,L505022,u2735,m178,JACK,Yep. Quite a day.
92683,L505021,u2738,m178,MILES,That was quite a day yesterday.
92684,L505020,u2735,m178,JACK,Hrnrnrn?
92685,L505019,u2738,m178,MILES,"Hey, Jack. Jack."
92686,L505005,u2738,m178,MILES,Hold on.
92687,L505004,u2735,m178,JACK,Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
92688,L505003,u2735,m178,JACK,"Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that."
92689,L505002,u2738,m178,MILES,"Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering..."
92690,L505001,u2735,m178,JACK,My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
92691,L505000,u2738,m178,MILES,Me?
92692,L504999,u2735,m178,JACK,The plan is... you go.
92693,L504998,u2738,m178,MILES,So what's the plan?
92694,L504996,u2735,m178,JACK,Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
92695,L504995,u2738,m178,MILES,"Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say."
92696,L504994,u2735,m178,JACK,Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
92697,L504993,u2738,m178,MILES,So what the fuck were you thinking?
92698,L504992,u2735,m178,JACK,Yeah.
92699,L504991,u2738,m178,MILES,She tell you she was married?
92700,L504988,u2738,m178,MILES,Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
92701,L504987,u2735,m178,JACK,"Please, Miles, please."
92702,L504986,u2738,m178,MILES,No way. No way.
92703,L504985,u2735,m178,JACK,No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
92704,L504984,u2738,m178,MILES,"Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand."
92705,L504983,u2735,m178,JACK,You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
92706,L504982,u2738,m178,MILES,Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
92707,L504981,u2735,m178,JACK,"I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back."
92708,L504980,u2738,m178,MILES,What?
92709,L504979,u2735,m178,JACK,We gotta go back.
92710,L504978,u2735,m178,JACK,Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
92711,L504977,u2738,m178,MILES,"That's five clicks, Jackson."
92712,L504976,u2735,m178,JACK,Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
92713,L504975,u2738,m178,MILES,"Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?"
92714,L504974,u2735,m178,JACK,"Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass."
92715,L504973,u2738,m178,MILES,What?
92716,L504972,u2735,m178,JACK,Fucking chick's married.
92717,L504968,u2738,m178,MILES,"You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?"
92718,L504967,u2735,m178,JACK,"She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe."
92719,L504955,u2738,m178,MILES,I don't know. I wouldn't know.
92720,L504954,u2735,m178,JACK,"I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type."
92721,L504949,u2738,m178,MILES,Uh-huh.
92722,L504948,u2735,m178,JACK,I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
92723,L504947,u2738,m178,MILES,What's that?
92724,L504946,u2735,m178,JACK,You know what I'm thinking?
92725,L504944,u2738,m178,MILES,Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
92726,L504943,u2735,m178,JACK,What's it look like to you?
92727,L504941,u2738,m178,MILES,"Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot."
92728,L504940,u2735,m178,JACK,You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
92729,L504939,u2738,m178,MILES,Huh. Let me think.
92730,L504938,u2735,m178,JACK,So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
92731,L504934,u2735,m178,JACK,Yeah.
92732,L504933,u2738,m178,MILES,That's thoughtful.
92733,L504932,u2735,m178,JACK,Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
92734,L504931,u2738,m178,MILES,Good thing you have a voice-over career.
92735,L504930,u2735,m178,JACK,I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
92736,L504929,u2738,m178,MILES,Well?
92737,L504926,u2738,m178,MILES,Keep it elevated.
92738,L504925,u2735,m178,JACK,You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
92739,L504924,u2738,m178,MILES,"No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night."
92740,L504923,u2735,m178,JACK,"Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?"
92741,L504922,u2738,m178,MILES,Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
92742,L504912,u2738,m178,MILES,Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
92743,L504911,u2735,m178,JACK,See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
92744,L504910,u2738,m178,MILES,"Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage."
92745,L504909,u2735,m178,JACK,Don't give up. You're going to make it.
92746,L504908,u2738,m178,MILES,Thanks.
92747,L504907,u2735,m178,JACK,"What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is."
92748,L504906,u2738,m178,MILES,"You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published."
92749,L504905,u2735,m178,JACK,What's that supposed to mean?
92750,L504904,u2738,m178,MILES,"No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself."
92751,L504903,u2735,m178,JACK,"Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?"
92752,L504874,u2738,m178,MILES,I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
92753,L504873,u2735,m178,JACK,What's up?
92754,L504872,u2738,m178,MILES,Let me use your phone.
92755,L504871,u2735,m178,JACK,"I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot."
92756,L504870,u2738,m178,MILES,"Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid."
92757,L504869,u2735,m178,JACK,I say we check it out. You never know.
92758,L504868,u2738,m178,MILES,I don't have to.
92759,L504867,u2735,m178,JACK,"You ever actually been in there, Miles?"
92760,L504866,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke."
92761,L504865,u2735,m178,JACK,How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
92762,L504861,u2738,m178,MILES,Are they too sporty?
92763,L504860,u2735,m178,JACK,"Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty."
92764,L504859,u2738,m178,MILES,Do you like them?
92765,L504857,u2735,m178,JACK,I know what you need.
92766,L504856,u2738,m178,MILES,We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
92767,L504855,u2735,m178,JACK,Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
92768,L504854,u2738,m178,MILES,This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
92769,L504849,u2738,m178,MILES,"Shut up! Shut up, Jack!"
92770,L504848,u2735,m178,JACK,"Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's..."
92771,L504847,u2735,m178,JACK,Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
92772,L504846,u2738,m178,MILES,"Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up."
92773,L504845,u2735,m178,JACK,"You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo."
92774,L504844,u2738,m178,MILES,Let's leave it alone.
92775,L504843,u2735,m178,JACK,"You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot."
92776,L504842,u2738,m178,MILES,It's private.
92777,L504841,u2735,m178,JACK,What?
92778,L504840,u2738,m178,MILES,No.
92779,L504839,u2735,m178,JACK,So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
92780,L504836,u2738,m178,MILES,"Put me down, Jack."
92781,L504835,u2735,m178,JACK,"Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?"
92782,L504810,u2735,m178,JACK,Huh.
92783,L504809,u2738,m178,MILES,"He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted."
92784,L504808,u2735,m178,JACK,You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
92785,L504801,u2735,m178,JACK,I SAID OKAY?
92786,L504800,u2738,m178,MILES,You have to tell me --
92787,L504799,u2735,m178,JACK,I said okay?
92788,L504798,u2738,m178,MILES,What exactly are we going to do?
92789,L504797,u2735,m178,JACK,We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
92790,L504796,u2738,m178,MILES,What's happening?
92791,L504795,u2735,m178,JACK,We're on.
92792,L504793,u2735,m178,JACK,Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
92793,L504792,u2738,m178,MILES,Slaughterhouse.
92794,L504791,u2735,m178,JACK,Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
92795,L504790,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir."
92796,L504789,u2735,m178,JACK,With Maya.
92797,L504788,u2738,m178,MILES,Is what the money thing?
92798,L504787,u2735,m178,JACK,Is it the money thing?
92799,L504785,u2735,m178,JACK,All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
92800,L504784,u2738,m178,MILES,I don't want to talk about it.
92801,L504783,u2735,m178,JACK,Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
92802,L504779,u2738,m178,MILES,Throw me his ball.
92803,L504778,u2735,m178,JACK,"Hey, asshole! That's not cool!"
92804,L504777,u2738,m178,MILES,Fucker hit into us.
92805,L504773,u2735,m178,JACK,I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
92806,L504772,u2738,m178,MILES,What is it?
92807,L504771,u2735,m178,JACK,"Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here."
92808,L504770,u2738,m178,MILES,"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!"
92809,L504769,u2735,m178,JACK,"Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet."
92810,L504768,u2738,m178,MILES,Shut up.
92811,L504767,u2735,m178,JACK,Don't come over the top. Stay still.
92812,L504765,u2735,m178,JACK,"But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?"
92813,L504764,u2738,m178,MILES,They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
92814,L504763,u2735,m178,JACK,Huh.
92815,L504762,u2738,m178,MILES,Obsessively.
92816,L504761,u2735,m178,JACK,Been checking your messages?
92817,L504760,u2738,m178,MILES,Could be anything.
92818,L504759,u2735,m178,JACK,What do you think's going on?
92819,L504758,u2738,m178,MILES,Nope.
92820,L504757,u2735,m178,JACK,What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
92821,L504756,u2738,m178,MILES,You're an asshole.
92822,L504755,u2735,m178,JACK,Nice shot.
92823,L504753,u2738,m178,MILES,"Thanks, Jack."
92824,L504752,u2735,m178,JACK,"You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot."
92825,L504751,u2735,m178,JACK,Oh yeah. Sure.
92826,L504750,u2738,m178,MILES,Can you give me some room here?
92827,L504749,u2735,m178,JACK,"She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you."
92828,L504748,u2738,m178,MILES,Nope.
92829,L504747,u2735,m178,JACK,Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
92830,L504745,u2735,m178,JACK,She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
92831,L504744,u2738,m178,MILES,That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
92832,L504728,u2738,m178,MILES,Yeah.
92833,L504727,u2735,m178,JACK,Call me on my cell if you go out.
92834,L504723,u2738,m178,MILES,"Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie."
92835,L504722,u2735,m178,JACK,"Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?"
92836,L504718,u2735,m178,JACK,"Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong."
92837,L504717,u2738,m178,MILES,That was three years ago after that first party!
92838,L504716,u2735,m178,JACK,"You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche."
92839,L504715,u2738,m178,MILES,What? Of course I like Christine.
92840,L504714,u2735,m178,JACK,What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
92841,L504713,u2738,m178,MILES,You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
92842,L504712,u2735,m178,JACK,"Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even."
92843,L504711,u2738,m178,MILES,And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
92844,L504710,u2735,m178,JACK,"This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?"
92845,L504709,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?"
92846,L504708,u2735,m178,JACK,Look who's talking. You've been there.
92847,L504707,u2738,m178,MILES,In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
92848,L504706,u2735,m178,JACK,Like I might be in love with another woman.
92849,L504705,u2738,m178,MILES,Understanding of what?
92850,L504704,u2735,m178,JACK,I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
92851,L504702,u2738,m178,MILES,Deep.
92852,L504701,u2735,m178,JACK,"Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep."
92853,L504699,u2735,m178,JACK,I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
92854,L504698,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh, you've been thinking. And?"
92855,L504697,u2735,m178,JACK,"Well, I've been doing some thinking."
92856,L504696,u2738,m178,MILES,What?
92857,L504695,u2735,m178,JACK,"Well... I don't know, just... the wedding."
92858,L504694,u2738,m178,MILES,Besides what?
92859,L504693,u2735,m178,JACK,Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
92860,L504692,u2738,m178,MILES,Does she know about Saturday?
92861,L504691,u2738,m178,MILES,With this chick.
92862,L504690,u2735,m178,JACK,What?
92863,L504689,u2738,m178,MILES,What the fuck are you doing?
92864,L504688,u2735,m178,JACK,Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
92865,L504687,u2738,m178,MILES,Where is Stephanie?
92866,L504684,u2735,m178,JACK,What're you drinking?
92867,L504683,u2738,m178,MILES,Yep.
92868,L504682,u2735,m178,JACK,"Hey, there you are."
92869,L504679,u2735,m178,JACK,Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
92870,L504678,u2738,m178,MILES,What'd Christine say?
92871,L504660,u2735,m178,JACK,Okay! Jesus!
92872,L504659,u2738,m178,MILES,Right now.
92873,L504658,u2735,m178,JACK,I will.  See ya!
92874,L504657,u2738,m178,MILES,You should call her.
92875,L504656,u2735,m178,JACK,Yeah. Okay.
92876,L504655,u2738,m178,MILES,She's been leaving messages here too.
92877,L504654,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oh, boy."
92878,L504653,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first."
92879,L504652,u2735,m178,JACK,Later.
92880,L504651,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude."
92881,L504650,u2738,m178,MILES,Count me out.
92882,L504649,u2735,m178,JACK,"You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --"
92883,L504648,u2738,m178,MILES,We were supposed to play golf.
92884,L504647,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike."
92885,L504645,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished."
92886,L504644,u2735,m178,JACK,"Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty."
92887,L504546,u2735,m178,JACK,"Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua."
92888,L504545,u2738,m178,MILES,Shut up. Shut your face.
92889,L504544,u2735,m178,JACK,And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
92890,L504543,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oh Jesus, Miles."
92891,L504542,u2738,m178,MILES,Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
92892,L504541,u2735,m178,JACK,"Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!"
92893,L504539,u2735,m178,JACK,Did you drink and dial?
92894,L504538,u2738,m178,MILES,Bathroom.
92895,L504537,u2735,m178,JACK,Where were you?
92896,L504536,u2738,m178,MILES,I'm fine!
92897,L504535,u2735,m178,JACK,"Pull yourself together, man."
92898,L504471,u2738,m178,MILES,Okay! Fuck!
92899,L504470,u2735,m178,JACK,And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
92900,L504469,u2735,m178,JACK,"Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?"
92901,L504468,u2738,m178,MILES,"If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!"
92902,L504467,u2735,m178,JACK,"And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot."
92903,L504466,u2738,m178,MILES,"Aye-aye, captain."
92904,L504465,u2735,m178,JACK,"Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me."
92905,L504464,u2738,m178,MILES,Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
92906,L504463,u2735,m178,JACK,"Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall."
92907,L504460,u2735,m178,JACK,I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
92908,L504459,u2738,m178,MILES,So what should I wear?
92909,L504456,u2738,m178,MILES,Nah. I want to watch this.
92910,L504455,u2735,m178,JACK,You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
92911,L504454,u2735,m178,JACK,Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
92912,L504453,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, she is cute."
92913,L504452,u2735,m178,JACK,"Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on."
92914,L504451,u2735,m178,JACK,"Been divorced for a year now, bud."
92915,L504450,u2738,m178,MILES,With Maya?
92916,L504449,u2735,m178,JACK,"She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out."
92917,L504448,u2738,m178,MILES,What?
92918,L504447,u2735,m178,JACK,We're on.
92919,L504446,u2738,m178,MILES,You have the keys.
92920,L504445,u2735,m178,JACK,Get the trunk.
92921,L504444,u2738,m178,MILES,Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
92922,L504443,u2735,m178,JACK,"A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked."
92923,L504419,u2735,m178,JACK,I'm a quick learner.
92924,L504418,u2738,m178,MILES,You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
92925,L504411,u2738,m178,MILES,You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
92926,L504410,u2735,m178,JACK,"No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool."
92927,L504409,u2738,m178,MILES,I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
92928,L504408,u2735,m178,JACK,Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
92929,L504407,u2738,m178,MILES,You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
92930,L504406,u2735,m178,JACK,What do you think?
92931,L504405,u2738,m178,MILES,Is she bringing him to the wedding?
92932,L504404,u2735,m178,JACK,You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
92933,L504403,u2738,m178,MILES,I want to go home now.
92934,L504402,u2735,m178,JACK,"Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!"
92935,L504400,u2738,m178,MILES,To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
92936,L504399,u2735,m178,JACK,About a month ago. Six weeks.
92937,L504398,u2738,m178,MILES,She what?  When?
92938,L504397,u2735,m178,JACK,"Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried."
92939,L504396,u2738,m178,MILES,I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
92940,L504395,u2735,m178,JACK,"Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding."
92941,L504394,u2738,m178,MILES,She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
92942,L504393,u2735,m178,JACK,Miles.
92943,L504392,u2738,m178,MILES,"Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care."
92944,L504391,u2735,m178,JACK,Beautiful.
92945,L504390,u2738,m178,MILES,"Nice, huh?"
92946,L504376,u2735,m178,JACK,"No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share."
92947,L504375,u2738,m178,MILES,"Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back."
92948,L504374,u2735,m178,JACK,Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
92949,L504373,u2738,m178,MILES,"Ooooh, now the cards are on the table."
92950,L504372,u2735,m178,JACK,"I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit."
92951,L504369,u2738,m178,MILES,"We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel."
92952,L504368,u2735,m178,JACK,So what's the plan today?
92953,L504367,u2738,m178,MILES,"So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The ""rancher's special breakfast""? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?"
92954,L504364,u2738,m178,MILES,Fuck you.
92955,L504363,u2735,m178,JACK,Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
92956,L504362,u2738,m178,MILES,Have you no shame?
92957,L504361,u2735,m178,JACK,"She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator."
92958,L504360,u2738,m178,MILES,Shut up.
92959,L504359,u2735,m178,JACK,Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
92960,L504358,u2735,m178,JACK,"No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock."
92961,L504357,u2738,m178,MILES,How do you know?
92962,L504356,u2735,m178,JACK,"Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married."
92963,L504355,u2738,m178,MILES,Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
92964,L504354,u2735,m178,JACK,"I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit."
92965,L504353,u2738,m178,MILES,"Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack."
92966,L504352,u2735,m178,JACK,The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
92967,L504351,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?"
92968,L504350,u2735,m178,JACK,"The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!"
92969,L504315,u2735,m178,JACK,"You're blind, dude. Blind."
92970,L504314,u2738,m178,MILES,She works for tips!
92971,L504313,u2735,m178,JACK,Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
92972,L504312,u2738,m178,MILES,"Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?"
92973,L504311,u2735,m178,JACK,Perfect.
92974,L504310,u2738,m178,MILES,And she likes Pinot.
92975,L504309,u2735,m178,JACK,Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
92976,L504308,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, she does know a lot about wine."
92977,L504307,u2735,m178,JACK,"Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?"
92978,L504298,u2738,m178,MILES,"You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot."
92979,L504297,u2735,m178,JACK,So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
92980,L504296,u2738,m178,MILES,This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
92981,L504295,u2735,m178,JACK,"Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?"
92982,L504294,u2738,m178,MILES,And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
92983,L504293,u2735,m178,JACK,She is very hot.
92984,L504292,u2738,m178,MILES,"Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half."
92985,L504291,u2735,m178,JACK,You know that chick?
92986,L504290,u2738,m178,MILES,Sure I know Maya.
92987,L504289,u2735,m178,JACK,You know her?
92988,L504288,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh, yeah. That's Maya."
92989,L504286,u2738,m178,MILES,It's going to be great. Here's to us.
92990,L504285,u2735,m178,JACK,Here's to my last week of freedom.
92991,L504284,u2738,m178,MILES,Pour us a couple.
92992,L504283,u2735,m178,JACK,Yeah. Tight.
92993,L504272,u2735,m178,JACK,Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
92994,L504271,u2738,m178,MILES,Then it's a good thing.
92995,L504270,u2735,m178,JACK,It does. Feels right.
92996,L504269,u2738,m178,MILES,If that's what feels right.
92997,L504268,u2735,m178,JACK,"We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down."
92998,L504267,u2738,m178,MILES,Uh-huh.
92999,L504266,u2735,m178,JACK,"No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along."
93000,L504265,u2738,m178,MILES,So you're going to stop acting?
93001,L504264,u2735,m178,JACK,"Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff."
93002,L504263,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life."
93003,L504262,u2735,m178,JACK,"Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it."
93004,L504261,u2738,m178,MILES,Whoa.
93005,L504260,u2735,m178,JACK,You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
93006,L504259,u2738,m178,MILES,Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
93007,L504258,u2735,m178,JACK,We should have driven.
93008,L504257,u2738,m178,MILES,It's not even a mile.
93009,L504256,u2735,m178,JACK,I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
93010,L504255,u2735,m178,JACK,Just a minute!
93011,L504254,u2738,m178,MILES,"Hey Jack, hurry up!"
93012,L504253,u2735,m178,JACK,Want some?
93013,L504252,u2738,m178,MILES,Are you chewing gum?
93014,L504251,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, that would be a good move."
93015,L504250,u2735,m178,JACK,"You know, you could work in a wine store."
93016,L504246,u2738,m178,MILES,"Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?"
93017,L504245,u2735,m178,JACK,How would you rate this one?
93018,L504244,u2738,m178,MILES,Now.
93019,L504243,u2735,m178,JACK,When do we get to drink it?
93020,L504242,u2738,m178,MILES,That's what you do with every one.
93021,L504240,u2738,m178,MILES,Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
93022,L504239,u2735,m178,JACK,"Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese."
93023,L504237,u2735,m178,JACK,I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
93024,L504236,u2738,m178,MILES,What do you smell?
93025,L504234,u2738,m178,MILES,"Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it."
93026,L504233,u2735,m178,JACK,Huh.
93027,L504232,u2738,m178,MILES,"Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever..."
93028,L504231,u2735,m178,JACK,What color is it supposed to be?
93029,L504230,u2738,m178,MILES,First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
93030,L504228,u2735,m178,JACK,"Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir."
93031,L504227,u2738,m178,MILES,"Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir."
93032,L504226,u2735,m178,JACK,"This is rose, right?"
93033,L504220,u2738,m178,MILES,Now we're talking.
93034,L504219,u2735,m178,JACK,Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
93035,L504214,u2735,m178,JACK,I owe her a call anyway.
93036,L504213,u2738,m178,MILES,Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
93037,L504212,u2735,m178,JACK,Let me call Christine.
93038,L504211,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference."
93039,L504210,u2735,m178,JACK,I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
93040,L504209,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?"
93041,L504208,u2735,m178,JACK,I told you. Filet and salmon.
93042,L504207,u2738,m178,MILES,So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
93043,L504206,u2738,m178,MILES,"Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are."
93044,L504205,u2735,m178,JACK,"Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells."
93045,L504203,u2738,m178,MILES,I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
93046,L504202,u2735,m178,JACK,I thought you hated Chardonnay.
93047,L504201,u2738,m178,MILES,These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
93048,L504200,u2735,m178,JACK,"Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass."
93049,L504199,u2738,m178,MILES,You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
93050,L504197,u2735,m178,JACK,And get your bone smooched.
93051,L504196,u2738,m178,MILES,"Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style."
93052,L504195,u2735,m178,JACK,"Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need."
93053,L504194,u2738,m178,MILES,"And Lexapro, yes."
93054,L504193,u2735,m178,JACK,"Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?"
93055,L504192,u2738,m178,MILES,I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
93056,L504191,u2735,m178,JACK,You still seeing that shrink?
93057,L504190,u2738,m178,MILES,I'm working on it.
93058,L504189,u2735,m178,JACK,"No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books."
93059,L504188,u2738,m178,MILES,I'd rather have a knife.
93060,L504187,u2735,m178,JACK,It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
93061,L504185,u2738,m178,MILES,It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
93062,L504184,u2735,m178,JACK,Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
93063,L504183,u2738,m178,MILES,As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
93064,L504182,u2735,m178,JACK,"That's your problem, Miles."
93065,L504181,u2738,m178,MILES,"She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore."
93066,L504180,u2735,m178,JACK,"Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?"
93067,L504169,u2735,m178,JACK,"And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man."
93068,L504168,u2738,m178,MILES,"This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you."
93069,L504148,u2735,m178,JACK,Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
93070,L504147,u2738,m178,MILES,"Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --"
93071,L504131,u2735,m178,JACK,That's a good age.
93072,L504130,u2738,m178,MILES,Um... seventy... something.
93073,L504129,u2735,m178,JACK,How old's she going to be?
93074,L504128,u2738,m178,MILES,"It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway."
93075,L504127,u2735,m178,JACK,"Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago."
93076,L504126,u2738,m178,MILES,I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
93077,L504125,u2735,m178,JACK,What?
93078,L504124,u2738,m178,MILES,I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
93079,L504123,u2735,m178,JACK,"Whoa, why are we getting off?"
93080,L504098,u2735,m178,JACK,"Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different."
93081,L504097,u2738,m178,MILES,There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
93082,L504096,u2735,m178,JACK,Oh yeah. Much better.
93083,L504095,u2738,m178,MILES,How about the new ending? Did you like that?
93084,L504094,u2735,m178,JACK,"I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something."
93085,L504093,u2738,m178,MILES,And?
93086,L504092,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
93087,L504091,u2738,m178,MILES,"Did you read the latest draft, by the way?"
93088,L504090,u2735,m178,JACK,Sure is tasty.
93089,L504089,u2738,m178,MILES,"Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color."
93090,L504088,u2735,m178,JACK,Just tell me.
93091,L504087,u2738,m178,MILES,Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
93092,L504086,u2735,m178,JACK,Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
93093,L504085,u2738,m178,MILES,100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
93094,L504084,u2735,m178,JACK,"Oh, that's tasty."
93095,L504083,u2738,m178,MILES,You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
93096,L504082,u2735,m178,JACK,Yeah.
93097,L504081,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together."
93098,L504080,u2735,m178,JACK,Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
93099,L504078,u2738,m178,MILES,That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
93100,L504077,u2735,m178,JACK,"Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it."
93101,L504076,u2738,m178,MILES,Don't open that now. It's warm.
93102,L504074,u2738,m178,MILES,"It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring."
93103,L504073,u2735,m178,JACK,I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
93104,L504072,u2738,m178,MILES,"...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already."
93105,L504071,u2735,m178,JACK,"Yeah, Conundrum."
93106,L504070,u2738,m178,MILES,"No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum..."
93107,L504069,u2735,m178,JACK,You said you had it all lined up.
93108,L504068,u2738,m178,MILES,Why did you tell them my book was being published?
93109,L504067,u2738,m178,MILES,"Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box."
93110,L504066,u2735,m178,JACK,Come on. You're fucking hungover.
93111,L504065,u2738,m178,MILES,I can't help the traffic.
93112,L504064,u2735,m178,JACK,"Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now."
93113,L504928,u2738,m178,MILES,"It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
93114,L504927,u2737,m178,MAYA,Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
93115,L504833,u2738,m178,MILES,"And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State."
93116,L504832,u2737,m178,MAYA,"You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine."
93117,L504831,u2737,m178,MAYA,Yeah.
93118,L504830,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh, Maya. No."
93119,L504829,u2737,m178,MAYA,But you wanted to fuck me first.
93120,L504828,u2738,m178,MILES,"Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but..."
93121,L504827,u2738,m178,MILES,I'm sure he believed every word.
93122,L504826,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to."
93123,L504825,u2738,m178,MILES,"He's an actor, so it can't be good."
93124,L504824,u2737,m178,MAYA,Do you know what he's been saying to her?
93125,L504823,u2738,m178,MILES,"I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control."
93126,L504822,u2737,m178,MAYA,Don't touch me. Just take me home.
93127,L504821,u2738,m178,MILES,Maya.
93128,L504820,u2738,m178,MILES,"Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth."
93129,L504819,u2737,m178,MAYA,Were you ever going to say anything?
93130,L504817,u2737,m178,MAYA,What rehearsal dinner?
93131,L504816,u2738,m178,MILES,"No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner."
93132,L504815,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?"
93133,L504814,u2738,m178,MILES,Okay.
93134,L504813,u2737,m178,MAYA,About two-thirty.
93135,L504812,u2738,m178,MILES,Great. What's the latest we can get there?
93136,L504811,u2737,m178,MAYA,You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
93137,L504807,u2737,m178,MAYA,You too.
93138,L504806,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, nice to see you now."
93139,L504805,u2737,m178,MAYA,I had class.
93140,L504804,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you."
93141,L504803,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me."
93142,L504642,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Goodnight, Miles."
93143,L504641,u2738,m178,MILES,Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
93144,L504639,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course."
93145,L504638,u2738,m178,MILES,Um... did you still want to read my novel?
93146,L504637,u2737,m178,MAYA,Okay. See you around.
93147,L504636,u2738,m178,MILES,Good. So did I.
93148,L504635,u2737,m178,MAYA,"I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did."
93149,L504634,u2738,m178,MILES,Got it.
93150,L504633,u2737,m178,MAYA,"You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?"
93151,L504628,u2737,m178,MAYA,Yeah.
93152,L504627,u2738,m178,MILES,Bathroom over there?
93153,L504625,u2737,m178,MAYA,Like what a fraud he was.
93154,L504624,u2738,m178,MILES,Yeah? Like what?
93155,L504623,u2737,m178,MAYA,"I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about."
93156,L504622,u2738,m178,MILES,I don't know. Why are you into wine?
93157,L504621,u2737,m178,MAYA,What about me?
93158,L504620,u2738,m178,MILES,"I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?"
93159,L504618,u2737,m178,MAYA,Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
93160,L504617,u2738,m178,MILES,Sure.
93161,L504616,u2737,m178,MAYA,Can I ask you a personal question?
93162,L504615,u2738,m178,MILES,"My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good."
93163,L504614,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?"
93164,L504613,u2738,m178,MILES,"I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos..."
93165,L504612,u2737,m178,MAYA,Well...
93166,L504611,u2738,m178,MILES,So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
93167,L504610,u2737,m178,MAYA,I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
93168,L504609,u2738,m178,MILES,Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
93169,L504608,u2737,m178,MAYA,Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
93170,L504607,u2738,m178,MILES,A paper?
93171,L504606,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes."
93172,L504605,u2738,m178,MILES,Yeah. Thanks.
93173,L504604,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even."
93174,L504603,u2738,m178,MILES,"Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution."
93175,L504602,u2737,m178,MAYA,"So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?"
93176,L504601,u2738,m178,MILES,Um... yeah but it's more...
93177,L504600,u2737,m178,MAYA,Oh. You mean... today?
93178,L504599,u2738,m178,MILES,"""The Day After Yesterday."""
93179,L504598,u2737,m178,MAYA,What's the title?
93180,L504597,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely."
93181,L504596,u2737,m178,MAYA,So what's your novel about?
93182,L504595,u2738,m178,MILES,Yeah. Definitely.
93183,L504594,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Yeah, weird. But great."
93184,L504593,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context."
93185,L504592,u2737,m178,MAYA,It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
93186,L504589,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Yeah, same here."
93187,L504588,u2738,m178,MILES,"Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids."
93188,L504587,u2737,m178,MAYA,You got kids?
93189,L504585,u2737,m178,MAYA,"She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie."
93190,L504584,u2738,m178,MILES,Is she sleeping or...?
93191,L504583,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Yeah, Siena's a sweetie."
93192,L504582,u2738,m178,MILES,Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
93193,L504581,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money."
93194,L504580,u2737,m178,MAYA,I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
93195,L504579,u2738,m178,MILES,"Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?"
93196,L504578,u2737,m178,MAYA,Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
93197,L504577,u2738,m178,MILES,What was the bottle that did it?
93198,L504576,u2737,m178,MAYA,I started to get serious about seven years ago.
93199,L504575,u2738,m178,MILES,How long have you been into wine?
93200,L504574,u2737,m178,MAYA,"The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion."
93201,L504573,u2738,m178,MILES,I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
93202,L504572,u2737,m178,MAYA,It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
93203,L504571,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, I know."
93204,L504570,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read."
93205,L504569,u2737,m178,MAYA,You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
93206,L504568,u2738,m178,MILES,"Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc."
93207,L504567,u2737,m178,MAYA,So what gems do you have in your collection?
93208,L504561,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?"
93209,L504560,u2738,m178,MILES,She got anything good?
93210,L504559,u2737,m178,MAYA,Hey.
93211,L504558,u2738,m178,MILES,Hi.
93212,L504530,u2738,m178,MILES,Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
93213,L504529,u2737,m178,MAYA,Are you all right?
93214,L504500,u2738,m178,MILES,That's what I'm having.
93215,L504499,u2737,m178,MAYA,I'm having the salmon.
93216,L504486,u2737,m178,MAYA,I know. I love that.
93217,L504485,u2738,m178,MILES,This is good. Little hints of clove.
93218,L504484,u2737,m178,MAYA,I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
93219,L504483,u2738,m178,MILES,On a Sauvignon Blanc?
93220,L504482,u2737,m178,MAYA,Twelve months in oak.
93221,L504481,u2738,m178,MILES,Nice. Very nice.
93222,L504480,u2737,m178,MAYA,Try it.
93223,L504479,u2738,m178,MILES,Oh yeah? How is it?
93224,L504478,u2737,m178,MAYA,A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
93225,L504477,u2738,m178,MILES,What are you drinking?
93226,L504347,u2738,m178,MILES,See you.
93227,L504346,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack."
93228,L504344,u2738,m178,MILES,The Windmill.
93229,L504343,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?"
93230,L504325,u2737,m178,MAYA,Good for you.
93231,L504324,u2738,m178,MILES,I finished it.
93232,L504323,u2737,m178,MAYA,"So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked."
93233,L504322,u2737,m178,MAYA,Sure.
93234,L504321,u2738,m178,MILES,You want to join us?
93235,L504304,u2738,m178,MILES,"You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya."
93236,L504303,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?"
93237,L504302,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh, no, actually. Busy night."
93238,L504301,u2737,m178,MAYA,"I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?"
93239,L504300,u2738,m178,MILES,"Maya, how are you?"
93240,L504299,u2737,m178,MAYA,"Hey, Miles. Good to see you."
93241,L505084,u2738,m178,MILES,Yeah.
93242,L505083,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"See you over there, Miles."
93243,L505082,u2738,m178,MILES,"Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news."
93244,L505081,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,I'm pregnant.
93245,L505080,u2738,m178,MILES,You quit drinking?
93246,L505079,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,Not me. I'm not drinking.
93247,L505078,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds."
93248,L505077,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,I guess.
93249,L505076,u2738,m178,MILES,"Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess."
93250,L505075,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,I am.
93251,L505074,u2738,m178,MILES,"Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy."
93252,L505073,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?"
93253,L505072,u2738,m178,MILES,Universally rejected. Strike three.
93254,L505071,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,So what's happening with your book?
93255,L505070,u2738,m178,MILES,Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
93256,L505069,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,So how're you doing?
93257,L505068,u2738,m178,MILES,That's great.
93258,L505067,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate."
93259,L505066,u2738,m178,MILES,That was big of him.
93260,L505061,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband."
93261,L505060,u2738,m178,MILES,"Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful."
93262,L504526,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding."
93263,L504525,u2738,m178,MILES,"I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --"
93264,L504524,u2738,m178,MILES,"You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe."
93265,L504523,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"I'm going to hang up now, Miles."
93266,L504522,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun."
93267,L504521,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not."
93268,L504520,u2738,m178,MILES,Ken.
93269,L504519,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,Ken.
93270,L504518,u2738,m178,MILES,"I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?"
93271,L504517,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Miles, don't call me when you're drunk."
93272,L504516,u2738,m178,MILES,Hello?
93273,L504515,u2738,m178,MILES,A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
93274,L504514,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,Where are you?
93275,L504513,u2738,m178,MILES,"Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!"
93276,L504512,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Oh, Miles. You're drunk."
93277,L504511,u2738,m178,MILES,Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
93278,L504510,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,"Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?"
93279,L504509,u2738,m178,MILES,Victoria! How the hell are you?
93280,L504508,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,Miles?
93281,L504507,u2738,m178,MILES,Victoria.
93282,L504506,u2742,m178,VICTORIA,Hello?
93283,L504899,u2740,m178,POURER,Then buy a bottle and go outside.
93284,L504898,u2738,m178,MILES,I told you I need a drink.
93285,L504897,u2740,m178,POURER,"Sir, what are you doing?"
93286,L504895,u2740,m178,POURER,"This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar."
93287,L504894,u2738,m178,MILES,Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
93288,L504388,u2738,m178,MILES,Good stuff.
93289,L504387,u2740,m178,POURER,Both.
93290,L504386,u2738,m178,MILES,French or American?
93291,L504385,u2740,m178,POURER,About a year.
93292,L504384,u2738,m178,MILES,Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
93293,L504383,u2740,m178,POURER,About four weeks.
93294,L504382,u2738,m178,MILES,How much skin and stem contact?
93295,L504918,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
93296,L504917,u2738,m178,MILES,Stephanie! Stop!
93297,L504725,u2738,m178,MILES,"Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl."
93298,L504724,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,"See you, Miles. You take care."
93299,L504720,u2738,m178,MILES,Where?
93300,L504719,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,"Hi, guys. We should probably get going."
93301,L504675,u2738,m178,MILES,Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
93302,L504674,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,"Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once."
93303,L504673,u2738,m178,MILES,You golf?
93304,L504672,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Oops. Sorry.
93305,L504671,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago."
93306,L504670,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Huh.
93307,L504669,u2738,m178,MILES,"Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing."
93308,L504668,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,"So what are you up to today, Miles?"
93309,L504667,u2738,m178,MILES,He had to make a phone call.
93310,L504666,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Where's Jack?
93311,L504665,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,"Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her."
93312,L504664,u2738,m178,MILES,Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
93313,L504663,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,That was fun last night.
93314,L504563,u2738,m178,MILES,She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
93315,L504562,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
93316,L504548,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,"We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever."
93317,L504547,u2738,m178,MILES,Should we get dessert?
93318,L504498,u2738,m178,MILES,Exactement!
93319,L504497,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
93320,L504430,u2738,m178,MILES,"Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --"
93321,L504429,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
93322,L504427,u2738,m178,MILES,Quaffable but far from transcendent.
93323,L504426,u2741,m178,STEPHANIE,So what do you think?
93324,L504171,u2738,m178,MILES,I just got divorced. Phyllis.
93325,L504170,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"Miles, when are you going to get married again?"
93326,L504161,u2738,m178,MILES,Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
93327,L504160,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday."
93328,L504159,u2738,m178,MILES,"Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes."
93329,L504158,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
93330,L504157,u2738,m178,MILES,You talked to Wendy?
93331,L504156,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming."
93332,L504155,u2738,m178,MILES,"It was a surprise, Mom."
93333,L504138,u2739,m178,PHYLLIS,"Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby."
93334,L504137,u2738,m178,MILES,A famous actor who's getting married next week.
93335,L505798,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Don't touch him.
93336,L505797,u2743,m179,BO,Daddy.
93337,L505360,u2743,m179,BO,No dad!
93338,L505359,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
93339,L505241,u2743,m179,BO,Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
93340,L505240,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,This one?
93341,L505239,u2743,m179,BO,A hair.
93342,L505238,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,This one?
93343,L505237,u2743,m179,BO,There's dust in it.
93344,L505175,u2743,m179,BO,She doesn't answer me either.
93345,L505174,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,No.
93346,L505173,u2743,m179,BO,Does she ever answer back?
93347,L505172,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It makes me feel better.
93348,L505171,u2743,m179,BO,Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
93349,L505170,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What are you thinking about?
93350,L505169,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Right.
93351,L505168,u2743,m179,BO,Only for pee or poop.
93352,L505167,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
93353,L505166,u2743,m179,BO,It tastes old.
93354,L505165,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
93355,L505164,u2743,m179,BO,I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
93356,L505163,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What's the matter?
93357,L505160,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
93358,L505159,u2743,m179,BO,Houdini's sick.
93359,L505581,u2743,m179,BO,Me too.
93360,L505580,u2748,m179,MORGAN,I'm scared.
93361,L505478,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Who said I was going to die?
93362,L505477,u2743,m179,BO,I don't want you to die.
93363,L505462,u2748,m179,MORGAN,That's weird.
93364,L505461,u2743,m179,BO,The same windows.
93365,L505404,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Dad!
93366,L505403,u2743,m179,BO,My ballet recital.
93367,L505402,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
93368,L505350,u2743,m179,BO,I heard them Morgan.
93369,L505349,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
93370,L505126,u2748,m179,MORGAN,He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
93371,L505125,u2743,m179,BO,It tastes funny.
93372,L505124,u2748,m179,MORGAN,It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
93373,L505123,u2748,m179,MORGAN,You don't even know what that word means.
93374,L505122,u2743,m179,BO,I think it's contaminated.
93375,L505779,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
93376,L505778,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,And tell Merrill to swing away.
93377,L505777,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
93378,L505776,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I'm here.
93379,L505775,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,...Tell Graham --
93380,L505774,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,...I will.
93381,L505773,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
93382,L505772,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,...I will.
93383,L505771,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
93384,L505770,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Good.
93385,L505769,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,I don't feel much.
93386,L505768,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Does it hurt?
93387,L505766,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,You love walks.
93388,L505765,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,I was just taking a walk before dinner.
93389,L505764,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Hi baby.
93390,L505763,u2744,m179,COLLEEN,Hi sweetie.
93391,L505307,u2745,m179,CREWCUT GUY,"Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?"
93392,L505306,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Five. The five longest.
93393,L505305,u2745,m179,CREWCUT GUY,You got two minor league home run records don't you?
93394,L505304,u2747,m179,MERRILL,I got the bat at home... On the wall.
93395,L505299,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Clear for what?
93396,L505298,u2745,m179,CREWCUT GUY,"It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear..."
93397,L505297,u2747,m179,MERRILL,I see.
93398,L505296,u2745,m179,CREWCUT GUY,"I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away."
93399,L505295,u2747,m179,MERRILL,You do?
93400,L505800,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Don't.
93401,L505799,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Graham.
93402,L505796,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Graham.
93403,L505795,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Don't touch him.
93404,L505731,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Me too.
93405,L505730,u2747,m179,MERRILL,That's good enough for me.
93406,L505728,u2747,m179,MERRILL,"I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham."
93407,L505727,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
93408,L505726,u2747,m179,MERRILL,"Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?"
93409,L505725,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Have they said anything about our area?
93410,L505724,u2747,m179,MERRILL,He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
93411,L505722,u2747,m179,MERRILL,"Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious."
93412,L505721,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,No.
93413,L505719,u2747,m179,MERRILL,A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
93414,L505718,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,How do they know it's over?
93415,L505717,u2747,m179,MERRILL,They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
93416,L505716,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,How many died?
93417,L505714,u2747,m179,MERRILL,It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
93418,L505713,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,They're broadcasting...
93419,L505676,u2747,m179,MERRILL,I'm close.
93420,L505675,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It's getting stronger.
93421,L505674,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Me too.
93422,L505673,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I can feel air.
93423,L505664,u2747,m179,MERRILL,From what?
93424,L505663,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,They're distracting us?
93425,L505646,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Got it!
93426,L505645,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Merrill!
93427,L505643,u2747,m179,MERRILL,I'm looking!
93428,L505642,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Merrill --
93429,L505633,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
93430,L505632,u2747,m179,MERRILL,We won't be able to get out of there.
93431,L505625,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, ""No."" He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it."
93432,L505624,u2747,m179,MERRILL,What are you doing?
93433,L505623,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,He was only a year and half old.
93434,L505622,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,They're right behind the door.
93435,L505621,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Should we make a run for it out the back?
93436,L505620,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?"
93437,L505618,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,We have to go in the basement.
93438,L505617,u2747,m179,MERRILL,This is going to do nothing.
93439,L505608,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you."
93440,L505607,u2747,m179,MERRILL,They're on the roof.
93441,L505600,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,They already know we're here.
93442,L505599,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Should we turn off the lights?
93443,L505578,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
93444,L505577,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Chicken Teriyaki.
93445,L505532,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
93446,L505531,u2747,m179,MERRILL,"I'm sorry, what book is this?"
93447,L505469,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Ray Reddy's house.
93448,L505468,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Where are you going?
93449,L505438,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
93450,L505437,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
93451,L505436,u2747,m179,MERRILL,"They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion."
93452,L505433,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Eleven a.m. They're gone.
93453,L505432,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What time is it?
93454,L505431,u2747,m179,MERRILL,That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
93455,L505430,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"What's furry, furry rabbit?"
93456,L505429,u2747,m179,MERRILL,"For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?"
93457,L505423,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What does it matter then?
93458,L505422,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Yes.
93459,L505421,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Do you feel comforted?
93460,L505415,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
93461,L505414,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,That wasn't the answer you wanted?
93462,L505413,u2747,m179,MERRILL,How can you say that?
93463,L505412,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Yes.
93464,L505411,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Do you think it's a possibility?
93465,L505367,u2747,m179,MERRILL,I got him.
93466,L505366,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Morgan, be careful."
93467,L505352,u2747,m179,MERRILL,That's right.
93468,L505351,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
93469,L505339,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
93470,L505338,u2747,m179,MERRILL,It's noise.
93471,L505326,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
93472,L505325,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Pharmacy crowded?
93473,L505230,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high."
93474,L505229,u2747,m179,MERRILL,That roof is over ten feet high.
93475,L505228,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?"
93476,L505227,u2747,m179,MERRILL,This guy got on the roof in like a second.
93477,L505211,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Yes, it was."
93478,L505210,u2747,m179,MERRILL,It was very dark.
93479,L505201,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Yes it was.
93480,L505200,u2747,m179,MERRILL,It was very dark.
93481,L505198,u2747,m179,MERRILL,I heard.
93482,L505197,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I cursed.
93483,L505190,u2747,m179,MERRILL,You want him coming in the house next time?
93484,L505189,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,No I'm not.
93485,L505188,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Are you going to do this or what?
93486,L505187,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Explain noises.
93487,L505186,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Just make noises then.
93488,L505185,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
93489,L505184,u2747,m179,MERRILL,You don't mean it. It's just for show.
93490,L505183,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I'm not going to curse.
93491,L505182,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Curse and stuff.
93492,L505181,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Explain, act crazy?"
93493,L505179,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
93494,L505178,u2747,m179,MERRILL,"Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!"
93495,L505803,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Yeah baby. I think someone did.
93496,L505802,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Did someone save me?
93497,L505658,u2748,m179,MORGAN,I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
93498,L505657,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I can't even imagine.
93499,L505640,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,You're scaring your sister.
93500,L505639,u2748,m179,MORGAN,They'll read our minds!
93501,L505584,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Don't yell at her!
93502,L505583,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Stop crying!
93503,L505576,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
93504,L505575,u2748,m179,MORGAN,French toast... and mashed potatoes.
93505,L505568,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner."
93506,L505567,u2748,m179,MORGAN,What about Isabelle?
93507,L505566,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,The family room.
93508,L505565,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Where are we going to sleep?
93509,L505564,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
93510,L505537,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Sounds made up.
93511,L505536,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?"
93512,L505535,u2748,m179,MORGAN,They win.
93513,L505534,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What's two?
93514,L505533,u2748,m179,MORGAN,"They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later."
93515,L505530,u2748,m179,MORGAN,"Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them."
93516,L505529,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?"
93517,L505455,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I just asked his name.
93518,L505454,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Dad.
93519,L505453,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Bimboo?
93520,L505452,u2748,m179,MORGAN,"Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --"
93521,L505447,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,That means they're unemployed.
93522,L505446,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
93523,L505445,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Who wrote this book?
93524,L505444,u2748,m179,MORGAN,"It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet."
93525,L505443,u2748,m179,MORGAN,They tell you everything in this book.
93526,L505442,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Oh.
93527,L505441,u2748,m179,MORGAN,So the aliens can't read our minds.
93528,L505365,u2748,m179,MORGAN,"It gets clearer, the higher you hold it."
93529,L505364,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Morgan?
93530,L505344,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Don't do it.
93531,L505343,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I'm getting out now.
93532,L505341,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
93533,L505340,u2748,m179,MORGAN,We might lose the signal.
93534,L505252,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It's old Morgan.
93535,L505251,u2748,m179,MORGAN,It's still making the noises. It's broken.
93536,L505225,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I have some upstairs.
93537,L505224,u2748,m179,MORGAN,These are D's; I need double A's.
93538,L505220,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Edgar, come inside."
93539,L505219,u2748,m179,MORGAN,It needs batteries.
93540,L505218,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Yes.
93541,L505217,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
93542,L505759,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What did you say?
93543,L505758,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
93544,L505757,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Pinned? What does that mean?
93545,L505756,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,"See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two."
93546,L505755,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Why not?
93547,L505754,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,She's not in an ambulance Father.
93548,L505752,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
93549,L505751,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Is he okay?
93550,L505750,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
93551,L505749,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
93552,L505273,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,You take care of yourself...  Graham.
93553,L505272,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
93554,L505271,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,"It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine."
93555,L505270,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,And three weeks.
93556,L505269,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Six months.
93557,L505268,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,"But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago."
93558,L505250,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,No.
93559,L505249,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,Is anything missing?
93560,L505247,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,No.
93561,L505246,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
93562,L505245,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I don't think so.
93563,L505215,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,"Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious."
93564,L505214,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,"Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions."
93565,L505207,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,I would say so.
93566,L505206,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,Okay.  So he was tall?
93567,L505205,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,He definitely wasn't a midget.
93568,L505204,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
93569,L505203,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
93570,L505202,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
93571,L505151,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,"No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything."
93572,L505150,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Sounds like a virus.
93573,L505149,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
93574,L505148,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What was the first thing?
93575,L505147,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,Second thing this week I can't explain.
93576,L505144,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
93577,L505143,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,It's not broken.
93578,L505141,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,There are none.
93579,L505140,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,What about them?
93580,L505139,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,The footprints.
93581,L505138,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,You said something was strange. What's strange?
93582,L505137,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,Sorry.
93583,L505136,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
93584,L505135,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,What's that?
93585,L505134,u2746,m179,GRAHAM,Don't call me Father.
93586,L505133,u2749,m179,OFFICER PASKI,It's the strangest thing Father.
93587,L505667,u2748,m179,MORGAN,They'll find a way in.
93588,L505666,u2747,m179,MERRILL,What book!
93589,L505665,u2748,m179,MORGAN,The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
93590,L505558,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Don't worry.
93591,L505557,u2748,m179,MORGAN,"Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?"
93592,L505552,u2748,m179,MORGAN,They think it might happen all at once.
93593,L505551,u2747,m179,MERRILL,It's like War of the Worlds.
93594,L505550,u2748,m179,MORGAN,They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
93595,L505362,u2747,m179,MERRILL,You'll lose the signal!
93596,L505361,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Don't do it!
93597,L505328,u2747,m179,MERRILL,Yeah.
93598,L505327,u2748,m179,MORGAN,Is that him?
93599,L506071,u2750,m180,DAWSON,"What do you mean, the horses?"
93600,L506070,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses."
93601,L506069,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it."
93602,L506068,u2750,m180,DAWSON,"No money, eh?"
93603,L506067,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
93604,L506064,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job."
93605,L506063,u2750,m180,DAWSON,"You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die."
93606,L506062,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind."
93607,L506061,u2750,m180,DAWSON,Posse? What the hell you talking about?
93608,L506060,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
93609,L506145,u2756,m180,JAKE,It was my fault.
93610,L506144,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word."
93611,L506041,u2756,m180,JAKE,Your next water ain't for three days.
93612,L506040,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
93613,L506019,u2751,m180,EMMETT,There's nobody coming?
93614,L506018,u2756,m180,JAKE,I think we lost 'em.
93615,L505954,u2756,m180,JAKE,"Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me."
93616,L505953,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?"
93617,L505951,u2756,m180,JAKE,The one with the shotgun.
93618,L505950,u2751,m180,EMMETT,What friend is that?
93619,L505949,u2756,m180,JAKE,"Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me."
93620,L505948,u2751,m180,EMMETT,You're in here for winging a guy?
93621,L505947,u2756,m180,JAKE,"No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun."
93622,L505946,u2751,m180,EMMETT,...And you had to kill him?
93623,L505945,u2756,m180,JAKE,"So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back."
93624,L505944,u2756,m180,JAKE,"Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there."
93625,L505943,u2751,m180,EMMETT,That's why they got you in jail?
93626,L505942,u2756,m180,JAKE,All I did was kiss a girl.
93627,L505941,u2756,m180,JAKE,"You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here."
93628,L505940,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?"
93629,L505939,u2756,m180,JAKE,Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
93630,L506336,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie."
93631,L506335,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,Forget it.
93632,L506330,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,All right then.  Let's go.
93633,L506329,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Sounds good.
93634,L506328,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,"That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied."
93635,L506327,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Did it seem short to you?
93636,L506326,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,I didn't know you were out.
93637,L506325,u2751,m180,EMMETT,McKendrick.
93638,L506324,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,Emmett.
93639,L506568,u2760,m180,MAL,Right.
93640,L506567,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Gotta go.
93641,L506522,u2760,m180,MAL,"She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them."
93642,L506521,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Kate?
93643,L506518,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Is he alive?
93644,L506517,u2760,m180,MAL,McKendrick's men got him.
93645,L506516,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Where's Jake?
93646,L506515,u2760,m180,MAL,I almost didn't.
93647,L506406,u2760,m180,MAL,So far that's all I seen in this life.
93648,L506405,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
93649,L506404,u2760,m180,MAL,I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
93650,L506403,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Have to.
93651,L506402,u2760,m180,MAL,You'll never make it.
93652,L506401,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too."
93653,L506400,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'm sorry.
93654,L506399,u2760,m180,MAL,This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
93655,L506398,u2751,m180,EMMETT,That's it.
93656,L506397,u2760,m180,MAL,"I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it."
93657,L506396,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
93658,L506395,u2760,m180,MAL,Someplace safe. How you feeling?
93659,L506394,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Where are we?
93660,L506393,u2760,m180,MAL,Sure.
93661,L506392,u2751,m180,EMMETT,...Gotta go...
93662,L506098,u2760,m180,MAL,Yeah... maybe. So long.
93663,L506097,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Maybe we'll see you sometime.
93664,L506080,u2760,m180,MAL,Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
93665,L506079,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Where were you?
93666,L506078,u2760,m180,MAL,"After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time."
93667,L506572,u2751,m180,EMMETT,That I do.
93668,L506571,u2753,m180,HANNAH,This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
93669,L506570,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I already did that.
93670,L506569,u2753,m180,HANNAH,Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
93671,L506346,u2753,m180,HANNAH,Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
93672,L506345,u2751,m180,EMMETT,How's Mr. Parker doing?
93673,L506344,u2753,m180,HANNAH,We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
93674,L506343,u2753,m180,HANNAH,It's one thing to know it...
93675,L506342,u2751,m180,EMMETT,You must have known that before you came.
93676,L506341,u2753,m180,HANNAH,This is a brutal land.
93677,L506340,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Are you all right?
93678,L506315,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Yeah... that must have been it.
93679,L506314,u2753,m180,HANNAH,Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
93680,L506313,u2753,m180,HANNAH,Didn't Paden tell you that?
93681,L506312,u2751,m180,EMMETT,You don't make it easy on a fellow.
93682,L506310,u2751,m180,EMMETT,That's why I'm here.
93683,L506309,u2753,m180,HANNAH,"You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again."
93684,L506308,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon."
93685,L506307,u2753,m180,HANNAH,Goodbye?
93686,L506306,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I just came out to say goodbye.
93687,L506305,u2753,m180,HANNAH,I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
93688,L506304,u2753,m180,HANNAH,I guess I put a good scare into him.
93689,L506303,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Paden sends his best.
93690,L506302,u2753,m180,HANNAH,They've been kind to me.
93691,L506301,u2751,m180,EMMETT,The Parkers seem like nice folks.
93692,L506094,u2753,m180,HANNAH,Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
93693,L506093,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Have you thought at all about your plans?
93694,L506092,u2753,m180,HANNAH,More than enough.
93695,L506038,u2754,m180,HOBART,And they were two of them. Look --
93696,L506037,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters."
93697,L506036,u2754,m180,HOBART,This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
93698,L506035,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Hobart, what are you people doing here?"
93699,L505887,u2754,m180,HOBART,"And you're not Baxter, either?"
93700,L505886,u2751,m180,EMMETT,My name is Emmett.
93701,L505885,u2754,m180,HOBART,You're not Baxter?
93702,L505884,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley."
93703,L505883,u2754,m180,HOBART,I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
93704,L505987,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'll be long gone.
93705,L505986,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,I want you out of town before the hanging.
93706,L505985,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I haven't done anything.
93707,L505984,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
93708,L505964,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry."
93709,L505963,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,Ten A.M.
93710,L505962,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
93711,L505936,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig."
93712,L505935,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me."
93713,L505934,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
93714,L506575,u2762,m180,PADEN,I've got a job.
93715,L506574,u2751,m180,EMMETT,You might make a farmer yet.
93716,L506553,u2762,m180,PADEN,Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
93717,L506552,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'll see you around.
93718,L506221,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Pleased to meet you, Sheriff."
93719,L506220,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb."
93720,L506219,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'm going to California with my brother.
93721,L506218,u2762,m180,PADEN,"All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up."
93722,L506217,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Yeah?
93723,L506216,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living."
93724,L506103,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I'll be around.
93725,L506102,u2762,m180,PADEN,I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
93726,L506084,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in."
93727,L506083,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Where you been?
93728,L506057,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Anybody got any ideas?
93729,L506056,u2762,m180,PADEN,"You know, hanging around with you is no picnic."
93730,L505977,u2762,m180,PADEN,"All right, you buy me a drink."
93731,L505976,u2751,m180,EMMETT,You haven't got any money.
93732,L505975,u2762,m180,PADEN,"C'mon, I'll buy you a drink."
93733,L505974,u2751,m180,EMMETT,No hard feelings.
93734,L505973,u2762,m180,PADEN,Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
93735,L505972,u2751,m180,EMMETT,It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
93736,L505971,u2762,m180,PADEN,It's not going to be easy.
93737,L505970,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I understand.
93738,L505969,u2762,m180,PADEN,"You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more."
93739,L505968,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
93740,L505967,u2762,m180,PADEN,I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
93741,L505966,u2751,m180,EMMETT,He is that.
93742,L505965,u2762,m180,PADEN,Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
93743,L505913,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Which way do you mean?
93744,L505912,u2762,m180,PADEN,Doesn't look quite fair.
93745,L505879,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I expect.
93746,L505878,u2762,m180,PADEN,Women?
93747,L505877,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I expect.
93748,L505876,u2762,m180,PADEN,They got a saloon there?
93749,L505875,u2751,m180,EMMETT,It's a town...
93750,L505874,u2762,m180,PADEN,What's Turley like?
93751,L505873,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
93752,L505872,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Going to Turley, was it?"
93753,L505871,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I gotta be going.
93754,L505870,u2762,m180,PADEN,"And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat."
93755,L505869,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"I see what you like, she's mighty pretty."
93756,L505822,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Yeah, maybe a bath."
93757,L505821,u2762,m180,PADEN,Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
93758,L505820,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"South of here, past Chimayo."
93759,L505819,u2762,m180,PADEN,Where's Turley?
93760,L505818,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
93761,L505817,u2762,m180,PADEN,Where's the pinto going?
93762,L505816,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?"
93763,L505815,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck."
93764,L505814,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Looks like that's not all they admired.
93765,L505813,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay."
93766,L505812,u2751,m180,EMMETT,I had to get up anyway.
93767,L505811,u2762,m180,PADEN,I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
93768,L505810,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"No, Leavenworth."
93769,L505809,u2762,m180,PADEN,Jefferson City?
93770,L505808,u2751,m180,EMMETT,Not for five years.
93771,L505807,u2762,m180,PADEN,Offend anybody lately?
93772,L505806,u2762,m180,PADEN,You got no idea what they were after?
93773,L505805,u2751,m180,EMMETT,"Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around."
93774,L506158,u2760,m180,MAL,Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
93775,L506157,u2752,m180,EZRA,That's a lie.
93776,L506130,u2752,m180,EZRA,Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
93777,L506129,u2760,m180,MAL,What about the law?
93778,L506128,u2752,m180,EZRA,"I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land."
93779,L506127,u2760,m180,MAL,You own this land.
93780,L506126,u2752,m180,EZRA,"The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here."
93781,L506125,u2760,m180,MAL,Who?
93782,L506124,u2752,m180,EZRA,"They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway."
93783,L506123,u2760,m180,MAL,What happened?
93784,L506122,u2752,m180,EZRA,"She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you."
93785,L506121,u2760,m180,MAL,Where is Rae?
93786,L506118,u2752,m180,EZRA,I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
93787,L506117,u2760,m180,MAL,Daddy?
93788,L506114,u2753,m180,HANNAH,"I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman."
93789,L506113,u2762,m180,PADEN,What's that?
93790,L506112,u2753,m180,HANNAH,Because they don't like what I want.
93791,L506111,u2762,m180,PADEN,Why?
93792,L506110,u2753,m180,HANNAH,They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
93793,L506109,u2762,m180,PADEN,Believe it.
93794,L506108,u2753,m180,HANNAH,A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
93795,L506107,u2762,m180,PADEN,And a pretty lady.
93796,L506106,u2753,m180,HANNAH,"Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?"
93797,L506089,u2753,m180,HANNAH,"We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that."
93798,L506088,u2762,m180,PADEN,Never will again.
93799,L506087,u2753,m180,HANNAH,I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
93800,L506086,u2762,m180,PADEN,"He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us."
93801,L506148,u2757,m180,KATE,I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
93802,L506147,u2755,m180,J.T.,"His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free."
93803,L506146,u2757,m180,KATE,It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
93804,L506143,u2757,m180,KATE,"Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody."
93805,L506142,u2755,m180,J.T.,"The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick."
93806,L506141,u2757,m180,KATE,"Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people."
93807,L506135,u2755,m180,J.T.,Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
93808,L506134,u2757,m180,KATE,"J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced."
93809,L506538,u2762,m180,PADEN,Let's get out of here.
93810,L506537,u2756,m180,JAKE,New record.
93811,L506272,u2762,m180,PADEN,I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
93812,L506271,u2756,m180,JAKE,"What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?"
93813,L506270,u2762,m180,PADEN,That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
93814,L506269,u2756,m180,JAKE,All I did was kiss the girl.
93815,L506268,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Get out of here, Jake."
93816,L506032,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Oh, a guy who got run out of town..."
93817,L506031,u2756,m180,JAKE,Who is he?
93818,L506030,u2762,m180,PADEN,He is now.
93819,L506029,u2756,m180,JAKE,This a friend of yours?
93820,L506016,u2756,m180,JAKE,He'll be here.
93821,L506015,u2762,m180,PADEN,Where's your brother?
93822,L506014,u2756,m180,JAKE,We wait.
93823,L506013,u2762,m180,PADEN,What now?
93824,L506012,u2756,m180,JAKE,That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
93825,L505999,u2756,m180,JAKE,Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
93826,L505998,u2762,m180,PADEN,We didn't get that far.
93827,L505997,u2756,m180,JAKE,Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
93828,L505994,u2756,m180,JAKE,Right!
93829,L505993,u2762,m180,PADEN,The other guy drew first.
93830,L505992,u2756,m180,JAKE,"Yeah, that's what happened with me too."
93831,L505991,u2762,m180,PADEN,I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
93832,L505990,u2756,m180,JAKE,Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
93833,L505989,u2762,m180,PADEN,I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
93834,L505988,u2756,m180,JAKE,You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
93835,L506231,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Really?
93836,L506230,u2758,m180,KELLY,You can't do this.
93837,L506229,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I'm done talking. Get out.
93838,L506228,u2758,m180,KELLY,What are you talking about?
93839,L506227,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
93840,L506226,u2758,m180,KELLY,You wanted to see me?
93841,L506198,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
93842,L506197,u2758,m180,KELLY,Howdy.
93843,L506196,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden."
93844,L505926,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
93845,L505925,u2760,m180,MAL,That ain't right.
93846,L505924,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction."
93847,L505923,u2760,m180,MAL,Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
93848,L505922,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now."
93849,L505921,u2760,m180,MAL,I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
93850,L505920,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?"
93851,L505928,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"Don't press your luck, Carter."
93852,L505927,u2763,m180,PROPRIETOR,"Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?"
93853,L505918,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,Is that a fact?
93854,L505917,u2763,m180,PROPRIETOR,We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
93855,L505916,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"I don't like that word much, Carter."
93856,L505915,u2763,m180,PROPRIETOR,"This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston."
93857,L505914,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,What's all this then?
93858,L505958,u2762,m180,PADEN,I was afraid of that.
93859,L505957,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
93860,L505956,u2762,m180,PADEN,So this is the guy you're going to hang?
93861,L505955,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,The jury saw it differently.
93862,L505933,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?"
93863,L505932,u2762,m180,PADEN,You're kidding.
93864,L505931,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,"We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts."
93865,L505930,u2762,m180,PADEN,We'd rather stay.
93866,L505929,u2759,m180,LANGSTON,Now let's talk about you chaps.
93867,L506421,u2764,m180,RAE,"Shut up. You need help, don't you?"
93868,L506420,u2760,m180,MAL,Why him?
93869,L506418,u2764,m180,RAE,Because I'm your sister.
93870,L506417,u2760,m180,MAL,Why would they stop you?
93871,L506416,u2764,m180,RAE,What makes you think I could?
93872,L506415,u2760,m180,MAL,They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
93873,L506414,u2764,m180,RAE,What's stopping you?
93874,L506413,u2760,m180,MAL,Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
93875,L506412,u2764,m180,RAE,Why come to me?
93876,L506411,u2760,m180,MAL,"Rae, I need help."
93877,L506410,u2764,m180,RAE,Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
93878,L506295,u2764,m180,RAE,I don't have any family any more.
93879,L506294,u2760,m180,MAL,"Rae, all we got is each other."
93880,L506293,u2764,m180,RAE,It's none of your business.
93881,L506292,u2760,m180,MAL,"What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you."
93882,L506285,u2764,m180,RAE,"Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed."
93883,L506284,u2760,m180,MAL,"I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay."
93884,L506283,u2764,m180,RAE,Who did it?
93885,L506282,u2760,m180,MAL,He was murdered.
93886,L506281,u2760,m180,MAL,Daddy's dead.
93887,L506280,u2764,m180,RAE,What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
93888,L506279,u2760,m180,MAL,"Hello, Rae."
93889,L506443,u2762,m180,PADEN,Where's Emmett now?
93890,L506442,u2760,m180,MAL,"Yeah, it's working out real good."
93891,L506441,u2762,m180,PADEN,Lucky.
93892,L506440,u2760,m180,MAL,I got there just short of too late.
93893,L506438,u2760,m180,MAL,You don't know?
93894,L506437,u2762,m180,PADEN,I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
93895,L506436,u2760,m180,MAL,Because they enjoy it.
93896,L506435,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Why are they doing this, Mal?"
93897,L506096,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Good luck, Mal."
93898,L506095,u2760,m180,MAL,"This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock."
93899,L506353,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Did you hear his son is still around?
93900,L506352,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,I heard that too.
93901,L506351,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
93902,L506350,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,We'll handle that. He's careless.
93903,L506349,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,What about his brother?
93904,L506348,u2761,m180,MCKENDRICK,"He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it."
93905,L506347,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,He must be pretty good.
93906,L506565,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Good-bye, Paden."
93907,L506564,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb."
93908,L506563,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
93909,L506483,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt."
93910,L506482,u2762,m180,PADEN,What's she got to do with it?
93911,L506481,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella."
93912,L506480,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Cobb, you've got nothing I need."
93913,L506479,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
93914,L506478,u2762,m180,PADEN,I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
93915,L506477,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days."
93916,L506475,u2762,m180,PADEN,"We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb."
93917,L506474,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I thought we talked about that.
93918,L506473,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Yeah, maybe I will too."
93919,L506472,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I'm going to have to look into this.
93920,L506382,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you."
93921,L506381,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,So we understand each other?
93922,L506380,u2762,m180,PADEN,I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
93923,L506379,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
93924,L506378,u2762,m180,PADEN,What is it you want from me?
93925,L506377,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us."
93926,L506376,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Well, thanks, but forget it."
93927,L506375,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Easy, boy. Just an idea."
93928,L506373,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Maybe you could run it without Stella.
93929,L506372,u2762,m180,PADEN,It is that.
93930,L506371,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I told you this was a sweet set-up.
93931,L506370,u2762,m180,PADEN,This is a lot of money.
93932,L506369,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I took out thirteen dollars.
93933,L506235,u2762,m180,PADEN,Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
93934,L506234,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Nothing like that will happen between us.
93935,L506206,u2762,m180,PADEN,You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
93936,L506205,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
93937,L506204,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Luck, I guess."
93938,L506203,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,What brings you into my saloon?
93939,L506201,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?"
93940,L506200,u2762,m180,PADEN,I just got to town.
93941,L506199,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,You got a place to stay?
93942,L505861,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine."
93943,L505860,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world."
93944,L505859,u2762,m180,PADEN,You're right.
93945,L505858,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it."
93946,L505857,u2762,m180,PADEN,You've got a legitimate job.
93947,L505856,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
93948,L505855,u2762,m180,PADEN,I've given that up.
93949,L505854,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
93950,L505853,u2762,m180,PADEN,Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
93951,L505852,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,Where's the dog?
93952,L505851,u2762,m180,PADEN,It's been a while.
93953,L505850,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I see you're prospering without me.
93954,L505845,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Hello, Paden. How ya doing?"
93955,L505844,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Hello, Cobb."
93956,L506513,u2762,m180,PADEN,You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
93957,L506512,u2766,m180,STELLA,I've got a place I can hide her.
93958,L506506,u2766,m180,STELLA,He can't hurt me if he's dead.
93959,L506505,u2762,m180,PADEN,I don't want you to get hurt.
93960,L506504,u2766,m180,STELLA,How about you?
93961,L506503,u2766,m180,STELLA,I'm ready for that.
93962,L506502,u2762,m180,PADEN,I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
93963,L506501,u2766,m180,STELLA,Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
93964,L506494,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time."
93965,L506493,u2766,m180,STELLA,"Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about."
93966,L506492,u2762,m180,PADEN,You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
93967,L506491,u2766,m180,STELLA,If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
93968,L506490,u2762,m180,PADEN,What makes you say that?
93969,L506489,u2766,m180,STELLA,"Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good."
93970,L506488,u2762,m180,PADEN,What do you mean?
93971,L506487,u2766,m180,STELLA,What is it that I can't figure?
93972,L506367,u2762,m180,PADEN,He left me.
93973,L506366,u2766,m180,STELLA,Where's the dog now?
93974,L506278,u2762,m180,PADEN,Give me some of the good stuff.
93975,L506277,u2766,m180,STELLA,You really are a gambler.
93976,L506256,u2762,m180,PADEN,"Oh, yeah? How good?"
93977,L506255,u2766,m180,STELLA,That's the good stuff.
93978,L506254,u2762,m180,PADEN,What's this?
93979,L506253,u2762,m180,PADEN,"I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey."
93980,L506252,u2766,m180,STELLA,I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
93981,L506251,u2762,m180,PADEN,Is this a fair mix?
93982,L506191,u2766,m180,STELLA,Here he comes right now.
93983,L506190,u2762,m180,PADEN,Who's the owner?
93984,L506189,u2766,m180,STELLA,I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
93985,L506188,u2762,m180,PADEN,Why'd you go into business with him?
93986,L506187,u2766,m180,STELLA,"Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked."
93987,L506186,u2762,m180,PADEN,So-called?
93988,L506185,u2766,m180,STELLA,"That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side."
93989,L506184,u2766,m180,STELLA,You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
93990,L506183,u2762,m180,PADEN,"You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?"
93991,L506182,u2766,m180,STELLA,Me too. What's wrong with us?
93992,L506181,u2762,m180,PADEN,It's the only place I'm happy.
93993,L506180,u2766,m180,STELLA,You like a good saloon?
93994,L506179,u2762,m180,PADEN,And I know what I'm talking about.
93995,L506178,u2766,m180,STELLA,Thanks. That's what I call it too.
93996,L506177,u2762,m180,PADEN,"My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon."
93997,L506176,u2766,m180,STELLA,"I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night."
93998,L506175,u2762,m180,PADEN,Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
93999,L506174,u2762,m180,PADEN,Paden.
94000,L506173,u2766,m180,STELLA,Stella.
94001,L506172,u2762,m180,PADEN,"I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --"
94002,L506171,u2766,m180,STELLA,"The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations."
94003,L506170,u2762,m180,PADEN,Nifty.
94004,L506168,u2766,m180,STELLA,I run the place. What can I get you?
94005,L506167,u2762,m180,PADEN,You work here?
94006,L506360,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be."
94007,L506359,u2766,m180,STELLA,"From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money."
94008,L506358,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,I thought you two would get along.
94009,L506357,u2766,m180,STELLA,I wouldn't worry about that.
94010,L506356,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
94011,L506195,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common."
94012,L506194,u2766,m180,STELLA,That was my plan.
94013,L506193,u2765,m180,SHERIFF COBB,"Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right."
94014,L507931,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
94015,L507930,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
94016,L507929,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I am telling the truth.
94017,L507928,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,"Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards."
94018,L507927,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
94019,L507926,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
94020,L507919,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Who?
94021,L507918,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,"But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith."
94022,L507917,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,"And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the ""man"" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?"
94023,L507916,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Of course.
94024,L507915,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,"So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone."
94025,L507914,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros."
94026,L507913,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
94027,L507912,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder."
94028,L507911,u2767,m181,DETECTIVE,"-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake."
94029,L507780,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,Good-bye.
94030,L507779,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I'm glad we talked.
94031,L507778,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --"
94032,L507777,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Okay -- for you.
94033,L507776,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me."
94034,L507775,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday."
94035,L507774,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera."
94036,L507773,u2768,m181,ELAINE,We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
94037,L507772,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
94038,L507771,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
94039,L507770,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different."
94040,L507769,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"My God, are you alright, Simone?"
94041,L507768,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,I'm not --  He's not.
94042,L507767,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world."
94043,L507766,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I."
94044,L507765,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
94045,L507764,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
94046,L507763,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once."
94047,L507762,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
94048,L507974,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,No... it's life.
94049,L507973,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence."
94050,L507969,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?"
94051,L507968,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"I was thinking -- what about you and... ""Simone"" moving back in with me and Lainey?"
94052,L507967,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things."
94053,L507966,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
94054,L507965,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?"
94055,L507964,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
94056,L507907,u2768,m181,ELAINE,How can you bring that up at a time like this?
94057,L507906,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
94058,L507879,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!"
94059,L507878,u2768,m181,ELAINE,You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
94060,L507877,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you."
94061,L507876,u2768,m181,ELAINE,How much wine have you had?
94062,L507875,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --"
94063,L507874,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back."
94064,L507873,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --"
94065,L507872,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles."
94066,L507871,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her."
94067,L507870,u2768,m181,ELAINE,You?
94068,L507869,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Not if I don't let her.
94069,L507868,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
94070,L507867,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again."
94071,L507866,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen."
94072,L507865,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally."
94073,L507864,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?"
94074,L507863,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her."
94075,L507862,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her."
94076,L507861,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
94077,L507860,u2768,m181,ELAINE,This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
94078,L507859,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"I want you back too, Viktor."
94079,L507858,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine."
94080,L507857,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --"
94081,L507856,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
94082,L507855,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I just read somewhere --
94083,L507854,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Impossible.
94084,L507853,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?"
94085,L507852,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Not quite.
94086,L507851,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Is Simone back to earth yet?
94087,L507850,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives."
94088,L507849,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,About now.  Would you like a drink?
94089,L507848,u2768,m181,ELAINE,When is she coming over?
94090,L507847,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,As a matter-of-fact I am.
94091,L507846,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
94092,L507845,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Elaine, it's Wednesday."
94093,L507729,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I can imagine.
94094,L507728,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
94095,L507727,u2768,m181,ELAINE,... Simone.
94096,L507726,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
94097,L507725,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,My two favorite girls.
94098,L507660,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor."
94099,L507659,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Excuse me?  Start?
94100,L507658,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start."
94101,L507657,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I do?
94102,L507656,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit."
94103,L507655,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Do what?
94104,L507654,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Viktor, do you realize you always do that?"
94105,L507653,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Thank you.
94106,L507652,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular."
94107,L507651,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?"
94108,L507650,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
94109,L507649,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,No.
94110,L507648,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?"
94111,L507603,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?"
94112,L507602,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
94113,L507601,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?"
94114,L507600,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Really?
94115,L507599,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She said you were very beautiful.
94116,L507598,u2768,m181,ELAINE,She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
94117,L507592,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
94118,L507591,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor."
94119,L507590,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
94120,L507589,u2768,m181,ELAINE,You're so good to protect her like this.
94121,L507588,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She doesn't want pity.
94122,L507587,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Viktor, you should have said something."
94123,L507586,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
94124,L507580,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public..."
94125,L507579,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- I can explain.
94126,L507578,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"So, the secret's finally out, Viktor."
94127,L507573,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of ""Good For Nothing"".  It's not a good time."
94128,L507572,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will."
94129,L507561,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!"
94130,L507560,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- You can't go in there!
94131,L507502,u2768,m181,ELAINE,That's true.
94132,L507501,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Everyone you know is lying.
94133,L507500,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Everyone I know has met her, Viktor."
94134,L507499,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Soon.  Soon.
94135,L507498,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
94136,L507497,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
94137,L507496,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something."
94138,L507495,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You really think so?
94139,L507494,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
94140,L507493,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Better late than never.
94141,L507492,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
94142,L507486,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
94143,L507485,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?"
94144,L507484,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
94145,L507479,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?"
94146,L507478,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up."
94147,L507380,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust."
94148,L507379,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Simone does not control my destiny.
94149,L507378,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny."
94150,L507377,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?"
94151,L507376,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it."
94152,L507375,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I'll walk you out.
94153,L507374,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
94154,L507373,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
94155,L507372,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune."
94156,L507371,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Well, shoot it on the last day."
94157,L507370,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Even the fall from the plane.
94158,L507369,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Even the fall from the plane?
94159,L507368,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,No need.  She does all her own stunts.
94160,L507367,u2768,m181,ELAINE,There isn't one.
94161,L507366,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,What about it?
94162,L507365,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Well, we have to do something about this -- ""stuntwoman""."
94163,L507364,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
94164,L507363,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
94165,L507362,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I'll send you her resume.
94166,L507361,u2768,m181,ELAINE,She was in the theater?  When? Where?
94167,L507360,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She'll do her own.  Theater training.
94168,L507359,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Hair and make-up?
94169,L507358,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She'll drive herself.
94170,L507357,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service."
94171,L507356,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,If it's on the page...
94172,L507355,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?"
94173,L507354,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... ""instrument""."
94174,L507353,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
94175,L507352,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"""Forever""."
94176,L507351,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Viktor, we simply have to talk about ""Eternity..."""
94177,L507348,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Why not?
94178,L507347,u2768,m181,ELAINE,No problem.  Do you want to come in?
94179,L507346,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
94180,L507218,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me."
94181,L507217,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Viktor, it's my studio."
94182,L507216,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Out of the question.  A circus like that?
94183,L507215,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
94184,L507214,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art."
94185,L507213,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Why not?
94186,L507212,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I don't know if that's going to happen.
94187,L507211,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I can't wait to meet her.
94188,L507210,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Almost right.
94189,L507209,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  ""Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel""."
94190,L507208,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
94191,L507207,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
94192,L507205,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
94193,L507204,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Why isn't she with you?
94194,L507203,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Good to see you too, Elaine."
94195,L507202,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Where is she?
94196,L507085,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor."
94197,L507084,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady."
94198,L507083,u2768,m181,ELAINE,They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
94199,L507082,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?"
94200,L507081,u2768,m181,ELAINE,The picture's dead.
94201,L507080,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture."
94202,L507079,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?"
94203,L507077,u2768,m181,ELAINE,How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
94204,L507076,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You're not renewing my contract.
94205,L507075,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over."
94206,L507074,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Spare me.
94207,L507073,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business."
94208,L507072,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
94209,L507071,u2768,m181,ELAINE,-- It's called a projector.
94210,L507070,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --"
94211,L507069,u2768,m181,ELAINE,You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
94212,L507068,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!"
94213,L507067,u2768,m181,ELAINE,It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
94214,L507066,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Please.
94215,L507065,u2768,m181,ELAINE,The public decides who's on that list.
94216,L507064,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list."
94217,L507063,u2768,m181,ELAINE,-- What's wrong with that?
94218,L507062,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class."
94219,L507061,u2768,m181,ELAINE,-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
94220,L507060,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?"
94221,L507059,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"-- Viktor, that was Short Subject."
94222,L507058,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --"
94223,L507057,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
94224,L507056,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?"
94225,L507055,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Difficult.  I'm difficult.
94226,L507054,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?"
94227,L507053,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Excuse us.
94228,L507052,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
94229,L507049,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
94230,L507048,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
94231,L507761,u2782,m181,SIMONE,Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
94232,L507760,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Where are you?
94233,L507759,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you."
94234,L507758,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you."
94235,L507757,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"Hello, is this Elaine?"
94236,L507756,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Hello?
94237,L507951,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?"
94238,L507950,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real."
94239,L507949,u2775,m181,LAINEY,-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
94240,L507948,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Well, I --"
94241,L507947,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?"
94242,L507946,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
94243,L507945,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Of course.  What are you suggesting?
94244,L507944,u2775,m181,LAINEY,So you did meet her?
94245,L507943,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met."
94246,L507942,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Because obviously she existed, right?"
94247,L507941,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that."
94248,L507940,u2775,m181,LAINEY,Just a minute.
94249,L507939,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here."
94250,L507731,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"It was a great show, Dad..."
94251,L507730,u2768,m181,ELAINE,Thank Simone for the tickets.
94252,L507662,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight."
94253,L507661,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Mom, do you miss Dad?"
94254,L507737,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I have to talk to her.
94255,L507736,u2774,m181,KENT,"Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?"
94256,L507735,u2768,m181,ELAINE,"Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him."
94257,L507734,u2774,m181,KENT,Why?
94258,L507733,u2768,m181,ELAINE,I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
94259,L507097,u2768,m181,ELAINE,He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
94260,L507096,u2774,m181,KENT,"You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability."
94261,L507477,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Please put your clothes on
94262,L507476,u2769,m181,FAITH,"""Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here""."
94263,L507475,u2769,m181,FAITH,Is that a problem?
94264,L507474,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You're with me to be close to her?
94265,L507473,u2769,m181,FAITH,"Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night."
94266,L507472,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Simone?
94267,L507471,u2769,m181,FAITH,"Yes, call me Simone."
94268,L507470,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,What I do to Simone?
94269,L507469,u2769,m181,FAITH,Do what you do to Simone.
94270,L507468,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,What?... What did you say?
94271,L507465,u2769,m181,FAITH,"I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky."
94272,L507464,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right."
94273,L507463,u2769,m181,FAITH,... so much like her?
94274,L507462,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You look so, so..."
94275,L507461,u2769,m181,FAITH,Of course.
94276,L507460,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent."
94277,L507459,u2769,m181,FAITH,"No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?"
94278,L507458,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals."
94279,L507980,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,And what may I ask brought this on?
94280,L507979,u2782,m181,SIMONE,That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
94281,L507978,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
94282,L507977,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much."
94283,L507976,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media..."
94284,L507975,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,"-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... ""why?"""
94285,L507642,u2782,m181,SIMONE,I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
94286,L507641,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
94287,L507640,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option."
94288,L507639,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,How about the nudity?
94289,L507638,u2782,m181,SIMONE,Sure.  Where would you like to start?
94290,L507637,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
94291,L507636,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"No, I'm okay."
94292,L507627,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, ""Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."""
94293,L507626,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,Who are you really?
94294,L507625,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people."
94295,L507624,u2782,m181,SIMONE,I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
94296,L507623,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,You don't secretly want the attention?
94297,L507622,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film."
94298,L507621,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,"Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more."
94299,L507620,u2782,m181,SIMONE,I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
94300,L507619,u2770,m181,FRANK BRAND,"Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?"
94301,L507530,u2771,m181,HAL,Simone!
94302,L507529,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist."
94303,L507527,u2771,m181,HAL,I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
94304,L507526,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I know what you mean.
94305,L507525,u2771,m181,HAL,You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
94306,L507520,u2771,m181,HAL,Somebody said she was here.
94307,L507519,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?"
94308,L507518,u2771,m181,HAL,Is she here?
94309,L507429,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on."
94310,L507428,u2771,m181,HAL,How did the wall get there?
94311,L507427,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
94312,L507426,u2771,m181,HAL,"-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --"
94313,L507425,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,There's... a wall between you --
94314,L507424,u2771,m181,HAL,Why not?
94315,L507423,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You can't.
94316,L507422,u2771,m181,HAL,But she's right there!  I must feel her!
94317,L507421,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Absolutely not!
94318,L507420,u2771,m181,HAL,"Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!"
94319,L507419,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Hal, what are you doing?"
94320,L507388,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now."
94321,L507387,u2771,m181,HAL,For her?
94322,L507386,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Body double.
94323,L507385,u2771,m181,HAL,How will you do our love scenes?
94324,L507303,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for ""Eternity Forever""?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it."
94325,L507302,u2771,m181,HAL,It was more in passing.
94326,L507301,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
94327,L507299,u2771,m181,HAL,"I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it."
94328,L507298,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Really?  She didn't mention it.
94329,L507297,u2771,m181,HAL,"Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day."
94330,L507296,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Clyde.
94331,L507295,u2771,m181,HAL,"And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read ""Eternity Forever"" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive."
94332,L507294,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You never were together, Hal."
94333,L507293,u2771,m181,HAL,The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
94334,L507292,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Hello, Hal."
94335,L507291,u2771,m181,HAL,"Viktor, I'm so happy for us!"
94336,L507047,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture."
94337,L507046,u2771,m181,HAL,Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
94338,L507135,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I'm already dead.
94339,L507134,u2772,m181,HANK,I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
94340,L507133,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week."
94341,L507132,u2772,m181,HANK,"I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage."
94342,L507131,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You saw that?
94343,L507130,u2772,m181,HANK,"""Straw God"" changed my life."
94344,L507129,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You do?
94345,L507128,u2772,m181,HANK,An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
94346,L507127,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,What's that?
94347,L507126,u2772,m181,HANK,That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
94348,L507125,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I don't know anything about computers.
94349,L507124,u2772,m181,HANK,"It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together."
94350,L507123,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done."
94351,L507122,u2772,m181,HANK,"You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years."
94352,L507121,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake."
94353,L507120,u2772,m181,HANK,-- Flesh is weak.
94354,L507119,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I need flesh and --
94355,L507118,u2772,m181,HANK,"-- We call them ""vactors""."
94356,L507117,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?"
94357,L507116,u2772,m181,HANK,Not like this --
94358,L507115,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I've seen them all before.
94359,L507114,u2772,m181,HANK,You have to see her.
94360,L507113,u2772,m181,HANK,Don't be.  It was worth it.
94361,L507112,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I'm sorry.
94362,L507111,u2772,m181,HANK,Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
94363,L507110,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Good for you, Hank."
94364,L507109,u2772,m181,HANK,"-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer."
94365,L507108,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
94366,L507107,u2772,m181,HANK,"It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... ""Who Needs Humans?"""
94367,L507106,u2772,m181,HANK,I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
94368,L507105,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I was misquoted.
94369,L507104,u2772,m181,HANK,"I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this."
94370,L507103,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You want me to call Security?
94371,L507102,u2772,m181,HANK,"I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her."
94372,L507101,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- Please, get away from me."
94373,L507100,u2772,m181,HANK,"-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --"
94374,L507515,u2773,m181,HARRY,I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
94375,L507514,u2780,m181,PREMIERE REPORTER 2,Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
94376,L507513,u2773,m181,HARRY,"We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private."
94377,L507512,u2780,m181,PREMIERE REPORTER 2,"There's a rumor that you're more than just ""good friends""?"
94378,L507511,u2773,m181,HARRY,"I just came out to support my good friend, Simone."
94379,L507510,u2780,m181,PREMIERE REPORTER 2,Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
94380,L507972,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it."
94381,L507971,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Me and Simone.  What I did.
94382,L507970,u2775,m181,LAINEY,About you and mom?
94383,L507820,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Lainey...
94384,L507819,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad."
94385,L507818,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No, that was me."
94386,L507817,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you."
94387,L507816,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
94388,L507815,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad."
94389,L507814,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
94390,L507813,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I know.  Thank her for me.
94391,L507812,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"It's the car she drove in ""Eternity Forever""."
94392,L507811,u2775,m181,LAINEY,It's fantastic -- it's too much.
94393,L507810,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?"
94394,L507789,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She did... didn't she?
94395,L507788,u2775,m181,LAINEY,Why didn't she thank you?
94396,L507754,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"I love you too, daddy."
94397,L507753,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I love you, Lainey."
94398,L507751,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
94399,L507750,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?"
94400,L507749,u2775,m181,LAINEY,Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
94401,L507748,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
94402,L507747,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe."
94403,L507746,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship."
94404,L507745,u2775,m181,LAINEY,She thinks you're with Simone.
94405,L507744,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Really?  Too bad.
94406,L507743,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent."
94407,L507742,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I noticed.
94408,L507741,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You know me -- married to my work.
94409,L507740,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I do okay.  How about you?
94410,L507739,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?"
94411,L507490,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Night, Lainey."
94412,L507489,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Good-night, Daddy."
94413,L507488,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Precisely.
94414,L507487,u2775,m181,LAINEY,So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
94415,L507482,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?"
94416,L507481,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I know, Hal is as stiff as always."
94417,L507480,u2775,m181,LAINEY,One thing bothered me.
94418,L507345,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
94419,L507344,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
94420,L507343,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"-- I know, I don't know anything."
94421,L507342,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,If anyone asks about Simone --
94422,L507341,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Okay, Dad."
94423,L507327,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
94424,L507326,u2775,m181,LAINEY,You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
94425,L507325,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
94426,L507324,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I read.
94427,L507323,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,How?
94428,L507322,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I do.
94429,L507321,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
94430,L507320,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away."
94431,L507319,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
94432,L507318,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I know plenty of boys.
94433,L507317,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
94434,L507316,u2775,m181,LAINEY,Why?
94435,L507315,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Can't you stop that?
94436,L507185,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off."
94437,L507184,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?"
94438,L507183,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?"
94439,L507162,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She can't watch herself.
94440,L507161,u2775,m181,LAINEY,Is she here tonight?
94441,L507160,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You know, I... don't know."
94442,L507159,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?"
94443,L507158,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Me too.
94444,L507157,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
94445,L507156,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,There was no other way.
94446,L507155,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?"
94447,L507154,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Not quite how I imagined it --
94448,L507153,u2775,m181,LAINEY,This week anyhow.
94449,L507152,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She still with Kent?
94450,L507151,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"She's at the premiere of ""A Cold Day In Hell"".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions."
94451,L507150,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Your mother couldn't make it?
94452,L507149,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Hello, Lainey."
94453,L507148,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Hi, Dad."
94454,L507094,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky."
94455,L507093,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important."
94456,L507091,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
94457,L507090,u2775,m181,LAINEY,Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
94458,L507089,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --"
94459,L507088,u2775,m181,LAINEY,I'm sorry Mom canned you.
94460,L507087,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Hello, sweetheart."
94461,L507086,u2775,m181,LAINEY,"Hi, Dad."
94462,L507957,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
94463,L507956,u2776,m181,LAWYER,What?!
94464,L507955,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
94465,L507938,u2776,m181,LAWYER,An insanity defence.
94466,L507937,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!"
94467,L507936,u2776,m181,LAWYER,"You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake."
94468,L507935,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I could get the death penalty.
94469,L507934,u2776,m181,LAWYER,-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
94470,L507809,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,This should take care of Mother.
94471,L507808,u2777,m181,MAX,Don't you?
94472,L507807,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You love her, don't you, Max?"
94473,L507806,u2777,m181,MAX,No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
94474,L507805,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
94475,L507804,u2777,m181,MAX,I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
94476,L507803,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me."
94477,L507802,u2777,m181,MAX,That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
94478,L507798,u2777,m181,MAX,She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
94479,L507797,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,She looks a lot like you.
94480,L507796,u2777,m181,MAX,I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
94481,L507795,u2777,m181,MAX,"Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks..."
94482,L507794,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"What now, Sayer?"
94483,L507699,u2777,m181,MAX,"Er,... good."
94484,L507698,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal."
94485,L507697,u2777,m181,MAX,I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
94486,L507696,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"What is it exactly you want, Sayer?"
94487,L507695,u2777,m181,MAX,I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
94488,L507694,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Abduction?
94489,L507693,u2777,m181,MAX,I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
94490,L507692,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I'm keeping it in trust.
94491,L507691,u2777,m181,MAX,"-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have ""obtained"" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her."
94492,L507690,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- I bet you have.
94493,L507689,u2777,m181,MAX,I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
94494,L507688,u2777,m181,MAX,She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
94495,L507687,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,The background is.
94496,L507686,u2777,m181,MAX,It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
94497,L507684,u2777,m181,MAX,I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
94498,L507683,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I don't have time for this, Sayer."
94499,L507682,u2777,m181,MAX,I know what you're up to.
94500,L507681,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,It's a yacht.
94501,L507680,u2777,m181,MAX,"Nice boat, Taransky."
94502,L507338,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me."
94503,L507337,u2777,m181,MAX,"Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted."
94504,L507336,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night."
94505,L507335,u2777,m181,MAX,"The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural."
94506,L507334,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of ""captive"" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops."
94507,L507333,u2777,m181,MAX,"She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?"
94508,L507241,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up."
94509,L507240,u2777,m181,MAX,"So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill."
94510,L507239,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"They are alive, Sayer."
94511,L507238,u2777,m181,MAX,"Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me."
94512,L507237,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
94513,L507236,u2777,m181,MAX,This is the story.
94514,L507235,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
94515,L507234,u2777,m181,MAX,Max Sayer -- National Echo.
94516,L507233,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Do I know you?
94517,L507670,u2778,m181,MILTON,Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
94518,L507669,u2777,m181,MAX,I don't understand.
94519,L507668,u2778,m181,MILTON,It's a hotel.
94520,L507666,u2778,m181,MILTON,Is that why she left you?
94521,L507665,u2777,m181,MAX,-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
94522,L507609,u2778,m181,MILTON,We used to.
94523,L507608,u2777,m181,MAX,"-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence."
94524,L507607,u2778,m181,MILTON,"Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?"
94525,L507606,u2777,m181,MAX,What do you want -- ?
94526,L507605,u2778,m181,MILTON,Mr. Sayer...
94527,L507559,u2777,m181,MAX,"Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can."
94528,L507558,u2778,m181,MILTON,Long live the First Amendment.
94529,L507557,u2777,m181,MAX,"Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it."
94530,L507556,u2777,m181,MAX,I will when you're finished writing it.
94531,L507555,u2778,m181,MILTON,"My God, you've got one?"
94532,L507554,u2777,m181,MAX,"Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood."
94533,L507553,u2777,m181,MAX,"Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past."
94534,L507552,u2778,m181,MILTON,"Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers."
94535,L507551,u2777,m181,MAX,"Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?"
94536,L507550,u2778,m181,MILTON,"Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good."
94537,L507549,u2777,m181,MAX,24-hour tail on Taransky?
94538,L507548,u2778,m181,MILTON,"We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer."
94539,L507313,u2777,m181,MAX,"Yes, very."
94540,L507312,u2778,m181,MILTON,Dark?
94541,L507311,u2777,m181,MAX,"Whatever it is, it's dark."
94542,L507310,u2778,m181,MILTON,Why?
94543,L507309,u2777,m181,MAX,"Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption."
94544,L507308,u2778,m181,MILTON,Maybe he's talking to himself.
94545,L507307,u2777,m181,MAX,Is it a jamming device?
94546,L507837,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy."
94547,L507836,u2779,m181,NICOLA,You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
94548,L507835,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone."
94549,L507834,u2779,m181,NICOLA,But that's Simone's part.
94550,L507833,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You could play the lead.
94551,L507832,u2779,m181,NICOLA,Thank you.
94552,L507831,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good."
94553,L507829,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Yes, I'd like that."
94554,L507828,u2779,m181,NICOLA,Would you like me to read?
94555,L507827,u2779,m181,NICOLA,"After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me."
94556,L507826,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Thank you.  It's not important.
94557,L507825,u2779,m181,NICOLA,"I never apologized properly for what happened on ""Sunrise""."
94558,L507824,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Yes.
94559,L507823,u2779,m181,NICOLA,A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
94560,L507030,u2779,m181,NICOLA,"It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing ""creative differences""."
94561,L507029,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
94562,L507028,u2779,m181,NICOLA,I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
94563,L507027,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
94564,L507023,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Taller?  What?
94565,L507022,u2779,m181,NICOLA,"Taller, Viktor."
94566,L507021,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
94567,L507020,u2779,m181,NICOLA,"It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?"
94568,L507019,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --"
94569,L507018,u2779,m181,NICOLA,You're in breach.
94570,L507017,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
94571,L507248,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
94572,L507247,u2781,m181,SECURITY GUARD,What if it catches on fire?
94573,L507246,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission."
94574,L507245,u2781,m181,SECURITY GUARD,Is Miss Simone coming today?
94575,L507244,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Good.
94576,L507243,u2781,m181,SECURITY GUARD,"No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky."
94577,L507434,u2782,m181,SIMONE,-- What you don't understand --
94578,L507433,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Let's take it down a notch.
94579,L507390,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"I certainly am, Mr. Taransky."
94580,L507389,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Simone, are you there?"
94581,L507284,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky."
94582,L507283,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?"
94583,L507282,u2782,m181,SIMONE,"I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky."
94584,L507269,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you."
94585,L507268,u2782,m181,SIMONE,Hi.
94586,L507442,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us."
94587,L507441,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky."
94588,L507281,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,I was hoping you'd say that.
94589,L507280,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Not, ""Eternity Forever""?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part."
94590,L507279,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
94591,L507278,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture."
94592,L507277,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,You know what I'm talking about.
94593,L507276,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,The only real truth is in the work.
94594,L507275,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?"
94595,L507274,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area."
94596,L507273,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see."
94597,L507272,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros."
94598,L507271,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
94599,L507270,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,You did create me.
94600,L507264,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Yes.  Yes, it is."
94601,L507263,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Is that better, Mr. Taransky?"
94602,L507261,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
94603,L507260,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
94604,L507259,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,I am the death of real.
94605,L507258,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it."
94606,L507257,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,Maybe he can.
94607,L507255,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
94608,L507254,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,You mean they buy it?
94609,L507253,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,... digitized.
94610,L507252,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,A star is...
94611,L507251,u2783,m181,SIMONE / VIKTOR,"Good morning, Mr. Taransky."
94612,L507250,u2784,m181,VIKTOR,"Good morning, Simone."
94613,L509797,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Goodnight, sweetheart."
94614,L509796,u2785,m182,ANNA,"Goodnight, Malcolm."
94615,L509793,u2785,m182,ANNA,Tell me.
94616,L509792,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
94617,L509786,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I didn't leave you.
94618,L509785,u2785,m182,ANNA,Why did you leave me?
94619,L509784,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?"
94620,L509783,u2785,m182,ANNA,"Why, Malcolm?"
94621,L509324,u2785,m182,ANNA,What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
94622,L509323,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Are you calling me?
94623,L509136,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,--Do I know you?
94624,L509135,u2785,m182,ANNA,--My God.
94625,L509111,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,We can keep it in the bathroom.
94626,L509110,u2785,m182,ANNA,Wow. They called you their son.
94627,L509108,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
94628,L509107,u2785,m182,ANNA,"Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor."
94629,L509106,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
94630,L509105,u2785,m182,ANNA,Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
94631,L509333,u2790,m182,MAN'S VOICE,Thanks.
94632,L509332,u2785,m182,ANNA,Don't step in the horse manure.
94633,L509331,u2790,m182,MAN'S VOICE,Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
94634,L509330,u2785,m182,ANNA,You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
94635,L509329,u2790,m182,MAN'S VOICE,Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
94636,L509328,u2785,m182,ANNA,That's very sweet. I'm okay.
94637,L509326,u2785,m182,ANNA,"I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them."
94638,L509325,u2790,m182,MAN'S VOICE,On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
94639,L509723,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
94640,L509722,u2786,m182,COLE,What?
94641,L509721,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,And you know what else?
94642,L509720,u2786,m182,COLE,Really?
94643,L509719,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"You were great in the play, Cole."
94644,L509717,u2786,m182,COLE,Maybe.
94645,L509716,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
94646,L509679,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I definitely won't.
94647,L509678,u2786,m182,COLE,"Don't go home, okay?"
94648,L509677,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Where will you go, where no one has died?"
94649,L509676,u2786,m182,COLE,I wish I were somewhere else.
94650,L509669,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I guess she did.
94651,L509668,u2786,m182,COLE,"She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?"
94652,L509654,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"I don't think that's the way it works, Cole."
94653,L509653,u2786,m182,COLE,What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
94654,L509651,u2786,m182,COLE,You do?
94655,L509650,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
94656,L509649,u2786,m182,COLE,You believe now?
94657,L509648,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
94658,L509647,u2786,m182,COLE,Just help.
94659,L509646,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole..."
94660,L509645,u2786,m182,COLE,No.
94661,L509644,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?"
94662,L509643,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
94663,L509642,u2786,m182,COLE,You have nice red in your cheeks now.
94664,L509641,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone..."
94665,L509640,u2786,m182,COLE,You really look better.
94666,L509638,u2786,m182,COLE,What happened?
94667,L509637,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"No, we're not."
94668,L509636,u2786,m182,COLE,"We're not gonna start crying again, are we?"
94669,L509635,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Yes, I am."
94670,L509634,u2786,m182,COLE,Are you wigging out?
94671,L509633,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Yes, it did."
94672,L509632,u2786,m182,COLE,"Something happened, didn't it?"
94673,L509604,u2786,m182,COLE,"You believe me, right?"
94674,L509603,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Yes.
94675,L509602,u2786,m182,COLE,Dr. Crowe?
94676,L509601,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
94677,L509600,u2786,m182,COLE,You weren't a paper champion.
94678,L509599,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
94679,L509598,u2786,m182,COLE,Don't cry.
94680,L509596,u2786,m182,COLE,Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
94681,L509595,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,--What?
94682,L509594,u2786,m182,COLE,Don't fail me.
94683,L509593,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
94684,L509592,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Soon. One week.
94685,L509591,u2786,m182,COLE,When?
94686,L509590,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I have to.
94687,L509585,u2786,m182,COLE,Why don't you think about it for a while?
94688,L509584,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"I don't know, Cole."
94689,L509583,u2786,m182,COLE,I told you what I want.
94690,L509582,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I don't know.
94691,L509581,u2786,m182,COLE,What do you want more than anything?
94692,L509580,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Yes.
94693,L509579,u2786,m182,COLE,Can I ask you then?
94694,L509510,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Them?
94695,L509509,u2786,m182,COLE,"When they get mad, it gets cold."
94696,L509507,u2786,m182,COLE,And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
94697,L509506,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Yes?
94698,L509497,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Never mind.
94699,L509496,u2786,m182,COLE,Cats?
94700,L509495,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats."
94701,L509494,u2786,m182,COLE,Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
94702,L509493,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,What?
94703,L509492,u2786,m182,COLE,Did you think the play sucked big time?
94704,L509479,u2786,m182,COLE,Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
94705,L509478,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,...No.
94706,L509477,u2786,m182,COLE,"All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?"
94707,L509476,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,How often do you see them?
94708,L509473,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,They don't know they're dead?
94709,L509472,u2786,m182,COLE,"No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead."
94710,L509471,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Dead people, like in graves and coffins?"
94711,L509464,u2786,m182,COLE,Me too.
94712,L509463,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
94713,L509459,u2786,m182,COLE,Your eyes told me.
94714,L509458,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,What makes you think that?
94715,L509455,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"No gas... Hey, that's good."
94716,L509454,u2786,m182,COLE,You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
94717,L509453,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,No.
94718,L509452,u2786,m182,COLE,You haven't told bedtime stories before?
94719,L509451,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Yes.
94720,L509450,u2786,m182,COLE,Dr. Crowe.
94721,L509449,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--"
94722,L509448,u2786,m182,COLE,Yes.
94723,L509447,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
94724,L509380,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I forgot myself.
94725,L509379,u2786,m182,COLE,I didn't know you were funny.
94726,L509378,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Who me?
94727,L509377,u2786,m182,COLE,You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
94728,L509376,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,What?
94729,L509375,u2786,m182,COLE,That isn't magic.
94730,L509319,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?"
94731,L509318,u2786,m182,COLE,Something I want?
94732,L509317,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
94733,L509313,u2786,m182,COLE,Upset words.
94734,L509312,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,What kind of words?
94735,L509311,u2786,m182,COLE,Words.
94736,L509310,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,What'd you write?
94737,L509303,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
94738,L509302,u2786,m182,COLE,What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
94739,L509301,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
94740,L509286,u2786,m182,COLE,She died a long time ago.
94741,L509285,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,What about Mrs. Marschal?
94742,L509284,u2786,m182,COLE,Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
94743,L509273,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Yeah. Sorry.
94744,L509272,u2786,m182,COLE,"You said the ""s"" word."
94745,L509270,u2786,m182,COLE,That I'm a freak.
94746,L509269,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Know what?
94747,L509268,u2786,m182,COLE,Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
94748,L509267,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Why?
94749,L509266,u2786,m182,COLE,I don't tell her a thing.
94750,L509265,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
94751,L509263,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,You hate him?
94752,L509262,u2786,m182,COLE,He hates me.
94753,L509261,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,He your best buddy?
94754,L509260,u2786,m182,COLE,I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
94755,L509255,u2786,m182,COLE,Look over there.
94756,L509254,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Where should I look then, Cole?"
94757,L509250,u2786,m182,COLE,"Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her."
94758,L509249,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,You mean aneurysm.
94759,L509248,u2786,m182,COLE,Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
94760,L509245,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question."
94761,L509244,u2786,m182,COLE,You want to ask me a question?
94762,L509231,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I guess they don't.
94763,L509230,u2786,m182,COLE,"I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows."
94764,L509229,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,How do you draw now?
94765,L509228,u2786,m182,COLE,Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
94766,L509227,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"You saw that on T.V., Cole?"
94767,L509226,u2786,m182,COLE,We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
94768,L509187,u2786,m182,COLE,Next time I won't be scared of you.
94769,L509186,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"And Cole, next time I won't be late for you."
94770,L509184,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,If it's okay with you?
94771,L509183,u2786,m182,COLE,"I'm going to see you again, right?"
94772,L509182,u2786,m182,COLE,That's good.
94773,L509181,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,No.
94774,L509180,u2786,m182,COLE,Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
94775,L509179,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,No.
94776,L509178,u2786,m182,COLE,You use needles?
94777,L509177,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
94778,L509176,u2786,m182,COLE,Congratulations.
94779,L509175,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I got an award once. From the Mayor.
94780,L509173,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
94781,L509172,u2786,m182,COLE,You're a doctor. What kind?
94782,L509171,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Dr. Crowe.
94783,L509170,u2786,m182,COLE,I forgot your name.
94784,L509168,u2786,m182,COLE,"Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?"
94785,L509167,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,"Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them."
94786,L509166,u2786,m182,COLE,What were they hiding from?
94787,L509164,u2786,m182,COLE,"No, just one."
94788,L509163,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,All your soldiers speak Latin?
94789,L509161,u2786,m182,COLE,...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
94790,L509160,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
94791,L509159,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,I knew there was a sound explanation.
94792,L509158,u2786,m182,COLE,They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
94793,L509157,u2789,m182,MALCOLM,Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
94794,L509772,u2786,m182,COLE,"She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance."
94795,L509771,u2788,m182,LYNN,"Cole, please stop."
94796,L509770,u2786,m182,COLE,She wanted me to tell you--
94797,L509769,u2786,m182,COLE,I know.
94798,L509768,u2788,m182,LYNN,"Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that."
94799,L509767,u2786,m182,COLE,Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
94800,L509766,u2788,m182,LYNN,What?
94801,L509765,u2786,m182,COLE,She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
94802,L509762,u2786,m182,COLE,Got it.
94803,L509761,u2788,m182,LYNN,I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
94804,L509759,u2786,m182,COLE,You think I'm a freak?
94805,L509758,u2788,m182,LYNN,...I don't know.
94806,L509757,u2786,m182,COLE,"What are you thinking, Momma?"
94807,L509755,u2788,m182,LYNN,They talk to you?
94808,L509754,u2786,m182,COLE,They want me to do things for them.
94809,L509753,u2788,m182,LYNN,"You see ghosts, Cole?"
94810,L509752,u2786,m182,COLE,Ghosts.
94811,L509751,u2788,m182,LYNN,Dead people?
94812,L509750,u2786,m182,COLE,Dead people.
94813,L509749,u2788,m182,LYNN,They?
94814,L509748,u2786,m182,COLE,They scare me too sometimes.
94815,L509747,u2788,m182,LYNN,"Cole, you're scaring me."
94816,L509745,u2786,m182,COLE,Standing next to my window.
94817,L509744,u2788,m182,LYNN,Where is she?
94818,L509743,u2786,m182,COLE,Yes.
94819,L509742,u2788,m182,LYNN,You can see her?
94820,L509741,u2788,m182,LYNN,Oh my God.
94821,L509740,u2786,m182,COLE,A lady. She died.
94822,L509739,u2788,m182,LYNN,They did?
94823,L509738,u2786,m182,COLE,Someone got hurt.
94824,L509737,u2788,m182,LYNN,Yeah.
94825,L509736,u2786,m182,COLE,You know that accident up there?
94826,L509734,u2786,m182,COLE,Tell you my secrets.
94827,L509733,u2788,m182,LYNN,Communicate?
94828,L509732,u2786,m182,COLE,I'm ready to communicate with you now.
94829,L509731,u2788,m182,LYNN,I'd give anything to have been there.
94830,L509536,u2786,m182,COLE,Maybe.
94831,L509535,u2788,m182,LYNN,"There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?"
94832,L509534,u2788,m182,LYNN,So who moved it?
94833,L509533,u2786,m182,COLE,Don't get mad.
94834,L509532,u2788,m182,LYNN,"You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?"
94835,L509531,u2788,m182,LYNN,Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
94836,L509530,u2786,m182,COLE,Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
94837,L509529,u2788,m182,LYNN,"That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?"
94838,L509528,u2786,m182,COLE,You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
94839,L509527,u2788,m182,LYNN,It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
94840,L509199,u2786,m182,COLE,Anything bad about me?
94841,L509198,u2788,m182,LYNN,Lots of things.
94842,L509197,u2786,m182,COLE,"What are you thinking, Momma?"
94843,L509196,u2786,m182,COLE,Oh.
94844,L509195,u2788,m182,LYNN,They're right here.
94845,L509365,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
94846,L509364,u2786,m182,COLE,Stuttering--

94848,L509362,u2786,m182,COLE,Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!

94850,L509360,u2786,m182,COLE,Stuttering Stanley!
94851,L509359,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,Who!
94852,L509358,u2786,m182,COLE,Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
94853,L509356,u2786,m182,COLE,Stop looking at me.
94854,L509355,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,How did you--?
94855,L509354,u2786,m182,COLE,You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
94856,L509353,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,What--
94857,L509352,u2786,m182,COLE,You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
94858,L509351,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,Excuse me?
94859,L509350,u2786,m182,COLE,You're a stuttering Stanley!

94863,L509346,u2786,m182,COLE,I don't like people looking at me like that.
94864,L509344,u2786,m182,COLE,They were the ones who hanged everybody.
94865,L509343,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,"Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers."
94866,L509342,u2786,m182,COLE,They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
94867,L509341,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
94868,L509340,u2786,m182,COLE,They used to hang people here.
94869,L509339,u2791,m182,MR. CUNNINGHAM,"Yes, Cole?"
94870,L509408,u2788,m182,LYNN,I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
94871,L509407,u2787,m182,DARREN'S MOM,Good for you.
94872,L509406,u2787,m182,DARREN'S MOM,J. C. Penny's?
94873,L509405,u2788,m182,LYNN,"I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school."
94874,L509403,u2788,m182,LYNN,Cheese. It's a kid's place.
94875,L509402,u2787,m182,DARREN'S MOM,Chuck E. who?
94876,L509401,u2788,m182,LYNN,The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
94877,L509400,u2787,m182,DARREN'S MOM,It's our pleasure.
94878,L509399,u2788,m182,LYNN,...He doesn't get invited places.
94879,L511066,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,"...Chicken blood? Who said it was... ""chicken blood""?"
94880,L511065,u2800,m183,MAC,Chicken blood on the crops.
94881,L511064,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
94882,L511063,u2800,m183,MAC,Superstition.
94883,L511062,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
94884,L511060,u2800,m183,MAC,"Let's say today, we make it your business."
94885,L511059,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,"'Course, it's none of my business."
94886,L511058,u2800,m183,MAC,What are you talking about?
94887,L511057,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,Maybe you don't want to remember.
94888,L511055,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,"Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did."
94889,L511054,u2800,m183,MAC,Meaning?
94890,L511053,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,"'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds."
94891,L510653,u2800,m183,MAC,How'd he know I'd come?
94892,L510652,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
94893,L510908,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
94894,L510907,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!"
94895,L510905,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
94896,L510904,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?"
94897,L510890,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
94898,L510889,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?"
94899,L510888,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,You were a beat and a quarter behind.
94900,L510887,u2799,m183,KEITH,See?
94901,L510886,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,Nope.
94902,L510885,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Yo. ""Billy Bob"". Was I two beats behind, or what?"
94903,L510848,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,Two.. maybe three days.
94904,L510847,u2799,m183,KEITH,"What's a ""little while?"""
94905,L510846,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,"Could take a little while, though."
94906,L510845,u2799,m183,KEITH,Alright!
94907,L510844,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
94908,L510658,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,You're standing in horseshit.
94909,L510657,u2799,m183,KEITH,Oh yeah? Why's that?
94910,L510656,u2792,m183,BILLY BOB,"I'd watch your step if I were you, son."

94944,L510999,u2794,m183,CARL,"Suzie, face it. The only ""axe"" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you."

94946,L510995,u2794,m183,CARL,Not someone -- Mac.
94947,L510994,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
94948,L510993,u2794,m183,CARL,I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
94949,L510992,u2803,m183,SUZIE,No shit.
94950,L510991,u2794,m183,CARL,"There's something weird going on here, Suzie."

94954,L510972,u2794,m183,CARL,"Hey, isn't that the preacher?"
94955,L510841,u2794,m183,CARL,I didn't do anything --
94956,L510840,u2803,m183,SUZIE,"How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!"
94957,L510839,u2794,m183,CARL,Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
94958,L510838,u2803,m183,SUZIE,Looks like the alternator.
94959,L510984,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,"Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime."
94960,L510983,u2795,m183,GENE,"You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah."
94961,L510980,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,Bus broke down.
94962,L510979,u2795,m183,GENE,Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
94963,L510971,u2795,m183,GENE,Book of Jeremiah.
94964,L510970,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,Sounds familiar.

94967,L510967,u2795,m183,GENE,"Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah."
94968,L510966,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,Gene.
94969,L510660,u2796,m183,IAN,I thought you said two hundred.

94977,L510596,u2799,m183,KEITH,Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
94978,L510595,u2796,m183,IAN,"All right. ""Fratricide"". Minor technical detail."
94979,L510594,u2799,m183,KEITH,That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
94980,L510593,u2796,m183,IAN,Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
94981,L510592,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Wait a second. Did you say ""patricide?"""

95026,L511079,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
95027,L511078,u2800,m183,MAC,People say he was a murderer.
95028,L511077,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,Sure. What do you want to know.
95029,L511076,u2800,m183,MAC,"That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little ""talk"" about grandaddy Jethro."

95045,L510683,u2800,m183,MAC,"How... was she ""called?"""
95046,L510682,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
95047,L510681,u2800,m183,MAC,I'll be gone again tomorrow.
95048,L510680,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
95049,L510679,u2800,m183,MAC,I came back for the funeral. That's all.
95050,L510675,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,"Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it."
95051,L510674,u2800,m183,MAC,Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
95052,L510673,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,"Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!"
95053,L510672,u2800,m183,MAC,I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
95054,L510671,u2800,m183,MAC,You know who I am. You invited me.
95055,L510670,u2797,m183,JEREMIAH,Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
95056,L510669,u2800,m183,MAC,What are you going to do? Shoot me?
95057,L510519,u2798,m183,KAREN,Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
95058,L510518,u2801,m183,RAY,Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
95059,L510517,u2801,m183,RAY,Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
95060,L510516,u2798,m183,KAREN,What's wrong?
95061,L510515,u2801,m183,RAY,Ow!
95062,L510513,u2798,m183,KAREN,-- By way of my breasts?
95063,L510512,u2801,m183,RAY,"Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse."
95064,L510511,u2798,m183,KAREN,Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
95065,L510507,u2801,m183,RAY,You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
95066,L510506,u2798,m183,KAREN,"I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death."
95067,L510505,u2801,m183,RAY,Never heard of it.
95068,L510504,u2798,m183,KAREN,"Sheena, Queen of the Jungle."
95069,L510503,u2801,m183,RAY,"I'm admiring your costume. What ""movie"" are you going as again?"
95070,L510502,u2798,m183,KAREN,-- And keep your eyes on the road.
95071,L510501,u2798,m183,KAREN,Not while you're driving.
95072,L510500,u2801,m183,RAY,Throw me one.
95073,L510883,u2803,m183,SUZIE,He's right. You were behind.
95074,L510882,u2799,m183,KEITH,"What the fuck you talking about, man?"
95075,L510835,u2803,m183,SUZIE,Amen.
95076,L510834,u2799,m183,KEITH,Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
95077,L510812,u2799,m183,KEITH,What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
95078,L510811,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
95079,L510810,u2799,m183,KEITH,He started it.
95080,L510809,u2803,m183,SUZIE,"It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster."
95081,L510647,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: ""Bobby- Joe"" --"
95082,L510646,u2803,m183,SUZIE,"You got something against farm people, Keith?"
95083,L510645,u2799,m183,KEITH,Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
95084,L510632,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Who you callin' ""boy?"""
95085,L510631,u2803,m183,SUZIE,Down boy.
95086,L510630,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet."
95087,L510629,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You know what they say about men who need big guns...
95088,L510608,u2799,m183,KEITH,Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
95089,L510607,u2803,m183,SUZIE,Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
95090,L510557,u2803,m183,SUZIE,The audience!
95091,L510556,u2799,m183,KEITH,Who? Us?!

95093,L510881,u2802,m183,ROD,Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
95094,L510880,u2799,m183,KEITH,You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
95095,L510606,u2799,m183,KEITH,Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
95096,L510605,u2802,m183,ROD,Bzzzzzzzzzt!
95097,L510604,u2799,m183,KEITH,Chicken sandwich?
95098,L510603,u2802,m183,ROD,"Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!"
95099,L510602,u2799,m183,KEITH,Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
95100,L510913,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind."
95101,L510912,u2800,m183,MAC,Is that right?
95102,L510911,u2799,m183,KEITH,Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
95103,L510910,u2800,m183,MAC,"How does it feel, Keith?"
95104,L510893,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens."
95105,L510892,u2800,m183,MAC,You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
95106,L510843,u2800,m183,MAC,"Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl."
95107,L510842,u2799,m183,KEITH,Yeah. That's just the problem.
95108,L510628,u2799,m183,KEITH,"Yeah. That sounds good. ""Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig""."
95109,L510627,u2800,m183,MAC,Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
95110,L510575,u2800,m183,MAC,Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
95111,L510574,u2799,m183,KEITH,Yes!
95112,L510573,u2800,m183,MAC,"Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today."
95113,L510572,u2799,m183,KEITH,Shit!
95114,L511195,u2800,m183,MAC,Never.
95115,L511194,u2803,m183,SUZIE,I almost thought for a second...
95116,L511187,u2800,m183,MAC,"Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together..."

95118,L511172,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
95119,L511171,u2800,m183,MAC,The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
95120,L511160,u2803,m183,SUZIE,No. Not without you --
95121,L511159,u2800,m183,MAC,Get out of here.

95123,L511156,u2803,m183,SUZIE,Mac... let's get out of here.
95124,L511152,u2800,m183,MAC,Don't look.
95125,L511151,u2803,m183,SUZIE,"No Mac, please... I --"
95126,L511147,u2800,m183,MAC,Suzie --
95127,L511146,u2803,m183,SUZIE,"You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --"
95128,L511145,u2800,m183,MAC,Listen to me --
95129,L511144,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
95130,L511143,u2800,m183,MAC,No --
95131,L511142,u2803,m183,SUZIE,It's you. You and your father.
95132,L511141,u2800,m183,MAC,Suzie... No.
95133,L511140,u2800,m183,MAC,I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
95134,L511139,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You're... limping.
95135,L511138,u2800,m183,MAC,"-- You're not making sense!! What ""Scarecrow""?"

95140,L511133,u2803,m183,SUZIE,Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
95141,L511132,u2800,m183,MAC,Suzie --
95142,L510897,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You never had trouble communicating before.

95146,L510821,u2803,m183,SUZIE,I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
95147,L510820,u2800,m183,MAC,Look. You want to talk about this?
95148,L510819,u2803,m183,SUZIE,Getting ready.

95150,L510817,u2803,m183,SUZIE,How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
95151,L510816,u2800,m183,MAC,I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
95152,L510815,u2803,m183,SUZIE,We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
95153,L510801,u2800,m183,MAC,I said that's enough!
95154,L510800,u2803,m183,SUZIE,"Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... ""Jethro."""
95155,L510799,u2803,m183,SUZIE,"I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch."
95156,L510798,u2800,m183,MAC,Let it go.
95157,L510797,u2803,m183,SUZIE,I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
95158,L510794,u2800,m183,MAC,When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
95159,L510793,u2803,m183,SUZIE,So?

95167,L510617,u2803,m183,SUZIE,About what?
95168,L510616,u2800,m183,MAC,My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
95169,L510614,u2800,m183,MAC,Nothing to tell.
95170,L510613,u2803,m183,SUZIE,You never told us you grew up on a farm.

95207,L513702,u2808,m184,JACK,"Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out."

95234,L513958,u2812,m184,STARLA,"That wasn't a good night, no."
95235,L513957,u2804,m184,BILL,"When you wanted to run away, I called your dad."
95236,L513956,u2812,m184,STARLA,"My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck."
95237,L513955,u2804,m184,BILL,"Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too."
95238,L513954,u2812,m184,STARLA,Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
95239,L513953,u2812,m184,STARLA,"I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?"
95240,L513952,u2804,m184,BILL,Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
95241,L513843,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there."
95242,L513842,u2804,m184,BILL,No reception out here.
95243,L513756,u2812,m184,STARLA,"It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it."
95244,L513755,u2804,m184,BILL,"Starla, it ain't --"
95245,L513754,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it."
95246,L513753,u2812,m184,STARLA,He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
95247,L513752,u2804,m184,BILL,"He tried to kill you, Starla."
95248,L513751,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --"
95249,L513750,u2804,m184,BILL,"Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go."
95250,L513749,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along."
95251,L513693,u2804,m184,BILL,"New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her."
95252,L513692,u2812,m184,STARLA,How about Brenda?
95253,L513666,u2804,m184,BILL,She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
95254,L513665,u2812,m184,STARLA,No. What?
95255,L513664,u2804,m184,BILL,"Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?"
95256,L513637,u2804,m184,BILL,"Hey, Grant."
95257,L513636,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Grant, where'd you go?"
95258,L513633,u2812,m184,STARLA,I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
95259,L513632,u2804,m184,BILL,"Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me."
95260,L513631,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Oh, yeah?"
95261,L513630,u2804,m184,BILL,"There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope."
95262,L513629,u2804,m184,BILL,Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
95263,L513628,u2812,m184,STARLA,I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
95264,L513627,u2804,m184,BILL,"Pretty, ain't they?"
95265,L513626,u2812,m184,STARLA,Just checking out the lights.
95266,L513625,u2804,m184,BILL,What you up to?
95267,L513624,u2804,m184,BILL,Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
95268,L513623,u2812,m184,STARLA,Whatcha' doin'?
95269,L513622,u2804,m184,BILL,Sorry.
95270,L513621,u2812,m184,STARLA,That's not funny.
95271,L513620,u2804,m184,BILL,Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
95272,L513980,u2804,m184,BILL,"Just block the doors, any way you can."
95273,L513979,u2813,m184,TREVOR,What the hell are we going to do?!
95274,L513972,u2804,m184,BILL,Shelby!
95275,L513971,u2813,m184,TREVOR,"When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!"
95276,L513937,u2804,m184,BILL,"A Martian is from Mars, Trevor."
95277,L513936,u2813,m184,TREVOR,He's a fucking Martian?!
95278,L513898,u2813,m184,TREVOR,"We're coming your way, man!"
95279,L513897,u2804,m184,BILL,Where are you?!
95280,L513741,u2813,m184,TREVOR,"I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?"
95281,L513740,u2804,m184,BILL,"And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place."
95282,L513733,u2813,m184,TREVOR,"Think we should get up a search party, head in there?"
95283,L513732,u2804,m184,BILL,He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
95284,L513593,u2804,m184,BILL,"That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger."
95285,L513592,u2813,m184,TREVOR,What's she see in that douchebag?
95286,L513805,u2814,m184,WALLY,"What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?"
95287,L513804,u2804,m184,BILL,I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
95288,L513739,u2804,m184,BILL,"Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally."
95289,L513738,u2814,m184,WALLY,Looks like a chipmunk.
95290,L513722,u2814,m184,WALLY,What do you see? I see a butterfly.
95291,L513721,u2804,m184,BILL,Rorschach.
95292,L513668,u2804,m184,BILL,"The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant."
95293,L513667,u2814,m184,WALLY,"Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock."
95294,L513643,u2804,m184,BILL,"Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass."
95295,L513642,u2814,m184,WALLY,What?
95296,L513641,u2804,m184,BILL,"Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you..."
95297,L513640,u2814,m184,WALLY,Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
95298,L513975,u2811,m184,SHELBY,"Don't worry, Chief."
95299,L513974,u2804,m184,BILL,Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
95300,L513973,u2811,m184,SHELBY,"Hey there, Chief."
95301,L513950,u2804,m184,BILL,Do it.
95302,L513949,u2811,m184,SHELBY,I got to leave my post.
95303,L513948,u2804,m184,BILL,"Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up."
95304,L513918,u2804,m184,BILL,We'll be there in ten minutes.
95305,L513917,u2811,m184,SHELBY,Sorry.
95306,L513916,u2804,m184,BILL,I can't hear when you're nodding.
95307,L513915,u2811,m184,SHELBY,Yeah.
95308,L513914,u2804,m184,BILL,Are you nodding?
95309,L513913,u2804,m184,BILL,"Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?"
95310,L513912,u2811,m184,SHELBY,"Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog"
95311,L513911,u2804,m184,BILL,Shelby --
95312,L513910,u2811,m184,SHELBY,Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
95313,L513909,u2804,m184,BILL,"Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast."
95314,L513908,u2811,m184,SHELBY,You dig that rat out of the hole?
95315,L513656,u2807,m184,GRANT,Brought you munchies.
95316,L513655,u2805,m184,BRENDA,"Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die."
95317,L513615,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt."
95318,L513614,u2805,m184,BRENDA,What?
95319,L513613,u2807,m184,GRANT,Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
95320,L513610,u2805,m184,BRENDA,Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
95321,L513609,u2807,m184,GRANT,Where's the old half--Mexican?
95322,L513608,u2805,m184,BRENDA,Shut up.
95323,L513607,u2807,m184,GRANT,You're lookin' awful pretty.
95324,L513527,u2805,m184,BRENDA,Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
95325,L513526,u2807,m184,GRANT,Already ain't. Married a gal named --
95326,L513525,u2805,m184,BRENDA,Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
95327,L513524,u2807,m184,GRANT,Who's the lucky fella?
95328,L513523,u2805,m184,BRENDA,"Hell, I was game!"
95329,L513522,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven."
95330,L513521,u2805,m184,BRENDA,"My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?"
95331,L513519,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --"
95332,L513518,u2805,m184,BRENDA,Megan Halesy' little sister.
95333,L513567,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?..."
95334,L513566,u2806,m184,BUTCHER,All the rib eyes?
95335,L513565,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?"
95336,L513563,u2806,m184,BUTCHER,How many you need?
95337,L513562,u2807,m184,GRANT,Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
95338,L513561,u2806,m184,BUTCHER,What can I do you for?
95339,L513560,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Sure thing, killer."
95340,L513559,u2806,m184,BUTCHER,"Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?"
95341,L513558,u2807,m184,GRANT,Meat.
95342,L513678,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Grant, you're sick!"
95343,L513677,u2807,m184,GRANT,I loved you. I loved --
95344,L513676,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Grant, no!"
95345,L513675,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!"
95346,L513654,u2807,m184,GRANT,No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
95347,L513653,u2812,m184,STARLA,I'll get if for you.
95348,L513651,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days."
95349,L513650,u2812,m184,STARLA,Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
95350,L513591,u2812,m184,STARLA,"It's just one of my students, Grant."
95351,L513590,u2807,m184,GRANT,Who's that?
95352,L513589,u2807,m184,GRANT,You're pretty.
95353,L513588,u2812,m184,STARLA,What are you doing?
95354,L513577,u2807,m184,GRANT,"I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors."
95355,L513576,u2812,m184,STARLA,Okay.
95356,L513575,u2807,m184,GRANT,"You're my princess, aren't you?"
95357,L513574,u2812,m184,STARLA,My present?
95358,L513573,u2807,m184,GRANT,Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
95359,L513571,u2812,m184,STARLA,Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
95360,L513570,u2807,m184,GRANT,Welcome home.
95361,L513547,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it."
95362,L513546,u2812,m184,STARLA,I never danced in a towel before.
95363,L513514,u2807,m184,GRANT,Out.
95364,L513513,u2812,m184,STARLA,That's not true -- Where are you--?
95365,L513512,u2807,m184,GRANT,"I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?"
95366,L513511,u2812,m184,STARLA,Where are you going?
95367,L513509,u2812,m184,STARLA,That's disrespectful.
95368,L513508,u2807,m184,GRANT,Flip.
95369,L513506,u2807,m184,GRANT,Sure you do.
95370,L513505,u2812,m184,STARLA,I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
95371,L513504,u2812,m184,STARLA,"Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --"
95372,L513500,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks."
95373,L513499,u2812,m184,STARLA,It's just a work thing.
95374,L513498,u2807,m184,GRANT,"Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy."
95375,L513497,u2812,m184,STARLA,"He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester."
95376,L513945,u2812,m184,STARLA,"An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease."
95377,L513944,u2809,m184,KYLIE,When one sees you they all see you.
95378,L513943,u2812,m184,STARLA,"And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?"
95379,L513942,u2809,m184,KYLIE,"He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change."
95380,L513941,u2812,m184,STARLA,Through a wound on his stomach?
95381,L513940,u2809,m184,KYLIE,Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
95382,L513935,u2812,m184,STARLA,What other stuff?
95383,L513934,u2809,m184,KYLIE,But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
95384,L513858,u2813,m184,TREVOR,Margaret.
95385,L513857,u2810,m184,MARGARET,Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
95386,L513839,u2813,m184,TREVOR,"'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret."
95387,L513838,u2810,m184,MARGARET,Praise Jesus.
95388,L513787,u2810,m184,MARGARET,We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
95389,L513786,u2813,m184,TREVOR,Where'd he go?
95390,L513728,u2813,m184,TREVOR,"Hey, look!"
95391,L513727,u2810,m184,MARGARET,So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
95392,L513595,u2813,m184,TREVOR,"Gold--digger, huh?"
95393,L513594,u2810,m184,MARGARET,Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
95394,L515526,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Your what?
95395,L515525,u2816,m185,CLAYTON,Get your hands off my daughter!
95396,L515349,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios."
95397,L515348,u2816,m185,CLAYTON,"You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck."
95398,L515347,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Yeah, well I kinda figured that."
95399,L515346,u2816,m185,CLAYTON,You.
95400,L515345,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?"
95401,L515344,u2816,m185,CLAYTON,Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
95402,L515511,u2815,m185,BANDIT,What do you think?
95403,L515510,u2821,m185,KYLE,You got my barley pop?
95404,L514958,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You paying for the gas?
95405,L514957,u2821,m185,KYLE,Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
95406,L514956,u2815,m185,BANDIT,How much style?
95407,L514955,u2821,m185,KYLE,"I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style."
95408,L514951,u2821,m185,KYLE,But it wasn't a Kenworth.
95409,L514950,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Last year, this was a new rig."
95410,L514949,u2821,m185,KYLE,"Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig."
95411,L514946,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You know how rumors start.
95412,L514945,u2821,m185,KYLE,I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
95413,L514942,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
95414,L514941,u2821,m185,KYLE,What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
95415,L514940,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy."
95416,L514939,u2821,m185,KYLE,You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
95417,L514938,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"America's bored.  Now, what do you want?"
95418,L514937,u2821,m185,KYLE,I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
95419,L514932,u2815,m185,BANDIT,If...?
95420,L514931,u2821,m185,KYLE,What's he get if he wins here?
95421,L514930,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Yeah, it's the highlight of my day."
95422,L514929,u2821,m185,KYLE,"Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?"
95423,L515537,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"See ya, Kate."
95424,L515536,u2820,m185,KATE,"See ya, Bandit."
95425,L515533,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You gotta admire the man's determination.
95426,L515532,u2820,m185,KATE,What are you thinking?
95427,L515531,u2820,m185,KATE,"Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking."
95428,L515530,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Absolutely.
95429,L515529,u2820,m185,KATE,"I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?"
95430,L515528,u2815,m185,BANDIT,That man is your father?!?
95431,L515527,u2820,m185,KATE,He's just exhausted.
95432,L515524,u2820,m185,KATE,Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
95433,L515523,u2815,m185,BANDIT,What can I say?
95434,L515522,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Hey...
95435,L515521,u2820,m185,KATE,"Well, thanks for the lift."
95436,L515520,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Well, at least it hasn't been boring."
95437,L515515,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
95438,L515514,u2820,m185,KATE,One to five?
95439,L515456,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Weight Station.
95440,L515455,u2820,m185,KATE,Why are you stopping?
95441,L515443,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
95442,L515442,u2820,m185,KATE,What are you gonna do when you get home?
95443,L515434,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"The minute you see him, you'll know."
95444,L515433,u2820,m185,KATE,What kind of a guy is he?
95445,L515432,u2815,m185,BANDIT,It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
95446,L515431,u2820,m185,KATE,-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
95447,L515418,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Bandit II?
95448,L515417,u2820,m185,KATE,They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
95449,L515416,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'."
95450,L515415,u2820,m185,KATE,My very words.
95451,L515414,u2820,m185,KATE,He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
95452,L515413,u2815,m185,BANDIT,And?
95453,L515412,u2820,m185,KATE,"-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it."
95454,L515386,u2820,m185,KATE,Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
95455,L515385,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta."
95456,L515384,u2820,m185,KATE,Ummm?
95457,L515383,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Kate...
95458,L515366,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
95459,L515365,u2820,m185,KATE,Yeah?
95460,L515364,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I'm proud of you.
95461,L515330,u2820,m185,KATE,"You take the front, I'll take the back."
95462,L515329,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
95463,L515323,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in."
95464,L515322,u2820,m185,KATE,How do you know?
95465,L515321,u2815,m185,BANDIT,An unmarked police car.
95466,L515318,u2820,m185,KATE,Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
95467,L515317,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
95468,L515316,u2820,m185,KATE,You plan on driving trucks all your life?
95469,L515315,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?"
95470,L515314,u2820,m185,KATE,Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
95471,L515313,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?"
95472,L515312,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon."
95473,L515311,u2820,m185,KATE,You plan on driving trucks all your life?
95474,L515307,u2820,m185,KATE,"Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'."
95475,L515306,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Let's hit it.
95476,L515285,u2820,m185,KATE,Uh-oh.
95477,L515284,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset."
95478,L515283,u2820,m185,KATE,"-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds..."
95479,L515282,u2820,m185,KATE,You want to lose this putz or not?!?
95480,L515281,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Mississippi's the other way!
95481,L515266,u2820,m185,KATE,Like what?
95482,L515265,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Where did you learn how to drive like this?
95483,L515264,u2820,m185,KATE,You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
95484,L515263,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You could've asked.
95485,L515262,u2820,m185,KATE,"Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse."
95486,L515260,u2820,m185,KATE,Yeah.
95487,L515259,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Yeah.
95488,L515258,u2820,m185,KATE,I would've come back for you.
95489,L515257,u2815,m185,BANDIT,By stealing my car?
95490,L515256,u2820,m185,KATE,I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
95491,L515255,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"You know this guy, don't you?"
95492,L515254,u2820,m185,KATE,He's after us again!
95493,L515253,u2815,m185,BANDIT,What the hell are you doing?!?
95494,L515228,u2820,m185,KATE,Ciao.
95495,L515227,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"See ya, Kate."
95496,L515224,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound."
95497,L515223,u2820,m185,KATE,Jesus!!!
95498,L515210,u2820,m185,KATE,Enjoy your Kenworth.
95499,L515209,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Hey...
95500,L515208,u2820,m185,KATE,Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
95501,L515207,u2815,m185,BANDIT,The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
95502,L515197,u2820,m185,KATE,Eleven.
95503,L515196,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Christ, what channel are we on?..."
95504,L515195,u2820,m185,KATE,I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
95505,L515194,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
95506,L515174,u2820,m185,KATE,We lost him.
95507,L515173,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Well?
95508,L515154,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of."
95509,L515153,u2820,m185,KATE,"You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless."
95510,L515149,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is."
95511,L515148,u2820,m185,KATE,I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
95512,L515147,u2815,m185,BANDIT,That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
95513,L515132,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"You know, you're not a bad passenger."
95514,L515131,u2820,m185,KATE,"You know, you're not a bad driver."
95515,L515116,u2820,m185,KATE,What do you want to be when you grow up?
95516,L515115,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Shoot.
95517,L515114,u2820,m185,KATE,Can I ask you something?
95518,L515113,u2820,m185,KATE,We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
95519,L515112,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Anything?
95520,L515110,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
95521,L515109,u2820,m185,KATE,What the hell's going on?
95522,L515103,u2820,m185,KATE,You just passed your nemesis.
95523,L515102,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I give up.
95524,L515101,u2820,m185,KATE,Guess what?
95525,L515100,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Would I lie to you?
95526,L515099,u2820,m185,KATE,Seriously?!?
95527,L515098,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement."
95528,L515097,u2820,m185,KATE,Where you from?
95529,L515096,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle."
95530,L515095,u2820,m185,KATE,You have a great profile.
95531,L515094,u2815,m185,BANDIT,They're both a challenge.
95532,L515093,u2820,m185,KATE,"Driving, talking to me..."
95533,L515092,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Driving?
95534,L515091,u2820,m185,KATE,Is this fun?
95535,L515090,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Having fun.
95536,L515089,u2820,m185,KATE,No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
95537,L515088,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Whaddya want to know? My sign?
95538,L515087,u2820,m185,KATE,Well?...
95539,L515086,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Okay.
95540,L515085,u2820,m185,KATE,So tell me about yourself.
95541,L515084,u2820,m185,KATE,Eyes on the road.
95542,L515083,u2815,m185,BANDIT,A what?
95543,L515082,u2820,m185,KATE,An existentialist.
95544,L515081,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Hey, you could get killed crossing the street."
95545,L515080,u2820,m185,KATE,"But you could get killed, right?"
95546,L515079,u2815,m185,BANDIT,It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
95547,L515078,u2820,m185,KATE,A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
95548,L515077,u2815,m185,BANDIT,For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
95549,L515076,u2820,m185,KATE,Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
95550,L515075,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
95551,L515074,u2820,m185,KATE,Who'd want to?
95552,L515073,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours."
95553,L515072,u2820,m185,KATE,Why? You have a bowling date?
95554,L515071,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
95555,L515070,u2820,m185,KATE,Why're you driving so fast?
95556,L515060,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole."
95557,L515059,u2820,m185,KATE,Kate McConnell.
95558,L515055,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer."
95559,L515054,u2820,m185,KATE,"Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?"
95560,L515053,u2815,m185,BANDIT,All sound reasons for matrimony.
95561,L515052,u2820,m185,KATE,"Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite."
95562,L515493,u2819,m185,HOT PANTS,You sure do.
95563,L515492,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"I owe you a big one, Hot Pants."
95564,L515491,u2819,m185,HOT PANTS,I'll do it.
95565,L515490,u2815,m185,BANDIT,But you'll do it?
95566,L515489,u2819,m185,HOT PANTS,I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
95567,L515488,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I'm begging.
95568,L515487,u2819,m185,HOT PANTS,Yes.
95569,L515486,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?"
95570,L515485,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?"
95571,L515484,u2819,m185,HOT PANTS,"I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?"
95572,L515483,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad."
95573,L515482,u2819,m185,HOT PANTS,Why should I?
95574,L515230,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Another time.
95575,L515229,u2826,m185,WAITRESS,Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
95576,L515226,u2815,m185,BANDIT,That's me.
95577,L515225,u2826,m185,WAITRESS,Order up!
95578,L515214,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
95579,L515213,u2826,m185,WAITRESS,No what?
95580,L515212,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments..."
95581,L515211,u2826,m185,WAITRESS,What's your pleasure?
95582,L515507,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through."
95583,L515506,u2815,m185,BANDIT,But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
95584,L515505,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?"
95585,L515504,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Yeah, but..."
95586,L515503,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far."
95587,L515496,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way."
95588,L515495,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"How's the clock, Bandit II."
95589,L515480,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup."
95590,L515479,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"What's that, pardner?"
95591,L515478,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice."
95592,L515460,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I'm cucumber cool.
95593,L515459,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You're coming up to the scale house.
95594,L515458,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I'm here.
95595,L515457,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Bandit II?
95596,L515453,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
95597,L515452,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I'm all ears.
95598,L515421,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Let's boogie.
95599,L515420,u2815,m185,BANDIT,We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
95600,L515419,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Talk to me.
95601,L515411,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,It's gonna be close. Real close.
95602,L515410,u2815,m185,BANDIT,-- How we doing?
95603,L515408,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?"
95604,L515407,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'."
95605,L515406,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Just fine. What's the weather like?
95606,L515405,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You okay?
95607,L515404,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
95608,L515375,u2815,m185,BANDIT,We'll be waiting. Over.
95609,L515374,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
95610,L515373,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp."
95611,L515372,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"I'm all ears, good buddy."
95612,L515355,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I'll believe it when I see it.
95613,L515354,u2815,m185,BANDIT,-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
95614,L515335,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
95615,L515334,u2815,m185,BANDIT,We're outta motion lotion.
95616,L515333,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Now what?
95617,L515332,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop."
95618,L515328,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
95619,L515327,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Anything else you don't want me to know?
95620,L515326,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Never mind. It's nothing.
95621,L515304,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Bandit?
95622,L515303,u2815,m185,BANDIT,We're gone.
95623,L515302,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
95624,L515301,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
95625,L515300,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but..."
95626,L515299,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Then don't.
95627,L515298,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I hate to say it...
95628,L515297,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I ran into complications.
95629,L515296,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
95630,L515291,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
95631,L515290,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I'm at marker eight-five.
95632,L515289,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"-- Gimme a twenty, pardner."
95633,L515278,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye."
95634,L515277,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss."
95635,L515276,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
95636,L515275,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
95637,L515273,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
95638,L515272,u2815,m185,BANDIT,What's your twenty?
95639,L515271,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Do I have a choice?
95640,L515270,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?"
95641,L515269,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?"
95642,L515205,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.
95643,L515204,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Yeah, guy?"
95644,L515203,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Bandit?
95645,L515202,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto."
95646,L515201,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
95647,L515200,u2815,m185,BANDIT,What does the old Timex say?
95648,L515199,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts."
95649,L515162,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl."
95650,L515161,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?"
95651,L515139,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Not for long, you ain't."
95652,L515138,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey."
95653,L515137,u2815,m185,BANDIT,What's your twenty?
95654,L515136,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
95655,L515135,u2815,m185,BANDIT,On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
95656,L515134,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?"
95657,L515124,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
95658,L515123,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"What's going on, Bandit? Come on."
95659,L515122,u2815,m185,BANDIT,You can't swear on these.
95660,L515057,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"This is Bandit I, come back."
95661,L515056,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Bandit I, do you copy?"
95662,L515048,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Clear and rolling.
95663,L515047,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Save it. We got a long haul.
95664,L515046,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I hate to say I told you so.
95665,L515045,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Forty-two minutes ahead.
95666,L515044,u2815,m185,BANDIT,We still on schedule?
95667,L515043,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
95668,L515042,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
95669,L515041,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Let's get the hell outta here.
95670,L515039,u2815,m185,BANDIT,They're jammed!
95671,L515038,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Hit the brakes!
95672,L515037,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Can a pig whistle?
95673,L515036,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,You know how to drive one of these things?
95674,L515035,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Redneck heaven.
95675,L515034,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Liquid gold.
95676,L515033,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Let's keep it that way.
95677,L515032,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
95678,L515031,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Shit! No one's here.
95679,L515030,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll."
95680,L515029,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,He's history.
95681,L515028,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you."
95682,L515027,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Loud and clear.
95683,L515025,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Because they said it couldn't be done.
95684,L515024,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Why are we doing this?
95685,L515023,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Yeah?
95686,L515022,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Bandit?
95687,L515021,u2815,m185,BANDIT,I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
95688,L515020,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
95689,L515018,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass."
95690,L515017,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"If I say go to two, it's really one."
95691,L515016,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Twenty-one is nineteen.
95692,L515015,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen."
95693,L515014,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Six. Got it.
95694,L515013,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six."
95695,L515012,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Go.
95696,L515011,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey."
95697,L515010,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Running blocker.
95698,L515009,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,What are you doin' now?
95699,L515008,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,But I still don't think...
95700,L515007,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Also boring.
95701,L515006,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law."
95702,L515005,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time."
95703,L515004,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"I don't know, man. Ask him?"
95704,L515003,u2815,m185,BANDIT,How long's this gonna take?
95705,L515002,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth."
95706,L515001,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
95707,L515000,u2815,m185,BANDIT,See.
95708,L514999,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,No.
95709,L514998,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?"
95710,L514997,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it."
95711,L514995,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset."
95712,L514994,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem."
95713,L514987,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Waynette!
95714,L514986,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
95715,L514985,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Or in the slammer.
95716,L514984,u2815,m185,BANDIT,No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
95717,L514983,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
95718,L514982,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way."
95719,L514981,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
95720,L514979,u2815,m185,BANDIT,How'd you know?
95721,L514978,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
95722,L514977,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks."
95723,L514976,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,No.
95724,L514975,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Cledus.
95725,L515447,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?"
95726,L515446,u2823,m185,VOICE,"Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?"
95727,L515445,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?"
95728,L515359,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"What's up, Dixie Chicken?"
95729,L515358,u2823,m185,VOICE,"Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken."
95730,L515357,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Pick it up, Breaker."
95731,L515356,u2823,m185,VOICE,Breaker. Breaker.
95732,L515178,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil."
95733,L515177,u2823,m185,VOICE,"My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all."
95734,L515146,u2823,m185,VOICE,My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
95735,L515145,u2815,m185,BANDIT,What's your twenty and what's your handle?
95736,L515144,u2823,m185,VOICE,"I would say your future's looking dim, boss."
95737,L515143,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"Go head on, breaker."
95738,L515142,u2823,m185,VOICE,"Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you."
95739,L515141,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Go breaker.
95740,L515140,u2823,m185,VOICE,Breaker. Breaker.
95741,L515513,u2815,m185,BANDIT,About one to five years worth.

95744,L514953,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
95745,L514952,u2818,m185,DICKEY,"Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou."
95746,L514948,u2815,m185,BANDIT,Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
95747,L514947,u2818,m185,DICKEY,I think you're just yellow.
95748,L514944,u2815,m185,BANDIT,"See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger."
95749,L514943,u2818,m185,DICKEY,"It ain't ever been done before, hot shit."
95750,L515382,u2822,m185,OWNER,"I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it."
95751,L515381,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Oh, yeah. Good for him."
95752,L515380,u2822,m185,OWNER,Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
95753,L515379,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Uh-uh. What Cobra?
95754,L515378,u2822,m185,OWNER,You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
95755,L515377,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
95756,L515424,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
95757,L515423,u2820,m185,KATE,"Bandit two, you read me?"
95758,L515294,u2820,m185,KATE,How's your twenty?
95759,L515293,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Yes, ma'am."
95760,L515292,u2820,m185,KATE,I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
95761,L515159,u2820,m185,KATE,What's he...
95762,L515158,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
95763,L515157,u2820,m185,KATE,"Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?"
95764,L515128,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
95765,L515127,u2820,m185,KATE,Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
95766,L515126,u2820,m185,KATE,Who's Fred?
95767,L515125,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Shut up, Fred."
95768,L515121,u2820,m185,KATE,Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
95769,L515120,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,Where the hell are you?
95770,L515119,u2820,m185,KATE,This is Bandit I. Over.
95771,L515062,u2820,m185,KATE,"Believe me, that won't be a problem."
95772,L515061,u2817,m185,CLEDUS,"Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid."
95773,L515509,u2818,m185,DICKEY,Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
95774,L515508,u2821,m185,KYLE,That crazy sumbitch made it.
95775,L514934,u2821,m185,KYLE,Chickenshit money.
95776,L514933,u2818,m185,DICKEY,Five thou.
95777,L514925,u2818,m185,DICKEY,"Yes, sir."
95778,L514924,u2821,m185,KYLE,"Now, you just find him, son."
95779,L514923,u2818,m185,DICKEY,Oh.
95780,L514922,u2821,m185,KYLE,"That's the point, Dickey."
95781,L514921,u2818,m185,DICKEY,"But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?"
95782,L514920,u2821,m185,KYLE,"Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends."
95783,L514919,u2818,m185,DICKEY,Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
95784,L514918,u2821,m185,KYLE,Then it must be a helluva idea.
95785,L514917,u2818,m185,DICKEY,"I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop."
95786,L514916,u2821,m185,KYLE,"If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now."
95787,L514915,u2818,m185,DICKEY,Is that Bandit in the lead?
95788,L515541,u2825,m185,VOICE TWO,"-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money."
95789,L515540,u2824,m185,VOICE ONE,-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
95790,L515539,u2825,m185,VOICE TWO,"-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on."
95791,L515538,u2824,m185,VOICE ONE,"-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel."
95792,L514914,u2824,m185,VOICE ONE,"-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo."
95793,L514913,u2825,m185,VOICE TWO,-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
95794,L514912,u2824,m185,VOICE ONE,-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
95795,L514911,u2825,m185,VOICE TWO,"-- Yeah, Breaker go head on."
95796,L514910,u2824,m185,VOICE ONE,"-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel..."
95797,L515886,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,And who has access to that floor?
95798,L515885,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,Of course. Yes.
95799,L515884,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,Is your security team armed?
95800,L515883,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,"No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access."
95801,L515882,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,"C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this ""construction"" thing...?"
95802,L515880,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,So there are no guests staying on that floor?
95803,L515879,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,"Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --"
95804,L515878,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,You have a butler working that floor?
95805,L515877,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,"Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total."
95806,L515876,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,What kind of personnel?
95807,L515875,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,"Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day."
95808,L515874,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,-- so you shut them off?
95809,L515873,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,"Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--"
95810,L515872,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,"But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?"
95811,L515871,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,That's correct.
95812,L515870,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,"So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?"
95813,L515869,u2840,m186,SECURITY SUPERVISOR,"And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore."
95814,L515868,u2827,m186,ACOSTA,It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
95815,L516184,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,Yeah.
95816,L516183,u2838,m186,MESSNER,No.
95817,L516182,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,Mortal.
95818,L516181,u2838,m186,MESSNER,How bad?
95819,L515909,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,"No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake."
95820,L515908,u2838,m186,MESSNER,Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
95821,L515907,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,Maroon uniforms?
95822,L515899,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,"Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent."
95823,L515898,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"Deputy, have you made any ID's?"
95824,L515863,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
95825,L515862,u2838,m186,MESSNER,What about the sheriff's task force?
95826,L515861,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,"That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait."
95827,L515860,u2838,m186,MESSNER,Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
95828,L515859,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
95829,L515858,u2838,m186,MESSNER,He's giving them up?
95830,L515786,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,"Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters ""F.B.I."" in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times."
95831,L515785,u2838,m186,MESSNER,What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
95832,L515784,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
95833,L515783,u2838,m186,MESSNER,So he has no idea what's about to happen?
95834,L515781,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked."
95835,L515780,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,"Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness."
95836,L515779,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?"
95837,L515777,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west."
95838,L515776,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,"Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security."
95839,L515775,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be."
95840,L515773,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --"
95841,L515772,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
95842,L515704,u2838,m186,MESSNER,Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
95843,L515703,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,And a very bad gamble.
95844,L515702,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds."
95845,L515701,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,Maybe.
95846,L515700,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record."
95847,L515699,u2828,m186,CARRUTHERS,"Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate."
95848,L515698,u2838,m186,MESSNER,Anything on the Swede?
95849,L516138,u2838,m186,MESSNER,And that didn't seem odd to you?
95850,L516137,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,Yeah.
95851,L516136,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --"
95852,L516135,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,"Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said ""FBI"" on it."
95853,L516134,u2838,m186,MESSNER,You're sure?
95854,L516133,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,"Uh, yeah."
95855,L516132,u2838,m186,MESSNER,This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
95856,L516131,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,"The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets..."
95857,L516130,u2838,m186,MESSNER,Who?
95858,L516129,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
95859,L516128,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --"
95860,L516127,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,"Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --"
95861,L516126,u2838,m186,MESSNER,Did he give you his name?
95862,L516123,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?"
95863,L516122,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,"He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent."
95864,L516121,u2838,m186,MESSNER,-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
95865,L516120,u2829,m186,CASINO EMPLOYEE,"Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--"
95866,L516258,u2833,m186,ELMORE,"You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor."
95867,L516257,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,"Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad."
95868,L516256,u2833,m186,ELMORE,Two of 'em?
95869,L516255,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,"Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it."
95870,L516254,u2833,m186,ELMORE,But there were more of you?
95871,L516253,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,Mmm-hmm.
95872,L516252,u2833,m186,ELMORE,"And this is your car, isn't it?"
95873,L516251,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,"Pretty much, yep."
95874,L516250,u2833,m186,ELMORE,And threw us into the lake.
95875,L516249,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,"I did. We -- yeah, I know."
95876,L516248,u2833,m186,ELMORE,You shot me and murdered my friends.
95877,L516247,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,"Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry."
95878,L516243,u2833,m186,ELMORE,"Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long."
95879,L516242,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,Ww... uh...
95880,L516241,u2833,m186,ELMORE,You investigating those murders out at the lake?
95881,L515817,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,You think so?
95882,L515816,u2832,m186,DUPREE,"I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry."
95883,L515815,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,"Man, that's great."
95884,L515814,u2832,m186,DUPREE,I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
95885,L515813,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,Really?
95886,L515812,u2832,m186,DUPREE,"I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that."
95887,L515811,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,Damn... alright then.
95888,L515810,u2832,m186,DUPREE,Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
95889,L515809,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,You woulda?
95890,L515808,u2832,m186,DUPREE,"If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too."
95891,L515807,u2830,m186,DARWIN TREMOR,"Shoot, I appreciate that man."
95892,L515806,u2832,m186,DUPREE,...I forgive you Darwin.
95893,L515970,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"I sent Hugo, he should be there!"
95894,L515969,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,"I'm here, where's the car?"
95895,L515765,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport."
95896,L515764,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,"No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --"
95897,L515763,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry."
95898,L515762,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,"There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself."
95899,L515761,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,That's not possible. I told you.
95900,L515760,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,"-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you."
95901,L515756,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,"Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice."
95902,L515755,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,I'm not doing cocaine.
95903,L515754,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
95904,L515753,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,...About what?
95905,L515752,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,I've got concerns.
95906,L515750,u2831,m186,DR. GILL,"Yeah, why."
95907,L515749,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,Are you on a land line?
95908,L515801,u2833,m186,ELMORE,Then what --
95909,L515800,u2832,m186,DUPREE,"Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup."
95910,L515799,u2833,m186,ELMORE,I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
95911,L515798,u2832,m186,DUPREE,Your attitude sucks.
95912,L515797,u2833,m186,ELMORE,"-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?"
95913,L515796,u2832,m186,DUPREE,Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
95914,L515795,u2833,m186,ELMORE,"Yeah, we've been through that."
95915,L515645,u2833,m186,ELMORE,That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
95916,L515644,u2832,m186,DUPREE,"I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped."
95917,L515643,u2833,m186,ELMORE,"Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more."
95918,L515642,u2832,m186,DUPREE,So I guess you're not going.
95919,L515641,u2833,m186,ELMORE,"Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom."
95920,L515640,u2832,m186,DUPREE,"His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since."
95921,L515626,u2832,m186,DUPREE,"The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally."
95922,L515625,u2833,m186,ELMORE,What happened?
95923,L515844,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,That's right! RIGHT NOW!
95924,L515843,u2834,m186,HUGO,"Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!"
95925,L515692,u2834,m186,HUGO,"I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah."
95926,L515691,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,Without peer?
95927,L515690,u2834,m186,HUGO,I am. Yeah.
95928,L515689,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
95929,L515688,u2834,m186,HUGO,...I'm sorry...
95930,L515687,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"Only if you really, truly mean it."
95931,L515686,u2834,m186,HUGO,Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
95932,L515685,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"I was kinda hoping, yeah."
95933,L515684,u2834,m186,HUGO,Do you want me to say I did it?
95934,L515682,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?"
95935,L515681,u2834,m186,HUGO,I could have it sent out...
95936,L515680,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a ""tough, deep down stain."""
95937,L515679,u2834,m186,HUGO,I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
95938,L515677,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,Look at the collar on that coat...
95939,L515676,u2834,m186,HUGO,About what?
95940,L515675,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?"
95941,L515674,u2834,m186,HUGO,"I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned."
95942,L515673,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
95943,L515672,u2834,m186,HUGO,Okay.
95944,L515671,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
95945,L515670,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,I know you left him a message. What did you say!
95946,L515669,u2834,m186,HUGO,I left him a message.
95947,L515668,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"No, what did you say on the machine?"
95948,L515667,u2834,m186,HUGO,I said I got his machine.
95949,L515666,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,What'd you say?
95950,L515665,u2834,m186,HUGO,I got his machine.
95951,L515664,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,D'you talk to'm?
95952,L516081,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
95953,L516080,u2842,m186,SIR IVY,FUCK YOU!
95954,L516071,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
95955,L516070,u2842,m186,SIR IVY,"Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!"
95956,L516026,u2842,m186,SIR IVY,"...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know."
95957,L516025,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,That's probably him now...
95958,L515746,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink..."
95959,L515745,u2842,m186,SIR IVY,"We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's ""under construction."""
95960,L515744,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno..."
95961,L516164,u2837,m186,MECKLEN,"The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why..."
95962,L516163,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,They what? What? No. No. Why?
95963,L516162,u2837,m186,MECKLEN,"Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it..."
95964,L515854,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --"
95965,L515853,u2837,m186,MECKLEN,"-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --"
95966,L515852,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --"
95967,L515851,u2837,m186,MECKLEN,"And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --"
95968,L515850,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you."
95969,L515849,u2837,m186,MECKLEN,"Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --"
95970,L515847,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,"Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, ""no jail time for my guys."""
95971,L515846,u2837,m186,MECKLEN,"I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is."
95972,L515845,u2835,m186,ISRAEL,They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
95973,L516326,u2838,m186,MESSNER,No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
95974,L516325,u2836,m186,LOCKE,I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
95975,L516323,u2836,m186,LOCKE,I don't see it like that at all.
95976,L516322,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him..."
95977,L516321,u2836,m186,LOCKE,-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
95978,L516320,u2838,m186,MESSNER,...So you knew all this and yet y--
95979,L516319,u2836,m186,LOCKE,No... We're trying to save Heller.
95980,L516318,u2838,m186,MESSNER,You're trying to save Sparazza?
95981,L516316,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?"
95982,L516315,u2836,m186,LOCKE,I wouldn't go that far.
95983,L516314,u2838,m186,MESSNER,...So you made another deal?
95984,L516313,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove."
95985,L516310,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover."
95986,L516309,u2838,m186,MESSNER,...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
95987,L516308,u2836,m186,LOCKE,The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
95988,L516307,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"...Yeah, fifty-three."
95989,L516306,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure."
95990,L516305,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --"
95991,L516304,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"...Almost.  What do you mean ""who Sparazza actually was..."""
95992,L516303,u2836,m186,LOCKE,...Are you insane?
95993,L516301,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --"
95994,L516300,u2838,m186,MESSNER,...When did you know all this?
95995,L516299,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll."
95996,L516298,u2838,m186,MESSNER,So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
95997,L516297,u2836,m186,LOCKE,Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
95998,L516293,u2836,m186,LOCKE,...He does now...
95999,L516292,u2838,m186,MESSNER,...Does he know?
96000,L516291,u2836,m186,LOCKE,-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
96001,L516290,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"...A paternity suit, filed 1967..."
96002,L516288,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?"
96003,L516287,u2836,m186,LOCKE,You're finished.
96004,L516286,u2838,m186,MESSNER,-- You can and you will.
96005,L516285,u2836,m186,LOCKE,I can't discuss --
96006,L516282,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"-- no, we need to handle it now."
96007,L516281,u2836,m186,LOCKE,-- will be handled back in --
96008,L516280,u2838,m186,MESSNER,My debrief --
96009,L516279,u2836,m186,LOCKE,What are you doing here?
96010,L516278,u2838,m186,MESSNER,Where's Israel?
96011,L516234,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days."
96012,L516233,u2838,m186,MESSNER,What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
96013,L516231,u2836,m186,LOCKE,Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
96014,L516230,u2838,m186,MESSNER,This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
96015,L516229,u2836,m186,LOCKE,Here. Sit.   Please.
96016,L515659,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel."
96017,L515658,u2838,m186,MESSNER,It's the last place they'd look.
96018,L515621,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that..."
96019,L515620,u2838,m186,MESSNER,You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
96020,L515619,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished."
96021,L515604,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real."
96022,L515603,u2838,m186,MESSNER,"So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?"
96023,L515602,u2836,m186,LOCKE,His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
96024,L515601,u2838,m186,MESSNER,A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
96025,L515595,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks."
96026,L515594,u2838,m186,MESSNER,So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
96027,L515587,u2838,m186,MESSNER,I thought Heller was a double op?
96028,L515586,u2836,m186,LOCKE,"Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of ""The Turnpike Murders"" that was Sparazza."
96029,L515966,u2839,m186,PADICHE,It's gettin' done Sid.
96030,L515965,u2841,m186,SERNA,Bag this fucker Buzzy.
96031,L515964,u2839,m186,PADICHE,I'm working on it.
96032,L515963,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel."
96033,L515962,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya."
96034,L515958,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?"
96035,L515957,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --"
96036,L515956,u2839,m186,PADICHE,How are we on time...?
96037,L515955,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that."
96038,L515954,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing."
96039,L515952,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?"
96040,L515951,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?"
96041,L515950,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done."
96042,L515949,u2841,m186,SERNA,So how we lookin'?
96043,L515948,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Nah, nuthin' on my end --"
96044,L515947,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Right, you got clicks, anything?"
96045,L515946,u2839,m186,PADICHE,Yeah... Sid?
96046,L515945,u2841,m186,SERNA,Buzzy... Buzz...?
96047,L515574,u2841,m186,SERNA,None whatsoever.
96048,L515573,u2839,m186,PADICHE,No shit.
96049,L515572,u2841,m186,SERNA,A million flat.
96050,L515571,u2839,m186,PADICHE,Shoot.
96051,L515570,u2841,m186,SERNA,"That's the punchline, y'ready?"
96052,L515569,u2839,m186,PADICHE,Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
96053,L515568,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Yeah, I can front this."
96054,L515567,u2839,m186,PADICHE,That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
96055,L515566,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down."
96056,L515565,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this."
96057,L515564,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave."
96058,L515563,u2839,m186,PADICHE,Wow.
96059,L515562,u2841,m186,SERNA,"-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate."
96060,L515561,u2839,m186,PADICHE,... Jesus... what for?
96061,L515560,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ."
96062,L515559,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm."
96063,L515558,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?"
96064,L515557,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now."
96065,L515554,u2841,m186,SERNA,"So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a ""specialist"" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing."
96066,L515553,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"-- okay, g'head --"
96067,L515552,u2841,m186,SERNA,"-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --"
96068,L515551,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"-- he's doing it then, huh --"
96069,L515550,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --"
96070,L515549,u2839,m186,PADICHE,I'm here.
96071,L515548,u2841,m186,SERNA,"Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop."
96072,L515546,u2841,m186,SERNA,"-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --"
96073,L515545,u2839,m186,PADICHE,"Nah, nuthin' on my end --"

96099,L516153,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen..."
96100,L516152,u2843,m186,SYKES,Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
96101,L516109,u2844,m186,WATTERS,...What are they doin' right now...?
96102,L516108,u2843,m186,SYKES,"They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was."
96103,L516107,u2844,m186,WATTERS,What?
96104,L516106,u2843,m186,SYKES,"...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up..."
96105,L516103,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?"
96106,L516102,u2843,m186,SYKES,I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
96107,L516051,u2844,m186,WATTERS,Security's locking down the elevators.
96108,L516050,u2843,m186,SYKES,What's wrong?
96109,L516048,u2843,m186,SYKES,"-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now."
96110,L516047,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --"
96111,L516046,u2843,m186,SYKES,"No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --"
96112,L516045,u2844,m186,WATTERS,Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
96113,L516002,u2843,m186,SYKES,"Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm ""working girls."""
96114,L516001,u2844,m186,WATTERS,What'd you say?
96115,L515941,u2843,m186,SYKES,Fuck you.
96116,L515940,u2844,m186,WATTERS,I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
96117,L515939,u2843,m186,SYKES,"-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one."
96118,L515938,u2844,m186,WATTERS,Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
96119,L515937,u2843,m186,SYKES,Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
96120,L515936,u2844,m186,WATTERS,What!?
96121,L515935,u2843,m186,SYKES,"Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?"
96122,L515934,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need."
96123,L515933,u2843,m186,SYKES,"You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new."
96124,L515932,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide."
96125,L515931,u2843,m186,SYKES,I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
96126,L515930,u2844,m186,WATTERS,...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
96127,L515928,u2843,m186,SYKES,"Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer."
96128,L515927,u2844,m186,WATTERS,The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
96129,L515926,u2843,m186,SYKES,You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
96130,L515925,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through."
96131,L515924,u2843,m186,SYKES,"Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?"
96132,L515923,u2844,m186,WATTERS,I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
96133,L515922,u2843,m186,SYKES,"When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --"
96134,L515921,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'..."
96135,L515920,u2843,m186,SYKES,A Fed? Like FBI?
96136,L515919,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building."
96137,L515915,u2844,m186,WATTERS,"Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --"
96138,L515914,u2843,m186,SYKES,'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
96139,L515913,u2844,m186,WATTERS,Why?
96140,L515650,u2844,m186,WATTERS,What are we talkin' on the split...
96141,L515649,u2843,m186,SYKES,"We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass."
96142,L515653,u2845,m186,WYMAN,"Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool."
96143,L515652,u2843,m186,SYKES,What's the time frame?
96144,L515651,u2845,m186,WYMAN,"Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me."
96145,L515614,u2845,m186,WYMAN,"He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive."
96146,L515613,u2843,m186,SYKES,What else did Padiche say?
96147,L515612,u2845,m186,WYMAN,"No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel."
96148,L515611,u2843,m186,SYKES,"And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?"
96149,L515608,u2845,m186,WYMAN,"Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance ""show us your shit"" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya."
96150,L515607,u2843,m186,SYKES,Bulllllshit...
96151,L518527,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,"And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!"
96152,L518526,u2847,m187,KELVIN,A puppet.
96153,L518525,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,"No?  Who am I, then?"
96154,L518524,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You're not Gibarian...
96155,L518523,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,You'll end up like me.
96156,L518522,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I can trust Rheya.
96157,L518521,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
96158,L518520,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,"It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates."
96159,L518519,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Can it work?
96160,L518518,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,"You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth."
96161,L518517,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What do you want?
96162,L518516,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,"You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation."
96163,L518514,u2846,m187,GIBARIAN,Leave the light off.
96164,L518513,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Gibarian.
96165,L518668,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Yes.
96166,L518667,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
96167,L518666,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it."
96168,L518665,u2847,m187,KELVIN,How quickly?
96169,L518664,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
96170,L518663,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Whose side are you on?
96171,L518662,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You fucking bastard...
96172,L518661,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me."
96173,L518660,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Why would you let her to do that?
96174,L518659,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"No, she won't."
96175,L518658,u2847,m187,KELVIN,She'll come back.
96176,L518657,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone."
96177,L518656,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You murdered her!
96178,L518655,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Not her.  It.
96179,L518654,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You killed her!
96180,L518476,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Why did you agree to come here?
96181,L518475,u2847,m187,KELVIN,That's fantastic.
96182,L518474,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Yes.
96183,L518473,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
96184,L518375,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,She reappeared exactly as she had before?
96185,L518374,u2847,m187,KELVIN,No.  There's no behavior modification.
96186,L518236,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him."
96187,L518235,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Listen --
96188,L518234,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home."
96189,L518233,u2847,m187,KELVIN,They shouldn't let people like you into space.
96190,L518231,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Her?  Who are you talking about?
96191,L518230,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"In the lab.  With her, probably."
96192,L518229,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Where's his body?
96193,L518228,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,The same thing that could happen to any of us.
96194,L518227,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?"
96195,L518226,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?"
96196,L518225,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I want to hear your version.
96197,L518224,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Didn't you talk to Snow?
96198,L518223,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What happened to Gibarian?
96199,L518222,u2847,m187,KELVIN,All right.
96200,L518221,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
96201,L518681,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Maybe you can.
96202,L518680,u2850,m187,SNOW,But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
96203,L518679,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Jesus...
96204,L518678,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake."
96205,L518677,u2847,m187,KELVIN,When did this happen?
96206,L518672,u2850,m187,SNOW,I won't be making the trip.
96207,L518671,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
96208,L518624,u2850,m187,SNOW,"You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't."
96209,L518623,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I love her.
96210,L518622,u2850,m187,SNOW,"You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?"
96211,L518621,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Into what?
96212,L518620,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation."
96213,L518619,u2850,m187,SNOW,Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
96214,L518618,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Her oxygen would have run out.
96215,L518617,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours..."
96216,L518616,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Yes.
96217,L518615,u2850,m187,SNOW,"What do you want to do, leave the station with her?"
96218,L518614,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Just get him to stop.
96219,L518613,u2850,m187,SNOW,What plan?
96220,L518612,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
96221,L518611,u2850,m187,SNOW,What do you want?
96222,L518610,u2847,m187,KELVIN,No.
96223,L518609,u2850,m187,SNOW,She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
96224,L518608,u2847,m187,KELVIN,She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
96225,L518549,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?"
96226,L518548,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Get out --
96227,L518547,u2850,m187,SNOW,Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
96228,L518544,u2847,m187,KELVIN,She drank liquid oxygen.
96229,L518543,u2850,m187,SNOW,What happened?
96230,L518501,u2850,m187,SNOW,"That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually."
96231,L518500,u2847,m187,KELVIN,They come when you sleep.
96232,L518499,u2850,m187,SNOW,"But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience."
96233,L518498,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Human beings can die.
96234,L518497,u2850,m187,SNOW,Perhaps it did.
96235,L518496,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine."
96236,L518495,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it."
96237,L518494,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
96238,L518493,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement."
96239,L518492,u2847,m187,KELVIN,No.
96240,L518491,u2850,m187,SNOW,We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
96241,L518418,u2850,m187,SNOW,Who are you trying to convince?
96242,L518417,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody."
96243,L518416,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up."
96244,L518415,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Not necessarily.
96245,L518414,u2850,m187,SNOW,"If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?"
96246,L518413,u2847,m187,KELVIN,-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
96247,L518412,u2850,m187,SNOW,"You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --"
96248,L518383,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?"
96249,L518382,u2850,m187,SNOW,I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
96250,L518381,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so."
96251,L518354,u2850,m187,SNOW,Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
96252,L518353,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Why?
96253,L518352,u2850,m187,SNOW,Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
96254,L518351,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What is it?
96255,L518350,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Kelvin, you awake?"
96256,L518296,u2850,m187,SNOW,"That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?"
96257,L518295,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
96258,L518294,u2850,m187,SNOW,An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
96259,L518293,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I don't know.
96260,L518292,u2850,m187,SNOW,What are you going to report back to Earth?
96261,L518291,u2847,m187,KELVIN,To who?
96262,L518290,u2850,m187,SNOW,What will you say?
96263,L518289,u2850,m187,SNOW,Told you what?
96264,L518288,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I wish you'd told me.
96265,L518287,u2850,m187,SNOW,Probably.
96266,L518286,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Will she come back?
96267,L518285,u2850,m187,SNOW,It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
96268,L518284,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Rheya.
96269,L518283,u2850,m187,SNOW,She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
96270,L518282,u2850,m187,SNOW,Dead?
96271,L518281,u2847,m187,KELVIN,My wife.
96272,L518280,u2850,m187,SNOW,"I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?"
96273,L518279,u2847,m187,KELVIN,And professionally?
96274,L518278,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition."
96275,L518277,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What was it?
96276,L518276,u2850,m187,SNOW,"I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch."
96277,L518275,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Shut up.
96278,L518274,u2850,m187,SNOW,Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
96279,L518249,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door."
96280,L518248,u2847,m187,KELVIN,That depends.
96281,L518247,u2850,m187,SNOW,How long can you go without sleep?
96282,L518246,u2847,m187,KELVIN,How much sleep?
96283,L518245,u2850,m187,SNOW,How much sleep do you need?
96284,L518243,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Oh, that's a relief."
96285,L518242,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
96286,L518241,u2847,m187,KELVIN,She was real.  Where did she come from?
96287,L518240,u2850,m187,SNOW,Who was it?
96288,L518239,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
96289,L518238,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Why, who did you see?"
96290,L518237,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Is there anybody else here?
96291,L518218,u2850,m187,SNOW,"Kelvin, if you see anything unusual..."
96292,L518217,u2847,m187,KELVIN,He'll let me in.
96293,L518216,u2850,m187,SNOW,In his lab.  He won't let you in.
96294,L518215,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Where's Sartorius?
96295,L518214,u2850,m187,SNOW,I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
96296,L518212,u2850,m187,SNOW,"I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it."
96297,L518211,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What?
96298,L518210,u2850,m187,SNOW,"You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?"
96299,L518208,u2847,m187,KELVIN,How?
96300,L518207,u2850,m187,SNOW,He's dead.
96301,L518206,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
96302,L518690,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
96303,L518689,u2847,m187,KELVIN,How can you be here...
96304,L518640,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You must have been dreaming.
96305,L518639,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
96306,L518638,u2848,m187,RHEYA,When?
96307,L518637,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Where did you go before?
96308,L518634,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Please.  Don't.
96309,L518633,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have ""an arrangement"".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?"
96310,L518629,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
96311,L518628,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What does it want?
96312,L518627,u2847,m187,KELVIN,A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
96313,L518626,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What are you taking?
96314,L518606,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
96315,L518605,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Am I really her?
96316,L518604,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me."
96317,L518603,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I can't --
96318,L518602,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --"
96319,L518601,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?"
96320,L518600,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I think they help.
96321,L518599,u2848,m187,RHEYA,They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
96322,L518598,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I wish you wouldn't.
96323,L518597,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I want to stop taking those pills.
96324,L518596,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Is that really what you want?
96325,L518595,u2848,m187,RHEYA,But then I would be dead now.
96326,L518594,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
96327,L518593,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?"
96328,L518592,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Yes, you are --"
96329,L518591,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
96330,L518590,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Who are you, then?"
96331,L518589,u2848,m187,RHEYA,That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
96332,L518588,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You exist here.  I keep telling you.
96333,L518587,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You're lying.
96334,L518586,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I want you here.
96335,L518585,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What do I have to do to stop it?
96336,L518579,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Then you won't make it.
96337,L518578,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it."
96338,L518577,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I can't stay here.
96339,L518576,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Chris --
96340,L518575,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I never said I didn't.
96341,L518574,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You never said you wanted one.
96342,L518573,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Neither did I.
96343,L518572,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this."
96344,L518571,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Thank you.
96345,L518570,u2848,m187,RHEYA,It wouldn't have made any difference.
96346,L518569,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You should have told me.
96347,L518568,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
96348,L518562,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I want every second I can get with you.
96349,L518561,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Then you'll die.
96350,L518560,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you."
96351,L518559,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You're lying.  I'm not human.
96352,L518558,u2847,m187,KELVIN,No.
96353,L518557,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I'm disgusting.
96354,L518556,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya."
96355,L518555,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Don't call me that.
96356,L518554,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Rheya --
96357,L518553,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
96358,L518542,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
96359,L518541,u2848,m187,RHEYA,How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
96360,L518540,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no ""You"" from before."
96361,L518539,u2847,m187,KELVIN,That won't happen again.  We're different.
96362,L518538,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive."
96363,L518537,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I love you.
96364,L518536,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it."
96365,L518535,u2847,m187,KELVIN,It's all right.
96366,L518534,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What's happening to us?
96367,L518531,u2847,m187,KELVIN,He is.  But he was here...
96368,L518530,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You said he was dead.
96369,L518529,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Gibarian.  He was here.
96370,L518528,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What's wrong?
96371,L518512,u2848,m187,RHEYA,If you're here.
96372,L518511,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Do you?
96373,L518510,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Do you want to stay here?
96374,L518509,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Not this time.
96375,L518508,u2848,m187,RHEYA,But that's what happened before.
96376,L518507,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us."
96377,L518506,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it."
96378,L518505,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now."
96379,L518504,u2848,m187,RHEYA,That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
96380,L518503,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Rheya.
96381,L518502,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You don't want me.
96382,L518481,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do."
96383,L518480,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
96384,L518479,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You're the coward.
96385,L518470,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Those are dreams.
96386,L518469,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
96387,L518468,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Can you sleep?
96388,L518467,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"I love you, too."
96389,L518466,u2847,m187,KELVIN,No.  I love you.
96390,L518465,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Was she right?
96391,L518464,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You... she said I didn't love her.
96392,L518463,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Why did she do it?
96393,L518462,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Yes.  Especially toward the end.
96394,L518461,u2848,m187,RHEYA,But we fought.
96395,L518458,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
96396,L518457,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are."
96397,L518456,u2847,m187,KELVIN,When?  When I'm asleep?
96398,L518455,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Sartorius.
96399,L518454,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Who have you been talking to?
96400,L518453,u2848,m187,RHEYA,That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
96401,L518452,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What are you talking about?
96402,L518449,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Stop.
96403,L518448,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You don't love me.
96404,L518447,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What's wrong.
96405,L518443,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I'm glad.
96406,L518442,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Yes.  Yes.
96407,L518441,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Do I really feel like... I am...?
96408,L518440,u2848,m187,RHEYA,It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
96409,L518439,u2847,m187,KELVIN,It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
96410,L518438,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?"
96411,L518437,u2847,m187,KELVIN,He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
96412,L518436,u2848,m187,RHEYA,He has a point.
96413,L518435,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God."
96414,L518434,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Sartorius wants to destroy it.
96415,L518433,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home."
96416,L518432,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What does Snow think you should do?
96417,L518430,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
96418,L518429,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"You sure say ""God"" a lot when we're doing it."
96419,L518426,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day."
96420,L518425,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible."
96421,L518424,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I like that too.
96422,L518423,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
96423,L518422,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I think so.
96424,L518421,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
96425,L518411,u2847,m187,KELVIN,It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
96426,L518410,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
96427,L518407,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
96428,L518406,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Why did you say those things?
96429,L518402,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You don't know?
96430,L518401,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"What happened to us, exactly?"
96431,L518398,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I did too.
96432,L518397,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling."
96433,L518395,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
96434,L518394,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --"
96435,L518393,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What kind of look?
96436,L518392,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face."
96437,L518391,u2847,m187,KELVIN,How old were you?
96438,L518390,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff."
96439,L518388,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I been thinking about how much I hate you.
96440,L518387,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Where've you been?
96441,L518359,u2848,m187,RHEYA,When I saw you were gone I got scared.
96442,L518358,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
96443,L518357,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What happened?
96444,L518348,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"As I said, then it's God, right?"
96445,L518347,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"As I said, it is beyond our comprehension."
96446,L518346,u2848,m187,RHEYA,But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
96447,L518345,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?"
96448,L518344,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?"
96449,L518343,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!"
96450,L518342,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You still don't believe in God?
96451,L518341,u2847,m187,KELVIN,It's something.
96452,L518340,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Then it's God, right?"
96453,L518339,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
96454,L518338,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Is it intelligent?
96455,L518337,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything."
96456,L518336,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Is it a planet?
96457,L518335,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up."
96458,L518334,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?"
96459,L518333,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What do you mean?
96460,L518332,u2847,m187,KELVIN,What do you remember?
96461,L518330,u2847,m187,KELVIN,All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
96462,L518329,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better."
96463,L518328,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You're better when you take them.
96464,L518326,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You talk like an actor.
96465,L518325,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
96466,L518324,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You go home.
96467,L518323,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Let's go home.
96468,L518322,u2848,m187,RHEYA,"And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?"
96469,L518321,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Rheya.  Not here.
96470,L518320,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You behave as though you want to fuck her.
96471,L518319,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Stop it.
96472,L518318,u2848,m187,RHEYA,You want to fuck her?
96473,L518316,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Better.
96474,L518315,u2847,m187,KELVIN,And tonight?
96475,L518314,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I wasn't.
96476,L518313,u2847,m187,KELVIN,You didn't look very happy.
96477,L518312,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Not a very happy poem.
96478,L518311,u2848,m187,RHEYA,My Thomas is a little rusty.
96479,L518310,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
96480,L518309,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Book?
96481,L518308,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"""And Death Shall Have No Dominion""."
96482,L518307,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I want you inside me right now.
96483,L518306,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Rheya...
96484,L518272,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Yes.
96485,L518271,u2848,m187,RHEYA,We're taking a flight?
96486,L518270,u2848,m187,RHEYA,To calm my anxiety.
96487,L518269,u2847,m187,KELVIN,To calm your anxiety.
96488,L518268,u2848,m187,RHEYA,What are they?
96489,L518266,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I'll be right back.
96490,L518265,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I don't know.  I can't be alone.
96491,L518264,u2847,m187,KELVIN,Why?
96492,L518263,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Don't.
96493,L518262,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I'll just be a minute.
96494,L518261,u2848,m187,RHEYA,I'll go with you.
96495,L518260,u2847,m187,KELVIN,I need to see Snow.
96496,L518253,u2848,m187,RHEYA,Yes.
96497,L518252,u2847,m187,KELVIN,"Oh, God.  I'm awake."
96498,L518683,u2850,m187,SNOW,You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
96499,L518682,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,You want it coming back with us?
96500,L518676,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Fuck me.  I knew it.
96501,L518675,u2850,m187,SNOW,I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
96502,L518674,u2850,m187,SNOW,I'm not Snow.
96503,L518673,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"Snow, get up here, now."
96504,L518472,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here."
96505,L518471,u2850,m187,SNOW,Gibarian was under enormous --
96506,L518380,u2850,m187,SNOW,Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
96507,L518379,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Followed by non-human manifestations.
96508,L518378,u2850,m187,SNOW,"And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness."
96509,L518377,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"A recoil, with no compensating mechanism."
96510,L518373,u2850,m187,SNOW,It's an experiment.
96511,L518372,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,"They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual."
96512,L518368,u2850,m187,SNOW,We want to talk freely.
96513,L518367,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
96514,L518365,u2850,m187,SNOW,He won't.
96515,L518364,u2849,m187,SARTORIUS,Why do you say that?
96516,L518363,u2850,m187,SNOW,He won't do it.
96517,L522001,u2862,m188,WIN,"Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek."
96518,L522000,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Occasionally.
96519,L521999,u2862,m188,WIN,You still writing the occasional magazine article?
96520,L521998,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,It's terrific Win.
96521,L521996,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"It's called ""solid""... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win."
96522,L521995,u2862,m188,WIN,Looks a little constipated to me.
96523,L521994,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You didn't like him?
96524,L521993,u2862,m188,WIN,And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
96525,L521992,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
96526,L521991,u2862,m188,WIN,Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
96527,L521985,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Hello, Win."
96528,L521984,u2862,m188,WIN,Claire!
96529,L522662,u2856,m188,MIKE,You take care.
96530,L522661,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Say goodbye, Mike."
96531,L522660,u2856,m188,MIKE,I do.
96532,L522659,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
96533,L522658,u2856,m188,MIKE,I like your coat.
96534,L522656,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Listen, I'll... see you again."
96535,L522655,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I'll miss you, Mike."
96536,L522653,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I think it's probably still a good idea.
96537,L522652,u2856,m188,MIKE,"You don't have to, now."
96538,L522651,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I don't know...
96539,L522650,u2856,m188,MIKE,You still going away?
96540,L522649,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,So.
96541,L522648,u2856,m188,MIKE,So.
96542,L522647,u2856,m188,MIKE,Yeah.  It's all over.
96543,L522646,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Everyone's all right...?
96544,L522615,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Mike...?
96545,L522614,u2856,m188,MIKE,Claire!
96546,L522583,u2856,m188,MIKE,"It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy."
96547,L522582,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,... Mike.
96548,L522569,u2856,m188,MIKE,Yeah...
96549,L522568,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
96550,L522567,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"""To""... Forget about you."
96551,L522566,u2856,m188,MIKE,"""For""...?"
96552,L522565,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Long enough.
96553,L522564,u2856,m188,MIKE,How long you going away for?
96554,L522563,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,... Don't explain.
96555,L522562,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'd miss my life...
96556,L522561,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I know.
96557,L522560,u2856,m188,MIKE,It wouldn't work.
96558,L522559,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I know.
96559,L522558,u2856,m188,MIKE,I've been doing a lot of thinking.
96560,L522557,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Yeah.
96561,L522556,u2856,m188,MIKE,They guys treatin' you all right?
96562,L522555,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Let's do it.
96563,L522554,u2856,m188,MIKE,Pretty bad.
96564,L522553,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Do you?
96565,L522552,u2856,m188,MIKE,Do you dance?
96566,L522551,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,What a memory.
96567,L522517,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'll think about Wednesday.
96568,L522516,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really."
96569,L522515,u2856,m188,MIKE,Claire...
96570,L522514,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?"
96571,L522513,u2856,m188,MIKE,I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
96572,L522512,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
96573,L522511,u2856,m188,MIKE,Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
96574,L522510,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
96575,L522509,u2856,m188,MIKE,When can I see you?
96576,L522508,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found."
96577,L522507,u2856,m188,MIKE,Where?
96578,L522506,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I'm going away after that, the next morning."
96579,L522505,u2856,m188,MIKE,Oh that thing in Queens.
96580,L522504,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come..."
96581,L522503,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular ""marching band"".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --"
96582,L522502,u2856,m188,MIKE,Are you okay?
96583,L522501,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Oh God, that's great!"
96584,L522500,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through."
96585,L522499,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct."
96586,L522498,u2856,m188,MIKE,You don't want to know.
96587,L522469,u2856,m188,MIKE,I don't know.
96588,L522468,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,What do you want to do?
96589,L522467,u2856,m188,MIKE,Not exactly.
96590,L522466,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You told her?
96591,L522421,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it."
96592,L522420,u2856,m188,MIKE,You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
96593,L522419,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else..."
96594,L522418,u2856,m188,MIKE,I don't know you...
96595,L522417,u2856,m188,MIKE,She's okay.  Everything's okay...
96596,L522416,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,They called here after you left...
96597,L522415,u2856,m188,MIKE,Yeah.
96598,L522393,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
96599,L522392,u2856,m188,MIKE,I do care about you!
96600,L522391,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
96601,L522390,u2856,m188,MIKE,Stop being nuts!
96602,L522389,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Let go!
96603,L522388,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Stop, will you?!"
96604,L522387,u2856,m188,MIKE,Claire...!
96605,L522386,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park."
96606,L522385,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Claire, will you calm down?"
96607,L522384,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
96608,L522380,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!"
96609,L522379,u2856,m188,MIKE,"No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again..."
96610,L522378,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You put me life in danger.
96611,L522377,u2856,m188,MIKE,It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
96612,L522376,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I can't open it.
96613,L522375,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Open the door, will you?"
96614,L522374,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,What do you want?
96615,L522373,u2856,m188,MIKE,Claire?
96616,L522329,u2856,m188,MIKE,Sleep good.
96617,L522328,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Good night, Mike."
96618,L522326,u2856,m188,MIKE,Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
96619,L522325,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"It was nice having you ""watch over me""..."
96620,L522324,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I'll miss you, Mike..."
96621,L522323,u2856,m188,MIKE,You could do better.
96622,L522322,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best."
96623,L522321,u2856,m188,MIKE,You asked.
96624,L522320,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Tell it like it is.
96625,L522319,u2856,m188,MIKE,What's to like?
96626,L522318,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"You don't like him, do you?"
96627,L522317,u2856,m188,MIKE,What about Neil?
96628,L522316,u2856,m188,MIKE,Very nice.
96629,L522315,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"But ""nice""."
96630,L522314,u2856,m188,MIKE,No dog.
96631,L522313,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I saw you with a dog, in my mind."
96632,L522312,u2856,m188,MIKE,No dog.
96633,L522311,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?"
96634,L522310,u2856,m188,MIKE,Yeah.
96635,L522309,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"And ""is""...?"
96636,L522308,u2856,m188,MIKE,Yeah.  It was.
96637,L522307,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"So it was ""love""."
96638,L522306,u2856,m188,MIKE,"... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act..."
96639,L522305,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
96640,L522304,u2856,m188,MIKE,Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
96641,L522303,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!"
96642,L522302,u2856,m188,MIKE,"No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out."
96643,L522301,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
96644,L522300,u2856,m188,MIKE,Absolutely.  Look at this.
96645,L522299,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?"
96646,L522298,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow."
96647,L522297,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail..."
96648,L522296,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Could be, I guess."
96649,L522295,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"So, this could be your last night, huh?"
96650,L522294,u2856,m188,MIKE,No kidding.
96651,L522293,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
96652,L522292,u2856,m188,MIKE,They're kind of fuzzy.
96653,L522291,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
96654,L522290,u2856,m188,MIKE,How did you know?
96655,L522289,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You were reading my Renoir.
96656,L522288,u2856,m188,MIKE,Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
96657,L522287,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Didn't do very well, did you?"
96658,L522286,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Yeah, what a woman."
96659,L522285,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Urdu and Hindi.
96660,L522284,u2856,m188,MIKE,"You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?"
96661,L522283,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Hmm...
96662,L522282,u2856,m188,MIKE,Claire?
96663,L522280,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
96664,L522279,u2856,m188,MIKE,Big talk... Desperate guy.
96665,L522278,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,He said he'd kill me.
96666,L522277,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Sooner, the better."
96667,L522276,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
96668,L522274,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail."
96669,L522273,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the ""can"" the way he did."
96670,L522272,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Listen, that was my fault."
96671,L522271,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'm sorry about what happened.
96672,L522270,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Yeah.
96673,L522269,u2856,m188,MIKE,You all right?
96674,L522268,u2856,m188,MIKE,I came on at 8:00.
96675,L522267,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
96676,L522213,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I think I can probably do that on my own.
96677,L522212,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'll come with you.
96678,L522211,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee."
96679,L522210,u2856,m188,MIKE,Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
96680,L522209,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Let's get a drink.
96681,L522208,u2856,m188,MIKE,Hey!  There are crazy people here.
96682,L522207,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
96683,L522187,u2856,m188,MIKE,Not too sure about that.
96684,L522186,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"You can touch me, I won't bite."
96685,L522178,u2856,m188,MIKE,I got money.
96686,L522177,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Put it on my account, please."
96687,L522175,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie."
96688,L522174,u2856,m188,MIKE,Beg pardon?
96689,L522173,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Would you pick one out, please?"
96690,L522170,u2856,m188,MIKE,"No, Ma'am."
96691,L522169,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Are you nervous?
96692,L522164,u2856,m188,MIKE,Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
96693,L522163,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
96694,L522162,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
96695,L522161,u2856,m188,MIKE,Queens... You know Queens?
96696,L522160,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,You live in Manhattan?
96697,L522159,u2856,m188,MIKE,He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
96698,L522158,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,What did he say?
96699,L522155,u2856,m188,MIKE,Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
96700,L522154,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
96701,L522153,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,There's a phone in the car.
96702,L522152,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'm supposed to call in.
96703,L522151,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Can we go then?
96704,L522150,u2856,m188,MIKE,Right.  That's true.
96705,L522149,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?"
96706,L522148,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea..."
96707,L522147,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away."
96708,L522146,u2856,m188,MIKE,Uh...
96709,L522145,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
96710,L522144,u2856,m188,MIKE,Hi.
96711,L522112,u2856,m188,MIKE,Hard to find doors in this place.
96712,L522111,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Straight ahead.
96713,L522051,u2856,m188,MIKE,It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
96714,L522050,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,I've never seen anyone killed before.
96715,L522549,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Just putting in an appearance then.
96716,L522548,u2854,m188,GIDDINGS,"Well, of course, we'd be... honored..."
96717,L522547,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,Not if you don't want me to.
96718,L522546,u2854,m188,GIDDINGS,You're planning to speak?
96719,L522545,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,It was something my father always liked me to do.
96720,L522544,u2854,m188,GIDDINGS,"Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came."
96721,L522123,u2857,m188,NEIL,Claire...
96722,L522122,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- ""let it go away""!!"
96723,L522121,u2857,m188,NEIL,"You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life..."
96724,L522120,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,And I'm making mine.
96725,L522119,u2857,m188,NEIL,"Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --"
96726,L522118,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
96727,L522117,u2857,m188,NEIL,Claire...
96728,L522116,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,"... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial..."
96729,L522115,u2851,m188,CLAIRE,... I don't want to talk about it...
96730,L522114,u2857,m188,NEIL,... just saying you should think twice about it...
96731,L522641,u2860,m188,TOMMY,I'm all right.
96732,L522640,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Tommy...!
96733,L522543,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Absolutely.
96734,L522542,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"Hey, can we go to McDonald's?"
96735,L522541,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I don't know Tommy.
96736,L522540,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?"
96737,L522370,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"Sure we are, let's go!"
96738,L522369,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"We're not going to the game, are we Mom?"
96739,L522082,u2860,m188,TOMMY,The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
96740,L522081,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Nothing.
96741,L522080,u2860,m188,TOMMY,Keep what handy?
96742,L522667,u2856,m188,MIKE,Me neither.
96743,L522666,u2852,m188,ELLIE,He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
96744,L522643,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I'm all right.
96745,L522642,u2856,m188,MIKE,Ellie...
96746,L522488,u2856,m188,MIKE,No.
96747,L522487,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
96748,L522486,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?"
96749,L522485,u2856,m188,MIKE,What about Tommy?
96750,L522484,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
96751,L522451,u2856,m188,MIKE,El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
96752,L522450,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me."
96753,L522449,u2856,m188,MIKE,Let me drive...
96754,L522441,u2852,m188,ELLIE,What's the difference?
96755,L522440,u2856,m188,MIKE,My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
96756,L522439,u2856,m188,MIKE,You talked to his wife?
96757,L522438,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him..."
96758,L522437,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it."
96759,L522436,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift."
96760,L522435,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon."
96761,L522434,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you..."
96762,L522432,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me."
96763,L522431,u2856,m188,MIKE,What did you watch?
96764,L522430,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I watched TV.
96765,L522429,u2856,m188,MIKE,What did you do tonight?
96766,L522428,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I'm not saying it's your fault.
96767,L522427,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'm sorry.
96768,L522426,u2852,m188,ELLIE,You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
96769,L522412,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!"
96770,L522411,u2856,m188,MIKE,What're you talking about --
96771,L522410,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap."
96772,L522409,u2856,m188,MIKE,You heard me.
96773,L522408,u2852,m188,ELLIE,What was that?
96774,L522407,u2856,m188,MIKE,"D'you have to say ""fucking"" every other word?"
96775,L522406,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?"
96776,L522404,u2856,m188,MIKE,I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
96777,L522403,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
96778,L522367,u2856,m188,MIKE,Did you hear what I said?!!
96779,L522366,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Did you hear what I said?
96780,L522365,u2856,m188,MIKE,It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
96781,L522364,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case."
96782,L522363,u2856,m188,MIKE,Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
96783,L522362,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"Mike, take it easy..."
96784,L522361,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law."
96785,L522360,u2852,m188,ELLIE,What?
96786,L522348,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'll be right up.
96787,L522347,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
96788,L522346,u2856,m188,MIKE,Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
96789,L522345,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Coming to bed?
96790,L522264,u2856,m188,MIKE,I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
96791,L522263,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Why?
96792,L522262,u2856,m188,MIKE,She bought it.
96793,L522261,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
96794,L522260,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit..."
96795,L522259,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
96796,L522258,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Ellie, it was a formal party..."
96797,L522257,u2852,m188,ELLIE,What's wrong with your paisley tie?
96798,L522256,u2856,m188,MIKE,I had to follow her to a store.
96799,L522255,u2852,m188,ELLIE,She took you shopping for a tie?
96800,L522254,u2856,m188,MIKE,"She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one."
96801,L522253,u2856,m188,MIKE,What did she say the down payment was?
96802,L522252,u2852,m188,ELLIE,It's not your taste.
96803,L522251,u2856,m188,MIKE,Bought it.
96804,L522250,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Where'd you get the tie?
96805,L522249,u2856,m188,MIKE,No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
96806,L522248,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?"
96807,L522247,u2856,m188,MIKE,I might stop you.
96808,L522246,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I'd identify him.
96809,L522245,u2856,m188,MIKE,I think -- she's crazy.
96810,L522244,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
96811,L522243,u2856,m188,MIKE,Why?
96812,L522242,u2852,m188,ELLIE,She's got to identify him.
96813,L522241,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be."
96814,L522240,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Honey.  You got him.
96815,L522237,u2856,m188,MIKE,You don't want to hear about it.
96816,L522236,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"What shit, honey?"
96817,L522235,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Oh, some shit."
96818,L522234,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?"
96819,L522141,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
96820,L522140,u2856,m188,MIKE,Okay?
96821,L522137,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Well, actually, she looks better than that."
96822,L522136,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
96823,L522135,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Let 'em eat their hearts out.
96824,L522134,u2856,m188,MIKE,Hey.  The neighbors.
96825,L522132,u2852,m188,ELLIE,It's twenty bucks in the bank.
96826,L522131,u2856,m188,MIKE,I think television's a dangerous thing.
96827,L522130,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
96828,L522079,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Just keep it someplace safe, but handy."
96829,L522078,u2852,m188,ELLIE,I can still use a gun.
96830,L522077,u2856,m188,MIKE,Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
96831,L522074,u2856,m188,MIKE,'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
96832,L522073,u2852,m188,ELLIE,For how long?
96833,L522072,u2856,m188,MIKE,Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
96834,L522071,u2852,m188,ELLIE,So how'd it go?
96835,L521980,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
96836,L521979,u2856,m188,MIKE,You got no idea...
96837,L521978,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?"
96838,L521977,u2856,m188,MIKE,You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
96839,L521976,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity..."
96840,L521975,u2856,m188,MIKE,Get in bed.
96841,L521974,u2852,m188,ELLIE,"I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore."
96842,L521973,u2856,m188,MIKE,What are you talking about?
96843,L521972,u2852,m188,ELLIE,My ass is falling.  It is.
96844,L521971,u2856,m188,MIKE,Your what...?
96845,L521970,u2852,m188,ELLIE,My ass if falling.
96846,L521969,u2856,m188,MIKE,What?
96847,L521968,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Mike?
96848,L521967,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Take my advice, don't buy any..."
96849,L521966,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
96850,L521965,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now."
96851,L521964,u2852,m188,ELLIE,Too kinky.
96852,L521963,u2856,m188,MIKE,Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
96853,L522664,u2853,m188,GARBER,Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
96854,L522663,u2856,m188,MIKE,"What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this."
96855,L522481,u2856,m188,MIKE,It should've been me...
96856,L522480,u2853,m188,GARBER,"I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?"
96857,L522479,u2853,m188,GARBER,I heard.
96858,L522478,u2856,m188,MIKE,They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
96859,L522231,u2853,m188,GARBER,"If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him."
96860,L522230,u2856,m188,MIKE,What about when she identifies him?!
96861,L522229,u2853,m188,GARBER,"He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved ""good will"" by turning himself in."
96862,L522228,u2856,m188,MIKE,Even Joey Venza?!
96863,L522227,u2853,m188,GARBER,Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
96864,L522226,u2856,m188,MIKE,It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
96865,L522225,u2853,m188,GARBER,You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
96866,L522224,u2856,m188,MIKE,But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
96867,L522103,u2853,m188,GARBER,"Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out."
96868,L522102,u2856,m188,MIKE,What about when she goes out?
96869,L522062,u2853,m188,GARBER,"When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment."
96870,L522061,u2856,m188,MIKE,Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
96871,L522055,u2853,m188,GARBER,Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
96872,L522054,u2856,m188,MIKE,I just sat and listened.
96873,L522053,u2853,m188,GARBER,"I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it."
96874,L522591,u2855,m188,KOONTZ,"I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him."
96875,L522590,u2856,m188,MIKE,"No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!"
96876,L522587,u2856,m188,MIKE,"No, I need'm now!"
96877,L522586,u2855,m188,KOONTZ,We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
96878,L522585,u2856,m188,MIKE,Koontz!  I need you guys!
96879,L522584,u2855,m188,KOONTZ,Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
96880,L522581,u2855,m188,KOONTZ,Call a cruiser!
96881,L522580,u2856,m188,MIKE,At my house...!
96882,L522463,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I just gotta talk to her, T.J."
96883,L522462,u2859,m188,T.J.,Tell me I'm dreamin'.
96884,L522233,u2856,m188,MIKE,"It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!"
96885,L522232,u2859,m188,T.J.,Wasn't your fault.
96886,L522096,u2859,m188,T.J.,Be happy.  He's good at this.
96887,L522095,u2856,m188,MIKE,Not Koontz.
96888,L522066,u2859,m188,T.J.,Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
96889,L522065,u2856,m188,MIKE,You in this with me?
96890,L522064,u2859,m188,T.J.,"Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess."
96891,L522063,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all."
96892,L522028,u2859,m188,T.J.,Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
96893,L522027,u2856,m188,MIKE,Who's Joey Venza?
96894,L522022,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Right behind you, T.J."
96895,L522021,u2859,m188,T.J.,"Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?"
96896,L522204,u2858,m188,PRETTY YOUNG THING,"Erect.  You know, a ""boner?""  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man."
96897,L522203,u2856,m188,MIKE,... Hard?
96898,L522202,u2858,m188,PRETTY YOUNG THING,Does it make you... hard?
96899,L522201,u2856,m188,MIKE,Yes.
96900,L522200,u2858,m188,PRETTY YOUNG THING,Ever shot anyone?
96901,L522199,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman."
96902,L522127,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
96903,L522126,u2857,m188,NEIL,You're here 'til what time?
96904,L522045,u2857,m188,NEIL,I don't really see what that has to do with...
96905,L522044,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave."
96906,L522043,u2857,m188,NEIL,"No, I will not step outside."
96907,L522042,u2856,m188,MIKE,"She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please."
96908,L522041,u2857,m188,NEIL,You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
96909,L522039,u2856,m188,MIKE,Is she injured?
96910,L522038,u2857,m188,NEIL,"Don't tell me he's ""busy"".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and..."
96911,L522037,u2856,m188,MIKE,"That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs..."
96912,L522036,u2857,m188,NEIL,I asked for the man in charge...
96913,L522035,u2856,m188,MIKE,"No, sir..."
96914,L522034,u2857,m188,NEIL,Are you in charge here?
96915,L522635,u2861,m188,VENZA,What the fuck you doin'?!
96916,L522634,u2856,m188,MIKE,Watch your step!
96917,L522631,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head."
96918,L522630,u2861,m188,VENZA,Under the table.
96919,L522629,u2856,m188,MIKE,Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
96920,L522628,u2861,m188,VENZA,Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
96921,L522627,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!"
96922,L522626,u2861,m188,VENZA,I'm not lettin' no one go.
96923,L522625,u2856,m188,MIKE,Let my kid go.
96924,L522624,u2861,m188,VENZA,I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
96925,L522623,u2856,m188,MIKE,I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
96926,L522622,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!"
96927,L522621,u2861,m188,VENZA,Bullshit!  Prove it.
96928,L522620,u2856,m188,MIKE,She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
96929,L522619,u2861,m188,VENZA,Why should she come in?
96930,L522618,u2856,m188,MIKE,"I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in."
96931,L522617,u2861,m188,VENZA,How do I know that's her?
96932,L522613,u2856,m188,MIKE,I'll prove it!
96933,L522612,u2861,m188,VENZA,Hold it...!
96934,L522611,u2856,m188,MIKE,I brought the girl.  She's outside.
96935,L522610,u2861,m188,VENZA,You should'a brought the girl.
96936,L522609,u2856,m188,MIKE,"That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this."
96937,L522608,u2861,m188,VENZA,"You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said."
96938,L522538,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Take care, pal."
96939,L522537,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"I don't think she can sing, either."
96940,L522536,u2856,m188,MIKE,Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
96941,L522535,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad."
96942,L522534,u2856,m188,MIKE,Shooting?
96943,L522533,u2860,m188,TOMMY,Shooting.
96944,L522532,u2856,m188,MIKE,"So, what are you doing tonight?"
96945,L522531,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons."
96946,L522530,u2856,m188,MIKE,"No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a ""singing lesson"" than have dinner with your father..."
96947,L522529,u2860,m188,TOMMY,You coming in?
96948,L522528,u2860,m188,TOMMY,We're gonna pass the street.
96949,L522527,u2856,m188,MIKE,What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
96950,L522526,u2860,m188,TOMMY,She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
96951,L522525,u2856,m188,MIKE,She's what?
96952,L522524,u2860,m188,TOMMY,She's taking singing lessons.
96953,L522523,u2856,m188,MIKE,"What ""plans?""  You and Mom got ""plans?"""
96954,L522522,u2860,m188,TOMMY,Mom and I got plans.
96955,L522521,u2856,m188,MIKE,How about dinner tonight?
96956,L522520,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"Okay, I guess."
96957,L522519,u2856,m188,MIKE,"How are things going, pal?"
96958,L522143,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Yeah, I think so."
96959,L522142,u2860,m188,TOMMY,Nice threads Dad.
96960,L522090,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Just ""lay back, Mack""... lay back..."
96961,L522089,u2860,m188,TOMMY,God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
96962,L522087,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Lay back, Mack!!  What's this ""lay back, Mack?""  Where does he get this?"
96963,L522086,u2860,m188,TOMMY,"Lay back, Mack."
96964,L522085,u2856,m188,MIKE,"Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things."
96965,L522084,u2860,m188,TOMMY,I know where everything is.
96966,L522083,u2856,m188,MIKE,How do you know where the gun is?
96967,L522070,u2860,m188,TOMMY,Scrambled eggs surprise?
96968,L522069,u2856,m188,MIKE,"My special, scrambled eggs surprise."
96969,L522068,u2860,m188,TOMMY,What're we having?
96970,L530025,u2871,m189,LIZ,Let me see.
96971,L530024,u2863,m189,ADELE,Peter-- you took this picture?
96972,L530017,u2871,m189,LIZ,Be nice.
96973,L530016,u2863,m189,ADELE,And Flash isn't?
96974,L530011,u2863,m189,ADELE,At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
96975,L530010,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Well, look who's dressing for success."
96976,L529867,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way."
96977,L529866,u2863,m189,ADELE,Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
96978,L529862,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster..."
96979,L529861,u2863,m189,ADELE,Sexual tension...
96980,L529663,u2864,m189,BEN,"I'm always here, Pete."
96981,L529662,u2876,m189,PETER,I know.
96982,L529661,u2864,m189,BEN,"When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you."
96983,L529659,u2864,m189,BEN,"-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both..."
96984,L529658,u2876,m189,PETER,"Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--"
96985,L529657,u2864,m189,BEN,"Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--"
96986,L529656,u2876,m189,PETER,"No, no."
96987,L529655,u2864,m189,BEN,Cause if you get in a bind--
96988,L529654,u2876,m189,PETER,"Oh, sure."
96989,L529653,u2864,m189,BEN,"Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?"
96990,L529652,u2864,m189,BEN,"Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't."
96991,L529651,u2876,m189,PETER,Remember Little League?
96992,L529650,u2864,m189,BEN,"S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world."
96993,L529649,u2876,m189,PETER,Nonot really.
96994,L529648,u2864,m189,BEN,"Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?"
96995,L529647,u2864,m189,BEN,Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
96996,L529646,u2876,m189,PETER,I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
96997,L529645,u2864,m189,BEN,"Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline."
96998,L529644,u2876,m189,PETER,You stop him?
96999,L529643,u2864,m189,BEN,"Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day."
97000,L529642,u2876,m189,PETER,Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
97001,L529641,u2864,m189,BEN,"So, uh... how's college goin'?"
97002,L529640,u2876,m189,PETER,"No. No, that's okay."
97003,L529639,u2864,m189,BEN,"What, want a glass?"
97004,L529638,u2876,m189,PETER,"Uh, Uncle Ben, I--"
97005,L529637,u2864,m189,BEN,"Here you go, Pete."
97006,L530253,u2866,m189,HARRY,Or was it all a dream?
97007,L530252,u2865,m189,FLASH,See?
97008,L530251,u2866,m189,HARRY,I was there.
97009,L530021,u2865,m189,FLASH,-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
97010,L530020,u2866,m189,HARRY,"Flash, drop it--"
97011,L530019,u2865,m189,FLASH,"No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--"
97012,L530018,u2866,m189,HARRY,"Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded."
97013,L530194,u2865,m189,FLASH,"Come on, laughter's the best medicine!"
97014,L530193,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Flash, get lost."
97015,L530029,u2871,m189,LIZ,Hm.  What a lump.
97016,L530028,u2865,m189,FLASH,"Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!"
97017,L530015,u2871,m189,LIZ,I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
97018,L530014,u2865,m189,FLASH,"Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool."
97019,L529590,u2865,m189,FLASH,I'm parked illegally!
97020,L529589,u2871,m189,LIZ,I was sort of hoping to get out of--
97021,L529588,u2865,m189,FLASH,Lizzy!
97022,L530256,u2866,m189,HARRY,"Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo."
97023,L530255,u2876,m189,PETER,"Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself..."
97024,L530254,u2866,m189,HARRY,"Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed."
97025,L530188,u2866,m189,HARRY,I got you a present.
97026,L530187,u2876,m189,PETER,"Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--"
97027,L530186,u2866,m189,HARRY,You get mugged or something?
97028,L530009,u2876,m189,PETER,"You're not half the idiot I am, Harry."
97029,L530008,u2866,m189,HARRY,And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
97030,L530007,u2876,m189,PETER,Mm-hmm.
97031,L530006,u2866,m189,HARRY,Jesus Christ.
97032,L529813,u2866,m189,HARRY,I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
97033,L529812,u2876,m189,PETER,Don't be pitiful.
97034,L529811,u2866,m189,HARRY,You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
97035,L529810,u2866,m189,HARRY,"Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?"
97036,L529809,u2876,m189,PETER,Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
97037,L529808,u2866,m189,HARRY,"Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!"
97038,L529807,u2876,m189,PETER,I know.  I've got one too.
97039,L529806,u2866,m189,HARRY,"""Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."""
97040,L529805,u2876,m189,PETER,Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.

97042,L529803,u2876,m189,PETER,Harry
97043,L529802,u2866,m189,HARRY,Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
97044,L529561,u2876,m189,PETER,Harry!
97045,L529560,u2866,m189,HARRY,A little bunny I saved from dissection.
97046,L529559,u2876,m189,PETER,What's in there?
97047,L529558,u2866,m189,HARRY,They'll never take me alive.
97048,L529557,u2876,m189,PETER,You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
97049,L529755,u2876,m189,PETER,Right.
97050,L529754,u2867,m189,HOGAN,"You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy."
97051,L529753,u2876,m189,PETER,"Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--"
97052,L529752,u2867,m189,HOGAN,"How are you doing, kid?"
97053,L529748,u2867,m189,HOGAN,"Get away from me, freak!"
97054,L529747,u2876,m189,PETER,Are you okay?
97055,L529746,u2876,m189,PETER,That's not even close.
97056,L529745,u2867,m189,HOGAN,"Lemme down, bugface!"
97057,L529744,u2876,m189,PETER,Now tell me you love me.
97058,L529836,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"No!  Now get outta my face, kid."
97059,L529835,u2876,m189,PETER,Can I get a word in edgewise?
97060,L529834,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?"
97061,L529833,u2876,m189,PETER,Mr. Jameson--
97062,L529832,u2868,m189,JAMESON,Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
97063,L529831,u2876,m189,PETER,You print pictures of Bigfoot!
97064,L529830,u2868,m189,JAMESON,I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
97065,L529829,u2876,m189,PETER,Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
97066,L529828,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--"
97067,L529827,u2876,m189,PETER,Mr. Jameson--
97068,L529826,u2868,m189,JAMESON,I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
97069,L529825,u2876,m189,PETER,"Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--"
97070,L529824,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do."
97071,L529712,u2868,m189,JAMESON,Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
97072,L529711,u2876,m189,PETER,Can't focus...
97073,L529699,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff."
97074,L529698,u2876,m189,PETER,Can we make it a hundred?
97075,L529697,u2868,m189,JAMESON,Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
97076,L529696,u2876,m189,PETER,Yeah--
97077,L529695,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?"
97078,L529694,u2876,m189,PETER,"You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?"
97079,L529599,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--"
97080,L529598,u2876,m189,PETER,"Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--"
97081,L529595,u2876,m189,PETER,I think you're trying to tell me something.
97082,L529594,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid."
97083,L530125,u2868,m189,JAMESON,Hmf-hrr?
97084,L530124,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye."
97085,L530122,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Fine.
97086,L530121,u2868,m189,JAMESON,Frmpph-yrr.
97087,L530120,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that."
97088,L530119,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"Police, help!  Po-- mmph."
97089,L530118,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Would you cool it already?
97090,L530117,u2868,m189,JAMESON,"I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--"
97091,L530116,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--"
97092,L529766,u2876,m189,PETER,Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
97093,L529765,u2869,m189,LEIBER,An even five I throw in the jacket.
97094,L529764,u2876,m189,PETER,Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
97095,L529763,u2869,m189,LEIBER,You're making my life difficult.
97096,L529762,u2876,m189,PETER,How about tomorrow?
97097,L529761,u2869,m189,LEIBER,Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
97098,L529760,u2876,m189,PETER,A spider.  Eight legs.
97099,L529759,u2869,m189,LEIBER,What's this? A cockaroach?
97100,L529758,u2876,m189,PETER,"Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue."
97101,L529757,u2869,m189,LEIBER,"No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws."
97102,L529991,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength."
97103,L529990,u2870,m189,LETTERMAN,Are you quite finished?
97104,L529922,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength..."
97105,L529921,u2870,m189,LETTERMAN,"All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?"
97106,L529916,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Well...
97107,L529915,u2870,m189,LETTERMAN,"I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?"
97108,L529914,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Thanks, I already ate."
97109,L529913,u2870,m189,LETTERMAN,"Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?"
97110,L529912,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Just call me Spidey.
97111,L529911,u2870,m189,LETTERMAN,"I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--"
97112,L529910,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
97113,L529909,u2870,m189,LETTERMAN,"Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?"
97114,L530139,u2873,m189,MAY,What if the world ends tomorrow?
97115,L530138,u2871,m189,LIZ,What if you get hurt?
97116,L530137,u2873,m189,MAY,Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
97117,L530136,u2871,m189,LIZ,Even if they're not clever.
97118,L530135,u2873,m189,MAY,Some things you should say anyway.
97119,L530134,u2871,m189,LIZ,He knew.
97120,L530133,u2873,m189,MAY,"Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing."
97121,L530128,u2871,m189,LIZ,I don't think he wants me to find him.
97122,L530127,u2873,m189,MAY,"When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found."
97123,L530126,u2871,m189,LIZ,He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
97124,L530269,u2876,m189,PETER,Nah.
97125,L530268,u2871,m189,LIZ,"This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know."
97126,L530267,u2871,m189,LIZ,Why?
97127,L530266,u2876,m189,PETER,"Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?"
97128,L530265,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--"
97129,L530264,u2876,m189,PETER,I... I like you.  A lot.
97130,L530263,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?"
97131,L530262,u2876,m189,PETER,"Hello, Liz."
97132,L530203,u2876,m189,PETER,I'm here...
97133,L530202,u2871,m189,LIZ,Peter?
97134,L530201,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now."
97135,L530200,u2876,m189,PETER,Strong...
97136,L530199,u2871,m189,LIZ,Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
97137,L530198,u2876,m189,PETER,"Oh, God, I forgot to--"
97138,L530197,u2871,m189,LIZ,May's much better. She'll be out soon.
97139,L530196,u2871,m189,LIZ,Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
97140,L530195,u2876,m189,PETER,I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
97141,L530090,u2876,m189,PETER,Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
97142,L530089,u2871,m189,LIZ,Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
97143,L530087,u2871,m189,LIZ,I know what you mean.  I...
97144,L530086,u2876,m189,PETER,"Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore."
97145,L530085,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter."
97146,L530084,u2876,m189,PETER,You'd feel what?
97147,L530083,u2871,m189,LIZ,"So?  The next day I'd read, ""Peter Parker murdered,"" and I'd feel..."
97148,L530082,u2876,m189,PETER,"Well, no."
97149,L530081,u2871,m189,LIZ,"You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?"
97150,L530080,u2876,m189,PETER,They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
97151,L530079,u2876,m189,PETER,I think I'd like that.
97152,L530078,u2871,m189,LIZ,Do you mind if I come too?
97153,L530077,u2876,m189,PETER,-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
97154,L530073,u2876,m189,PETER,That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
97155,L530072,u2871,m189,LIZ,This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
97156,L530071,u2876,m189,PETER,"No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change."
97157,L530070,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Oh, don't do it on my account--"
97158,L530069,u2876,m189,PETER,Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
97159,L530068,u2871,m189,LIZ,What's in the bag?  Garbage?
97160,L529870,u2871,m189,LIZ,That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
97161,L529869,u2876,m189,PETER,This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
97162,L529868,u2871,m189,LIZ,Sit down and stop being such a child.
97163,L529865,u2876,m189,PETER,I've got no problems.
97164,L529864,u2871,m189,LIZ,What's your problem?
97165,L529863,u2876,m189,PETER,"Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them."
97166,L529860,u2876,m189,PETER,I'm sure you kept warm.
97167,L529859,u2871,m189,LIZ,Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
97168,L529858,u2876,m189,PETER,"Hi, Adele."
97169,L529857,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?"
97170,L529587,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Oh. Maybe I should, too--"
97171,L529586,u2876,m189,PETER,I've gotta study.
97172,L529585,u2871,m189,LIZ,What are you doing this weekend?
97173,L529584,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Hurry up, Flash!"
97174,L529583,u2876,m189,PETER,I'd never admit that.
97175,L529582,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like ""Flash."""
97176,L529581,u2876,m189,PETER,Does it have a human name?
97177,L529580,u2871,m189,LIZ,Some prep school thing.
97178,L529579,u2876,m189,PETER,"""Flash,"" Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself ""Flash."""
97179,L529578,u2871,m189,LIZ,You should write that one down.
97180,L529577,u2876,m189,PETER,But you like that in a man?
97181,L529576,u2871,m189,LIZ,"God, Flash can be such a jerk."
97182,L529575,u2876,m189,PETER,What?
97183,L529574,u2871,m189,LIZ,"You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad."
97184,L529573,u2876,m189,PETER,I suppose.
97185,L529572,u2871,m189,LIZ,Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
97186,L529571,u2876,m189,PETER,My my.
97187,L529570,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?"
97188,L529569,u2876,m189,PETER,"Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though."
97189,L529568,u2871,m189,LIZ,He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
97190,L529567,u2876,m189,PETER,Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
97191,L529566,u2871,m189,LIZ,Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
97192,L529565,u2876,m189,PETER,-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
97193,L529548,u2876,m189,PETER,Thank God.
97194,L529547,u2871,m189,LIZ,No.  I was lying about the coffee.
97195,L529544,u2871,m189,LIZ,"I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes."
97196,L529543,u2876,m189,PETER,I hate--
97197,L529542,u2871,m189,LIZ,I hate people with alliterative names.
97198,L529541,u2876,m189,PETER,I hate the Platonic idea of you.
97199,L529540,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you."
97200,L529539,u2876,m189,PETER,"I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--"
97201,L529538,u2871,m189,LIZ,Uh is a good start.
97202,L529537,u2876,m189,PETER,I-- uh--
97203,L529536,u2871,m189,LIZ,"Fill in the blank: ""I blank Elizabeth Allan."""
97204,L529535,u2876,m189,PETER,Huh?
97205,L529534,u2871,m189,LIZ,It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
97206,L529533,u2876,m189,PETER,It's too early to be clever.
97207,L529532,u2871,m189,LIZ,"How very dull, Peter Parker."
97208,L529531,u2876,m189,PETER,"Good morning, Liz."
97209,L530211,u2878,m189,ROZ,Precise equipment such as waldos
97210,L530210,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
97211,L530208,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
97212,L530207,u2878,m189,ROZ,Any sign of our friend?
97213,L530206,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,"Yeah, Roz."
97214,L530052,u2878,m189,ROZ,Peter-- my condolences.
97215,L530051,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,"Einstein, right?  We'll see ya."
97216,L530050,u2878,m189,ROZ,"No such thing as coincidence.  ""God does not play dice with the universe."""
97217,L530049,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,"It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?"
97218,L530048,u2878,m189,ROZ,Of course.
97219,L530046,u2878,m189,ROZ,I know him.
97220,L530045,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,You sure about all this?
97221,L530044,u2878,m189,ROZ,"And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--"
97222,L530043,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,"Toxic dumps, huh."
97223,L530042,u2878,m189,ROZ,"There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270."
97224,L530041,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,"Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--"
97225,L530040,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--"
97226,L530039,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
97227,L530038,u2878,m189,ROZ,Waldos.
97228,L530037,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,"But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--"
97229,L530036,u2878,m189,ROZ,Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
97230,L530035,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
97231,L530034,u2878,m189,ROZ,So you've found Thorkel?
97232,L530033,u2872,m189,MAROTTA,You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
97233,L529980,u2873,m189,MAY,"He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine."
97234,L529979,u2876,m189,PETER,How is he?
97235,L529978,u2873,m189,MAY,I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
97236,L529977,u2876,m189,PETER,"Aunt May, what happened?"
97237,L529976,u2873,m189,MAY,"Oh, Ben gets through everything."
97238,L529975,u2876,m189,PETER,It's fine.  Tell me what--
97239,L529974,u2873,m189,MAY,"Peter, you're bleeding."
97240,L529675,u2873,m189,MAY,See?  You big dullard.
97241,L529674,u2876,m189,PETER,A match made in heaven.
97242,L529671,u2873,m189,MAY,Use a fork.
97243,L529670,u2876,m189,PETER,Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
97244,L529669,u2873,m189,MAY,Absolutely no class.
97245,L529668,u2873,m189,MAY,You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
97246,L529667,u2876,m189,PETER,"Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it."
97247,L529665,u2873,m189,MAY,"Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't."
97248,L529664,u2876,m189,PETER,What the hell is that?
97249,L529620,u2873,m189,MAY,It'll shut itself off.
97250,L529619,u2876,m189,PETER,The record--
97251,L529618,u2876,m189,PETER,No.
97252,L529617,u2873,m189,MAY,Yes.  Do you have a date?
97253,L529616,u2876,m189,PETER,It's Friday night...
97254,L529615,u2873,m189,MAY,"Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--"
97255,L529614,u2876,m189,PETER,"I'm a photographer, remember?"
97256,L529613,u2873,m189,MAY,Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
97257,L529612,u2876,m189,PETER,I'll introduce you.
97258,L529611,u2873,m189,MAY,--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
97259,L529610,u2876,m189,PETER,I am old enough to--
97260,L529608,u2873,m189,MAY,"Oh, Peter. A zit."
97261,L529607,u2876,m189,PETER,"When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--"
97262,L529606,u2873,m189,MAY,Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
97263,L529605,u2876,m189,PETER,"Aunt May, you're trespassing."
97264,L529604,u2873,m189,MAY,That's the understatement of the year.
97265,L529603,u2876,m189,PETER,There's nothing in there worth stealing!
97266,L529719,u2876,m189,PETER,"Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--"
97267,L529718,u2874,m189,NURSE VOICE,Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
97268,L529717,u2876,m189,PETER,"I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--"
97269,L529716,u2874,m189,NURSE VOICE,Is this some sort of Zen thing?
97270,L529715,u2876,m189,PETER,Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
97271,L529714,u2874,m189,NURSE VOICE,Poison emergency.
97272,L529797,u2880,m189,THORKEL,Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
97273,L529796,u2875,m189,OCK,I will finish what I've begun
97274,L529795,u2880,m189,THORKEL,Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
97275,L529636,u2875,m189,OCK,No!
97276,L529635,u2880,m189,THORKEL,That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
97277,L529632,u2875,m189,OCK,I don't care.  Cretin.
97278,L529631,u2880,m189,THORKEL,You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
97279,L529630,u2875,m189,OCK,This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
97280,L529629,u2880,m189,THORKEL,What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
97281,L529628,u2875,m189,OCK,I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
97282,L529627,u2880,m189,THORKEL,Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
97283,L529626,u2880,m189,THORKEL,"I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures."
97284,L529625,u2875,m189,OCK,"In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--"
97285,L529624,u2880,m189,THORKEL,Let's talk in the hall.
97286,L529623,u2875,m189,OCK,Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
97287,L529622,u2880,m189,THORKEL,Power down.  I need to talk to you.
97288,L529621,u2875,m189,OCK,Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
97289,L530218,u2878,m189,ROZ,You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
97290,L530217,u2875,m189,OCK,Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
97291,L530216,u2878,m189,ROZ,"My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!"
97292,L529791,u2875,m189,OCK,"Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now."
97293,L529790,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--"
97294,L529789,u2878,m189,ROZ,No. It isn't.
97295,L529788,u2875,m189,OCK,I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
97296,L529787,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--"
97297,L529786,u2875,m189,OCK,"Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality."
97298,L529785,u2878,m189,ROZ,Creation? Or its opposite?
97299,L529784,u2875,m189,OCK,"You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation."
97300,L529783,u2878,m189,ROZ,"All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got."
97301,L529782,u2875,m189,OCK,"My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh."
97302,L529780,u2875,m189,OCK,"Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe."
97303,L529779,u2878,m189,ROZ,"A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--"
97304,L529682,u2875,m189,OCK,I left a paper in my desk.
97305,L529681,u2878,m189,ROZ,I heard about Thorkel's order--
97306,L529680,u2875,m189,OCK,No.  No thank you.  I have work.
97307,L529529,u2878,m189,ROZ,Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
97308,L529528,u2875,m189,OCK,"Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents."
97309,L529527,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point."
97310,L530260,u2878,m189,ROZ,"If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time."
97311,L530259,u2876,m189,PETER,Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
97312,L530258,u2878,m189,ROZ,"The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus."
97313,L530058,u2876,m189,PETER,I'll try. Thanks.
97314,L530057,u2878,m189,ROZ,You never know.  Go get some sleep.
97315,L530056,u2876,m189,PETER,I don't think I'll be running into him.
97316,L530055,u2878,m189,ROZ,Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
97317,L530054,u2876,m189,PETER,Luck.  The right place at the right time.
97318,L530053,u2878,m189,ROZ,"This photo you took of ""Spider-Man"" -"
97319,L529889,u2878,m189,ROZ,"No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems."
97320,L529888,u2876,m189,PETER,Need any more help?
97321,L529883,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang."
97322,L529882,u2876,m189,PETER,Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
97323,L529881,u2878,m189,ROZ,How much do you know about it?
97324,L529880,u2876,m189,PETER,Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
97325,L529879,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it."
97326,L529877,u2876,m189,PETER,"Really, Professor, I--"
97327,L529876,u2878,m189,ROZ,Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
97328,L529875,u2876,m189,PETER,"Actually, I got this spider bite"
97329,L529874,u2878,m189,ROZ,Your dog ate it.
97330,L529873,u2876,m189,PETER,"An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh..."
97331,L529872,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Peter, what can I do for you?"
97332,L529563,u2876,m189,PETER,"Hi, Professor.  What's up?"
97333,L529562,u2878,m189,ROZ,Mr. Parker.
97334,L529845,u2877,m189,REISS,"Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye."
97335,L529844,u2876,m189,PETER,"Why? It is a wrestling match, or"
97336,L529843,u2877,m189,REISS,Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
97337,L529842,u2876,m189,PETER,No
97338,L529841,u2877,m189,REISS,"I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?"
97339,L529840,u2876,m189,PETER,"Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?"
97340,L529750,u2876,m189,PETER,"Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--"
97341,L529749,u2877,m189,REISS,"Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?"
97342,L529931,u2877,m189,REISS,"I just gave-- yeah, sure."
97343,L529930,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
97344,L529929,u2877,m189,REISS,"Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow."
97345,L529928,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call."
97346,L529927,u2877,m189,REISS,I asked if you felt like a drink--
97347,L529926,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,What?
97348,L529925,u2877,m189,REISS,... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
97349,L529924,u2877,m189,REISS,"Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act."
97350,L529923,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,So they're airing this tonight?
97351,L529906,u2877,m189,REISS,Nah.  The big mask was better.
97352,L529905,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Like it?
97353,L529904,u2877,m189,REISS,Where'd you get the clown suit?
97354,L530241,u2878,m189,ROZ,"No, no!  Not there!"
97355,L530240,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Up here, Docky Ocky!"
97356,L530235,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--"
97357,L530234,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?"
97358,L530221,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,I'm not so happy myself.
97359,L530220,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad."
97360,L530176,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Phooey on that.

97362,L530174,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way."
97363,L530173,u2878,m189,ROZ,Do you... live around here?
97364,L530172,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Just drop me off here.
97365,L530171,u2878,m189,ROZ,Loonytunes.  And yet...
97366,L530170,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Bonkers.
97367,L530169,u2878,m189,ROZ,"I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- ""I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds.""  Octavius was..."
97368,L530168,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
97369,L530167,u2878,m189,ROZ,"A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely."
97370,L530166,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?"
97371,L530165,u2878,m189,ROZ,He'll try to finish his experiment.
97372,L530164,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
97373,L530163,u2878,m189,ROZ,"Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?"
97374,L530162,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Imagine how I feel.
97375,L530161,u2878,m189,ROZ,Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
97376,L530160,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,"Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did."
97377,L530159,u2878,m189,ROZ,You're sure you're all right.
97378,L530158,u2878,m189,ROZ,Right.  Let's go.
97379,L530157,u2879,m189,SPIDER-MAN,Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
97380,L530156,u2878,m189,ROZ,I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
97381,L533280,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,We did not.
97382,L533279,u2889,m190,HOFFY,You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
97383,L533278,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
97384,L533153,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Plenty.
97385,L533152,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,What's wrong with him?
97386,L533136,u2889,m190,HOFFY,They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
97387,L533135,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,They never caught on.
97388,L533134,u2889,m190,HOFFY,I wouldn't talk about things like that.
97389,L533133,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,"Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!"
97390,L533170,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
97391,L533169,u2891,m190,P.O.W.S,Jawohl!
97392,L533168,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,Is you all little Adolfs?
97393,L533167,u2891,m190,P.O.W.S,Jawohl.
97394,L533166,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,Is you all good Nazis?
97395,L533165,u2891,m190,P.O.W.S,Jawohl.
97396,L533474,u2892,m190,PRICE,Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
97397,L533473,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
97398,L533472,u2892,m190,PRICE,Don't worry. He'll be all right.
97399,L533471,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
97400,L533413,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,"Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?"
97401,L533412,u2892,m190,PRICE,What's the match gag?
97402,L533411,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,"Just pulled the old match gag, see!"
97403,L533410,u2892,m190,PRICE,Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
97404,L533409,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,"There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?"
97405,L533408,u2892,m190,PRICE,Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
97406,L533394,u2892,m190,PRICE,He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
97407,L533393,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,Any news on Dunbar?
97408,L533392,u2892,m190,PRICE,We made a deal with Barrack One.
97409,L533282,u2881,m190,BAGRADIAN,I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
97410,L533281,u2892,m190,PRICE,Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
97411,L533555,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Get going on the trap door.
97412,L533554,u2882,m190,BLONDIE,Coming up.
97413,L533553,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?"
97414,L533500,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Okay. Move on.
97415,L533499,u2882,m190,BLONDIE,Roger.
97416,L533498,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Ready?
97417,L532942,u2882,m190,BLONDIE,Static!
97418,L532941,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Come on!
97419,L532714,u2882,m190,BLONDIE,Looks good outside.
97420,L532713,u2889,m190,HOFFY,They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
97421,L533615,u2883,m190,COOKIE,"So long, Sefton."
97422,L533614,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it."
97423,L533470,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Yeah. Security.
97424,L533469,u2883,m190,COOKIE,"If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?"
97425,L533468,u2883,m190,COOKIE,Who is it?
97426,L533467,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?"
97427,L533466,u2883,m190,COOKIE,Who is it?
97428,L533465,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
97429,L533464,u2883,m190,COOKIE,In this barracks?
97430,L533463,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?"
97431,L533462,u2883,m190,COOKIE,I don't know anymore.
97432,L533461,u2894,m190,SEFTON,What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
97433,L533143,u2894,m190,SEFTON,We'll get some more.
97434,L533142,u2883,m190,COOKIE,There's only one pair left.
97435,L532735,u2894,m190,SEFTON,That'll do.
97436,L532734,u2883,m190,COOKIE,W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
97437,L533603,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Forget it.
97438,L533602,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Brother, were we all wet about you!"
97439,L533568,u2884,m190,DUKE,We're looking at it.
97440,L533567,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
97441,L533507,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?"
97442,L533506,u2884,m190,DUKE,"You ain't going to squeal this one, brother."
97443,L533505,u2894,m190,SEFTON,I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
97444,L533422,u2884,m190,DUKE,Thanks.
97445,L533421,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Have a cigar.
97446,L533400,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Why not?
97447,L533399,u2884,m190,DUKE,Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
97448,L533398,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Take it.
97449,L533397,u2884,m190,DUKE,"What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?"
97450,L533255,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four."
97451,L533254,u2884,m190,DUKE,You make my mouth water.
97452,L533253,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
97453,L533252,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it."
97454,L533039,u2894,m190,SEFTON,A little something what?
97455,L533038,u2884,m190,DUKE,And maybe a little something else?
97456,L533037,u2894,m190,SEFTON,I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
97457,L533034,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?"
97458,L533033,u2884,m190,DUKE,Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
97459,L533032,u2894,m190,SEFTON,That's right.
97460,L533031,u2884,m190,DUKE,I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
97461,L532944,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?"
97462,L532943,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!"
97463,L532901,u2884,m190,DUKE,"You stink, Sefton!"
97464,L532900,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog."
97465,L532899,u2884,m190,DUKE,"A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!"
97466,L532898,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator."
97467,L532895,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?"
97468,L532894,u2884,m190,DUKE,Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
97469,L532891,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
97470,L532890,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?"
97471,L532823,u2884,m190,DUKE,"How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?"
97472,L532822,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Private property, bub."
97473,L532748,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Anybody here wanna double their bet?
97474,L532747,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?"
97475,L532721,u2894,m190,SEFTON,No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
97476,L532720,u2884,m190,DUKE,Now what kind of a crack is that?
97477,L533537,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Everybody but Joey, and you know who."
97478,L533536,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Then we're all in on it?
97479,L533491,u2884,m190,DUKE,Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
97480,L533490,u2889,m190,HOFFY,The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
97481,L533229,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal."
97482,L533228,u2889,m190,HOFFY,How did he get over there?
97483,L533043,u2889,m190,HOFFY,There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
97484,L533042,u2884,m190,DUKE,How much more do we have to take from him?
97485,L533041,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Break it off!
97486,L532831,u2884,m190,DUKE,"You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!"
97487,L532830,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Come again?
97488,L532741,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Okay, Security -- what happened?"
97489,L532740,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
97490,L532730,u2884,m190,DUKE,I'll call the whole pot.
97491,L532729,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Put me down for ten, you louse."
97492,L532970,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,You are talking crazy!
97493,L532969,u2884,m190,DUKE,That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
97494,L532966,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Which one of you is what?
97495,L532965,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?"
97496,L532962,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Tipping me off? I do not understand.
97497,L532961,u2884,m190,DUKE,"Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?"
97498,L532759,u2884,m190,DUKE,Don't wear it out!
97499,L532758,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
97500,L532757,u2884,m190,DUKE,"You killed them, huh? Both of them?"
97501,L533646,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,Let's!
97502,L533645,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Let's blow, Chauncey."
97503,L533635,u2894,m190,SEFTON,We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
97504,L533634,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,What are the chances busting out of here?
97505,L533633,u2894,m190,SEFTON,You won't get off that cheap.
97506,L533632,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,It's on me.
97507,L533631,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
97508,L533630,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,Yeah.
97509,L533629,u2894,m190,SEFTON,What some brandy?
97510,L533628,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,Not you.
97511,L533627,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?"
97512,L533626,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,Sefton!
97513,L533625,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds."
97514,L533624,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,My legs are frozen.
97515,L533623,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!"
97516,L533150,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim."
97517,L533149,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,"Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back."
97518,L533148,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?"
97519,L533116,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk."
97520,L533115,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,Twenty-five.
97521,L533114,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars."
97522,L533112,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,"Yes, it would. Do we know each other?"
97523,L533111,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
97524,L533373,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
97525,L533372,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb."
97526,L533371,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
97527,L533361,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
97528,L533360,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
97529,L533359,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit."
97530,L533355,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
97531,L533354,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
97532,L533353,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
97533,L533352,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,You are being rude again.
97534,L533351,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?"
97535,L533350,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
97536,L533349,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you."
97537,L533275,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,Abfuehren!
97538,L533274,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,Ever try forty sleeping pills?
97539,L533273,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia."
97540,L533272,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I'm okay here. Why bother?
97541,L533271,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going."
97542,L533270,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,"I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel."
97543,L533269,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?"
97544,L533268,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I'll live.
97545,L533267,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men."
97546,L533266,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,105-353.
97547,L533265,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,What is your number?
97548,L533264,u2885,m190,DUNBAR,I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
97549,L533331,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
97550,L533330,u2887,m190,GERMAN LIEUTENANT,"The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily."
97551,L533329,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
97552,L533328,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
97553,L533327,u2887,m190,GERMAN LIEUTENANT,"As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool."
97554,L533326,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
97555,L533325,u2887,m190,GERMAN LIEUTENANT,"Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally."
97556,L533383,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
97557,L533382,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?"
97558,L533381,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,Isn't it?
97559,L533380,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,Interesting.
97560,L533379,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,"Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach."
97561,L533378,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,You were saying --?
97562,L533376,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
97563,L533375,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
97564,L533374,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,"And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely."
97565,L533370,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
97566,L533369,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur."
97567,L533368,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,What exactly is he charged with?
97568,L533367,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,It is.
97569,L533366,u2886,m190,GENEVA MAN,I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
97570,L533365,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?"
97571,L533190,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,And this?
97572,L533189,u2888,m190,HARRY,It's a mouse trap.
97573,L533188,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,What is this? This is water?
97574,L532974,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Raus! Raus! All of you!
97575,L532973,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades."
97576,L532957,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
97577,L532956,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!"
97578,L532950,u2888,m190,HARRY,You should live so long.
97579,L532949,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
97580,L532948,u2888,m190,HARRY,Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
97581,L532790,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Some are not bad at all.
97582,L532789,u2888,m190,HARRY,Jawohl!
97583,L532771,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
97584,L532770,u2888,m190,HARRY,Then droppen Sie dead!
97585,L532769,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Jawohl.
97586,L532768,u2888,m190,HARRY,Sprechen Sie deutsch?
97587,L532767,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Jawohl?
97588,L532766,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Say, Schulz --"
97589,L532765,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!"
97590,L533541,u2888,m190,HARRY,No. I want to draw.
97591,L533540,u2895,m190,STOSH,You want to go?
97592,L533539,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Let me do it, Hoffy."
97593,L533488,u2888,m190,HARRY,"This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!"
97594,L533487,u2895,m190,STOSH,Betty! Betty!
97595,L533486,u2888,m190,HARRY,Animal! Animal! Wake up!
97596,L533485,u2895,m190,STOSH,I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
97597,L533484,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Hey, Animal! Animal!"
97598,L533483,u2895,m190,STOSH,But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
97599,L533478,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Why, sure!"
97600,L533477,u2895,m190,STOSH,"May I have this dance, Miss?"
97601,L533457,u2895,m190,STOSH,There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
97602,L533456,u2888,m190,HARRY,You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
97603,L533455,u2895,m190,STOSH,"It's that song, Harry!"
97604,L533454,u2888,m190,HARRY,"You're crying, Animal."
97605,L533453,u2895,m190,STOSH,Let me alone.
97606,L533452,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!"
97607,L533429,u2895,m190,STOSH,"I'll open mine, too."
97608,L533428,u2888,m190,HARRY,I'll open mine now.
97609,L533426,u2888,m190,HARRY,Animal! Got a little something for you!
97610,L533425,u2895,m190,STOSH,"There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?"
97611,L533417,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Hey, here's Esther Williams."
97612,L533416,u2895,m190,STOSH,Do Grable.
97613,L533407,u2888,m190,HARRY,Do Jimmy Durante!
97614,L533406,u2895,m190,STOSH,"Grable, not Gable!"
97615,L533212,u2895,m190,STOSH,"Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys."
97616,L533211,u2888,m190,HARRY,Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
97617,L533197,u2895,m190,STOSH,You hold him. I'll slug him.
97618,L533196,u2888,m190,HARRY,That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
97619,L533093,u2888,m190,HARRY,"This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!"
97620,L533092,u2895,m190,STOSH,"Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?"
97621,L533091,u2888,m190,HARRY,"So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth."
97622,L533090,u2895,m190,STOSH,Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
97623,L533089,u2888,m190,HARRY,"It's not good for you, Animal."
97624,L533088,u2895,m190,STOSH,That's what I wanna hear.
97625,L533087,u2888,m190,HARRY,What do they always say?
97626,L533086,u2895,m190,STOSH,What do those broads say?
97627,L533018,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself."
97628,L533017,u2895,m190,STOSH,Harry -- I'm blind!
97629,L533011,u2888,m190,HARRY,Bombs away!
97630,L533010,u2895,m190,STOSH,She'll never forgive me!
97631,L533009,u2888,m190,HARRY,To the Brick Kremlin!
97632,L533008,u2888,m190,HARRY,Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
97633,L533007,u2895,m190,STOSH,You did?
97634,L533006,u2888,m190,HARRY,"It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick."
97635,L533005,u2895,m190,STOSH,How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
97636,L533004,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!"
97637,L533003,u2895,m190,STOSH,You'll fix me up!
97638,L533002,u2888,m190,HARRY,Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
97639,L533001,u2895,m190,STOSH,Not for me! Betty! Betty!
97640,L533000,u2888,m190,HARRY,So what? There's other women!
97641,L532999,u2895,m190,STOSH,Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
97642,L532993,u2895,m190,STOSH,You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
97643,L532992,u2888,m190,HARRY,I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
97644,L532991,u2895,m190,STOSH,Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
97645,L532988,u2895,m190,STOSH,"Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!"
97646,L532987,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?"
97647,L532939,u2895,m190,STOSH,He's the grrrrreatest!
97648,L532938,u2888,m190,HARRY,Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
97649,L532897,u2888,m190,HARRY,He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
97650,L532896,u2895,m190,STOSH,Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
97651,L532887,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas."
97652,L532886,u2895,m190,STOSH,Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
97653,L532880,u2895,m190,STOSH,It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
97654,L532879,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things."
97655,L532876,u2895,m190,STOSH,Where'd that come from?
97656,L532875,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Easy, Animal! Easy!"
97657,L532873,u2888,m190,HARRY,No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
97658,L532872,u2895,m190,STOSH,No?
97659,L532871,u2888,m190,HARRY,"No, Animal."
97660,L532861,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!"
97661,L532860,u2895,m190,STOSH,You're teasing me again!
97662,L532859,u2888,m190,HARRY,"If she don't want you, she don't get anything."
97663,L532858,u2895,m190,STOSH,Me? What if she don't want me?
97664,L532857,u2888,m190,HARRY,"What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!"
97665,L532856,u2895,m190,STOSH,What's the award?
97666,L532855,u2888,m190,HARRY,"How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'."
97667,L532854,u2895,m190,STOSH,Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
97668,L532853,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!"
97669,L532852,u2888,m190,HARRY,Betty Grable!
97670,L532851,u2895,m190,STOSH,Let me go!
97671,L532850,u2888,m190,HARRY,You want Betty Grable!
97672,L532849,u2895,m190,STOSH,I don't care if they wear galoshes!
97673,L532848,u2888,m190,HARRY,No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
97674,L532847,u2895,m190,STOSH,Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
97675,L532846,u2888,m190,HARRY,"It's chow, Animal! Chow!"
97676,L532844,u2888,m190,HARRY,"They'll shoot you, Animal!"
97677,L532843,u2895,m190,STOSH,Let me go! Let me go!
97678,L532840,u2895,m190,STOSH,Lay off! The blonde is mine!
97679,L532839,u2888,m190,HARRY,Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
97680,L532838,u2895,m190,STOSH,Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
97681,L532836,u2888,m190,HARRY,Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
97682,L532835,u2895,m190,STOSH,Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
97683,L532821,u2895,m190,STOSH,I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
97684,L532820,u2888,m190,HARRY,"I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --"
97685,L532819,u2895,m190,STOSH,You can say that again!
97686,L532818,u2888,m190,HARRY,"I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher."
97687,L532817,u2895,m190,STOSH,'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
97688,L532780,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!"
97689,L532779,u2895,m190,STOSH,"I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!"
97690,L532778,u2888,m190,HARRY,Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
97691,L532777,u2895,m190,STOSH,Why do you do this to me every morning?
97692,L532776,u2888,m190,HARRY,Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
97693,L532775,u2895,m190,STOSH,"Stop it, Harry!"
97694,L532774,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?"
97695,L532745,u2895,m190,STOSH,Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
97696,L532744,u2888,m190,HARRY,"Shut up, Animal!"
97697,L532711,u2888,m190,HARRY,Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
97698,L532710,u2895,m190,STOSH,"When you get going on those broads, think of me!"
97699,L533277,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
97700,L533276,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
97701,L533263,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Yes, sir."
97702,L533262,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
97703,L533261,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,You have a Lieutenant here...
97704,L533260,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Yes, sir."
97705,L533259,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?"
97706,L532808,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
97707,L532807,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial."
97708,L532806,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,Anything else?
97709,L532805,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud."
97710,L532804,u2896,m190,VON SCHERBACH,"Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?"
97711,L532803,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
97712,L533559,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
97713,L533558,u2892,m190,PRICE,Why the south latrine?
97714,L533557,u2889,m190,HOFFY,You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
97715,L533556,u2892,m190,PRICE,"What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine."
97716,L533548,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Any objections, men?"
97717,L533547,u2892,m190,PRICE,"I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?"
97718,L533546,u2889,m190,HOFFY,We've all done a poor job of it.
97719,L533545,u2892,m190,PRICE,"You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?"
97720,L533544,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it."
97721,L533514,u2889,m190,HOFFY,We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
97722,L533513,u2892,m190,PRICE,What about Schulz?
97723,L533504,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Good.
97724,L533503,u2892,m190,PRICE,"Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?"
97725,L533502,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead."
97726,L533501,u2892,m190,PRICE,"I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy."
97727,L533493,u2889,m190,HOFFY,I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
97728,L533492,u2892,m190,PRICE,What are you going to do?
97729,L533199,u2892,m190,PRICE,"The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?"
97730,L533198,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand."
97731,L533157,u2892,m190,PRICE,And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
97732,L533156,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?"
97733,L533036,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
97734,L533035,u2892,m190,PRICE,Not yet.
97735,L532964,u2892,m190,PRICE,"Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint."
97736,L532963,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with."
97737,L532925,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
97738,L532924,u2892,m190,PRICE,Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
97739,L532825,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning."
97740,L532824,u2892,m190,PRICE,Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
97741,L533437,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Come on, everybody!  Let's go!"
97742,L533436,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"You must get out. For your own good, you must get out."
97743,L533182,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound."
97744,L533181,u2889,m190,HOFFY,What radio?
97745,L533180,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio."
97746,L533179,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone."
97747,L532764,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
97748,L532763,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
97749,L532762,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank."
97750,L532761,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Los, los. Dummkopf!"
97751,L533620,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Check.
97752,L533619,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp."
97753,L533618,u2894,m190,SEFTON,You could use a new one yourself.
97754,L533612,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Shoot!
97755,L533611,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?"
97756,L533610,u2889,m190,HOFFY,What's the decoy?
97757,L533609,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy."
97758,L533608,u2894,m190,SEFTON,You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
97759,L533607,u2889,m190,HOFFY,You taking Dunbar?
97760,L533605,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
97761,L533604,u2889,m190,HOFFY,What are we going to do with him?
97762,L533592,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --"
97763,L533591,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Go on.
97764,L533580,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
97765,L533579,u2889,m190,HOFFY,You off your rocker?
97766,L533578,u2894,m190,SEFTON,You did!
97767,L533577,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Who did?
97768,L533576,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"You told them, Hoffy."
97769,L533575,u2889,m190,HOFFY,How do they know?
97770,L533572,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"I called it the last time, didn't I?"
97771,L533571,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --"
97772,L533570,u2894,m190,SEFTON,That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
97773,L533569,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?"
97774,L533563,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Anybody cover?
97775,L533562,u2889,m190,HOFFY,You starting that again?
97776,L533561,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
97777,L533512,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Okay, Price. You stay."
97778,L533511,u2894,m190,SEFTON,So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
97779,L533510,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Right.
97780,L533509,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?"
97781,L533508,u2889,m190,HOFFY,You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
97782,L533322,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
97783,L533321,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"You heard that, Sefton?"
97784,L533257,u2894,m190,SEFTON,It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
97785,L533256,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"What's it add up to you, Sefton?"
97786,L533249,u2894,m190,SEFTON,There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
97787,L533248,u2889,m190,HOFFY,We did it.
97788,L533247,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"What happened, Cookie? Who did it?"
97789,L533242,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Borscht?
97790,L533241,u2889,m190,HOFFY,I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
97791,L533240,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?"
97792,L533119,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you."
97793,L533118,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?"
97794,L533117,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Lay off, Sefton."
97795,L533028,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
97796,L533027,u2894,m190,SEFTON,You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
97797,L533026,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Says me.
97798,L533025,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Says who?
97799,L533024,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here."
97800,L532935,u2889,m190,HOFFY,Are we boring you?
97801,L532934,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?"
97802,L532889,u2894,m190,SEFTON,A little weak today.
97803,L532888,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack."
97804,L532725,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Go on, Sefton -- butt out!"
97805,L532724,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Anybody call?
97806,L532706,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
97807,L532705,u2889,m190,HOFFY,"Stay out of it, Sefton."
97808,L533068,u2895,m190,STOSH,Oh.
97809,L533067,u2890,m190,MARKO,"Give this to Joey, will you?"
97810,L533066,u2895,m190,STOSH,Yeah?
97811,L533063,u2895,m190,STOSH,Just what makes you so popular?
97812,L533062,u2890,m190,MARKO,Shapiro. Shapiro.
97813,L533061,u2895,m190,STOSH,Nothing for Kuzawa?
97814,L533060,u2890,m190,MARKO,Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
97815,L532916,u2890,m190,MARKO,"At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp."
97816,L532915,u2895,m190,STOSH,You can tell Father Murray to --
97817,L532914,u2890,m190,MARKO,Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
97818,L533598,u2894,m190,SEFTON,The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
97819,L533597,u2892,m190,PRICE,The what?
97820,L533590,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?"
97821,L533589,u2892,m190,PRICE,Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
97822,L533588,u2894,m190,SEFTON,What time?
97823,L533587,u2892,m190,PRICE,"December seventh, forty-one."
97824,L533586,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?"
97825,L533585,u2892,m190,PRICE,I'll kill you for that!
97826,L533584,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
97827,L533583,u2892,m190,PRICE,Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
97828,L533582,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price."
97829,L533581,u2892,m190,PRICE,No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
97830,L533574,u2894,m190,SEFTON,The Germans know where Dunbar is.
97831,L533573,u2892,m190,PRICE,Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
97832,L533531,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
97833,L533530,u2892,m190,PRICE,"Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?"
97834,L533529,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?"
97835,L533528,u2892,m190,PRICE,What did you say?
97836,L533527,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Ach so!
97837,L533526,u2894,m190,SEFTON,A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
97838,L533525,u2892,m190,PRICE,"Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will."
97839,L533524,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
97840,L533523,u2892,m190,PRICE,Are you questioning me?
97841,L533522,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
97842,L533521,u2892,m190,PRICE,Thirty-fifth.
97843,L533520,u2894,m190,SEFTON,I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
97844,L533519,u2892,m190,PRICE,"Yes, I'm from Cleveland."
97845,L533518,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you."
97846,L533517,u2892,m190,PRICE,Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
97847,L533516,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?"
97848,L533251,u2894,m190,SEFTON,What about the radio?
97849,L533250,u2892,m190,PRICE,So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
97850,L533030,u2894,m190,SEFTON,They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
97851,L533029,u2892,m190,PRICE,When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
97852,L532908,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come."
97853,L532907,u2892,m190,PRICE,They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
97854,L532906,u2894,m190,SEFTON,And what's that crack supposed to mean?
97855,L532905,u2894,m190,SEFTON,I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
97856,L532904,u2892,m190,PRICE,Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
97857,L532903,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?"
97858,L533446,u2892,m190,PRICE,Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
97859,L533445,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Wie hat er's gemacht?
97860,L533444,u2892,m190,PRICE,Ich weiss alles.
97861,L533443,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
97862,L533186,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see."
97863,L533185,u2892,m190,PRICE,We have no radio.
97864,L533184,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Give me the radio.
97865,L533183,u2892,m190,PRICE,"Schulz, you're off your nut!"
97866,L532968,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
97867,L532967,u2892,m190,PRICE,Which one of us is the informer?
97868,L532786,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!"
97869,L532785,u2892,m190,PRICE,Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
97870,L532784,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
97871,L532756,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach."
97872,L532755,u2892,m190,PRICE,"Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?"
97873,L533439,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Not particularly.
97874,L533438,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
97875,L533307,u2894,m190,SEFTON,How many do you want? A thousand?
97876,L533306,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Talk what? I do not know anything!
97877,L533305,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!"
97878,L533304,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,No! No!
97879,L533303,u2894,m190,SEFTON,I'll make it five hundred!
97880,L533302,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Yes, you do!"
97881,L533301,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,I do not want those cigarettes.
97882,L533300,u2894,m190,SEFTON,The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
97883,L533299,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,What guy?
97884,L533298,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Who's the guy, Schulz?"
97885,L533297,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
97886,L533296,u2894,m190,SEFTON,And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
97887,L533295,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
97888,L533294,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Here. Take them.
97889,L533293,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
97890,L533292,u2894,m190,SEFTON,How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
97891,L533291,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
97892,L532972,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
97893,L532971,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati."
97894,L532783,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Fine -- fine!
97895,L532782,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?"
97896,L532781,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Good morning, Sefton."
97897,L533192,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?"
97898,L533191,u2895,m190,STOSH,My grandmother's ear-muffs.
97899,L533178,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket."
97900,L533177,u2895,m190,STOSH,We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
97901,L533176,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span."
97902,L532960,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
97903,L532959,u2895,m190,STOSH,Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
97904,L532958,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged."
97905,L532955,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
97906,L532954,u2895,m190,STOSH,Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
97907,L532953,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,That is my wife.
97908,L532952,u2895,m190,STOSH,Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
97909,L532951,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,This is me in Cincinnati.
97910,L532947,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
97911,L532946,u2895,m190,STOSH,Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
97912,L532945,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,"Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?"
97913,L532792,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
97914,L532791,u2895,m190,STOSH,Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
97915,L532788,u2893,m190,SCHULTZ,Russian women prisoners?
97916,L532787,u2895,m190,STOSH,"Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?"
97917,L533617,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face."
97918,L533616,u2895,m190,STOSH,You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
97919,L533596,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box."
97920,L533595,u2895,m190,STOSH,You heard him.
97921,L533316,u2895,m190,STOSH,Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
97922,L533315,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"So you're stuck with me, eh?"
97923,L533244,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Oh! Somebody was peeking!
97924,L533243,u2895,m190,STOSH,Have a nice time over there?
97925,L533056,u2895,m190,STOSH,"Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?"
97926,L533055,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie."
97927,L532893,u2894,m190,SEFTON,What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
97928,L532892,u2895,m190,STOSH,That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
97929,L532883,u2894,m190,SEFTON,Just don't drool on it.
97930,L532882,u2895,m190,STOSH,Is it all right if we smell it?
97931,L532878,u2895,m190,STOSH,A chicken?
97932,L532877,u2894,m190,SEFTON,"From a chicken, bug-wit."
97933,L545913,u2897,m191,B'ETOR,Full disruptors.
97934,L545912,u2905,m191,LURSA,Target their Bridge.
97935,L545882,u2897,m191,B'ETOR,"I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!"
97936,L545881,u2905,m191,LURSA,Where is he now?
97937,L545872,u2897,m191,B'ETOR,Then when is he going to Engineering?
97938,L545871,u2905,m191,LURSA,He is.
97939,L545870,u2897,m191,B'ETOR,I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
97940,L545860,u2897,m191,B'ETOR,Where is he?
97941,L545859,u2905,m191,LURSA,It's working.
97942,L545849,u2905,m191,LURSA,We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
97943,L545848,u2897,m191,B'ETOR,The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
97944,L545692,u2905,m191,LURSA,HoS qorDu.
97945,L545691,u2897,m191,B'ETOR,Toh-pak-cha=8A
97946,L545378,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm."
97947,L545377,u2898,m191,CHEKOV,"Twelve years, sir."
97948,L545376,u2903,m191,KIRK,But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
97949,L545358,u2903,m191,KIRK,"I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final."
97950,L545357,u2898,m191,CHEKOV,Captain=8A
97951,L545353,u2898,m191,CHEKOV,Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
97952,L545352,u2903,m191,KIRK,Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
97953,L545349,u2903,m191,KIRK,Thanks for pointing that out.
97954,L545348,u2898,m191,CHEKOV,"Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way."
97955,L545833,u2906,m191,PICARD,I have to find a way to get to Soran.
97956,L545832,u2899,m191,DATA,"Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir."
97957,L545828,u2899,m191,DATA,"Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading."

97960,L545802,u2899,m191,DATA,Approximately two hundred thirty million.
97961,L545801,u2906,m191,PICARD,Population?
97962,L545800,u2899,m191,DATA,"Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society."
97963,L545799,u2906,m191,PICARD,Are any of them inhabited?
97964,L545798,u2906,m191,PICARD,And destroy every planet in the system.
97965,L545797,u2899,m191,DATA,"It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa."
97966,L545796,u2906,m191,PICARD,That's where he's going.
97967,L545793,u2899,m191,DATA,"Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system."
97968,L545792,u2906,m191,PICARD,"He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?"
97969,L545789,u2899,m191,DATA,I believe so.
97970,L545788,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?"
97971,L545785,u2899,m191,DATA,I believe so.
97972,L545784,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?"
97973,L545781,u2906,m191,PICARD,Can you project its course?
97974,L545780,u2899,m191,DATA,This is its current position.
97975,L545778,u2899,m191,DATA,The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
97976,L545777,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?"
97977,L545776,u2899,m191,DATA,"According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-"
97978,L545775,u2899,m191,DATA,Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
97979,L545774,u2906,m191,PICARD,No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
97980,L545773,u2899,m191,DATA,"But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?"
97981,L545772,u2906,m191,PICARD,Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
97982,L545771,u2899,m191,DATA,I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
97983,L545770,u2906,m191,PICARD,What do you mean?
97984,L545769,u2899,m191,DATA,"No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory."
97985,L545768,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Data, are you all right?"
97986,L545767,u2899,m191,DATA,It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
97987,L545766,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant."
97988,L545765,u2899,m191,DATA,"The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon."
97989,L545764,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star."
97990,L545763,u2899,m191,DATA,"Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours."
97991,L545762,u2906,m191,PICARD,Data?
97992,L545761,u2906,m191,PICARD,When is it expected back?
97993,L545760,u2899,m191,DATA,"According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years"
97994,L545926,u2899,m191,DATA,One minute to warp core breach.
97995,L545925,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"That's it, Bridge- we're all out!"
97996,L545639,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
97997,L545638,u2899,m191,DATA,I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
97998,L545637,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"Data, are you all right?"
97999,L545635,u2899,m191,DATA,"I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong"
98000,L545634,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"Data, this isn't the time."
98001,L545625,u2899,m191,DATA,It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
98002,L545624,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"I don't see a control panel, or an access port."
98003,L545621,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,Thanks.
98004,L545620,u2899,m191,DATA,I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
98005,L545619,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago."
98006,L545618,u2899,m191,DATA,During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
98007,L545617,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,What?
98008,L545615,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,You get what?
98009,L545614,u2899,m191,DATA,I get it. I get it.
98010,L545589,u2899,m191,DATA,I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
98011,L545588,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,Really? What do you feel?
98012,L545587,u2899,m191,DATA,I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
98013,L545586,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,Well?
98014,L545572,u2899,m191,DATA,Agreed.
98015,L545571,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?"
98016,L545569,u2899,m191,DATA,"That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more ""human""- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer."
98017,L545568,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
98018,L545567,u2899,m191,DATA,It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
98019,L545566,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?"
98020,L545565,u2899,m191,DATA,I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
98021,L545564,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water."
98022,L545563,u2899,m191,DATA,Is she still angry?
98023,L545934,u2907,m191,RIKER,"All hands, brace for impact!"
98024,L545933,u2899,m191,DATA,I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
98025,L545903,u2899,m191,DATA,"Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems."
98026,L545902,u2907,m191,RIKER,Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
98027,L545716,u2899,m191,DATA,"I hope so, sir."
98028,L545715,u2907,m191,RIKER,"We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back."
98029,L545714,u2899,m191,DATA,I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
98030,L545713,u2907,m191,RIKER,Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
98031,L545544,u2907,m191,RIKER,The station complement was nineteen.
98032,L545543,u2899,m191,DATA,"Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain."
98033,L545488,u2900,m191,DEMORA,There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
98034,L545487,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,"You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign."
98035,L545475,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,I'll go. You have the Bridge.
98036,L545474,u2900,m191,DEMORA,"Deck 15, section 21-alpha."
98037,L545433,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,Beam them directly to Sickbay.
98038,L545432,u2900,m191,DEMORA,"We're within range, sir."
98039,L545407,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,On screen.
98040,L545406,u2900,m191,DEMORA,"We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain."
98041,L545402,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
98042,L545401,u2900,m191,DEMORA,The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
98043,L545400,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,Can you locate them?
98044,L545984,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?"
98045,L545983,u2906,m191,PICARD,"You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-"
98046,L545982,u2901,m191,GUINAN,What makes you think things will be any different this time?
98047,L545981,u2906,m191,PICARD,"I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him."
98048,L545980,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time."
98049,L545979,u2906,m191,PICARD,I don't understand.
98050,L545978,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"Yes, where would you go?"
98051,L545977,u2906,m191,PICARD,Can I?
98052,L545976,u2901,m191,GUINAN,Why would you want to leave?
98053,L545975,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?"
98054,L545971,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here."
98055,L545970,u2906,m191,PICARD,These are my children...my children.
98056,L545967,u2901,m191,GUINAN,Wherever he wanted to be.
98057,L545966,u2906,m191,PICARD,Where is he now?
98058,L545965,u2901,m191,GUINAN,All of us.
98059,L545964,u2906,m191,PICARD,Soran?
98060,L545963,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind."
98061,L545962,u2906,m191,PICARD,Left behind?
98062,L545961,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an ""echo"" of the person you know. A part she left behind."
98063,L545960,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise."
98064,L545959,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"Enjoy them, Jean-Luc."
98065,L545958,u2906,m191,PICARD,"But I never had a wife, children, a home like this."
98066,L545957,u2901,m191,GUINAN,For you. This is where you wanted to be.
98067,L545956,u2906,m191,PICARD,This is the Nexus?
98068,L545955,u2901,m191,GUINAN,You're in the Nexus.
98069,L545954,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?"
98070,L545737,u2906,m191,PICARD,"But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan."
98071,L545736,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again."
98072,L545735,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Your ""sixth sense""- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?"
98073,L545734,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time."
98074,L545730,u2901,m191,GUINAN,I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
98075,L545729,u2906,m191,PICARD,What happened to you?
98076,L545728,u2901,m191,GUINAN,That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
98077,L545726,u2906,m191,PICARD,"What's the ""Nexus""?"
98078,L545725,u2901,m191,GUINAN,Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
98079,L545724,u2906,m191,PICARD,Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
98080,L545723,u2901,m191,GUINAN,"Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it."
98081,L545722,u2906,m191,PICARD,Do you remember him?
98082,L545429,u2903,m191,KIRK,Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
98083,L545428,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
98084,L545416,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,"It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free."
98085,L545415,u2903,m191,KIRK,You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
98086,L545414,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,We don't have a tractor beam.
98087,L545391,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,"Please, I insist."
98088,L545390,u2903,m191,KIRK,"No, no. Thank you."
98089,L545389,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,"Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway."
98090,L545388,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Oh, of course."
98091,L545387,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,"Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats."
98092,L545365,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,"Please, please."
98093,L545364,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Well, may we have a look around?"
98094,L545362,u2903,m191,KIRK,It's our pleasure.
98095,L545361,u2902,m191,HARRIMAN,I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
98096,L546053,u2903,m191,KIRK,Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
98097,L546052,u2906,m191,PICARD,Yes.  Thank you.
98098,L546051,u2903,m191,KIRK,Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
98099,L546050,u2906,m191,PICARD,I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
98100,L546042,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that."
98101,L546041,u2906,m191,PICARD,You could say that.
98102,L546040,u2903,m191,KIRK,I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
98103,L546039,u2906,m191,PICARD,That's right.
98104,L546038,u2903,m191,KIRK,How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
98105,L546035,u2906,m191,PICARD,I hadn't planned on it.
98106,L546034,u2903,m191,KIRK,Close to retirement?
98107,L546033,u2906,m191,PICARD,That's right.
98108,L546032,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Captain of the Enterprise, huh?"
98109,L546030,u2903,m191,KIRK,"She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters."
98110,L546029,u2906,m191,PICARD,Antonia?
98111,L546024,u2903,m191,KIRK,This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
98112,L546023,u2906,m191,PICARD,Better?
98113,L546022,u2903,m191,KIRK,"No, no, it's not. It's better."
98114,L546018,u2903,m191,KIRK,"I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time."
98115,L546017,u2906,m191,PICARD,You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
98116,L546016,u2903,m191,KIRK,You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
98117,L546013,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing."
98118,L546012,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-"
98119,L546011,u2903,m191,KIRK,"So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?"
98120,L545996,u2906,m191,PICARD,I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
98121,L545995,u2903,m191,KIRK,"This clock, I gave this clock to Bones."
98122,L545988,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Yes, yes, it is."
98123,L545987,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Beautiful day, isn't it?"
98124,L545482,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,"Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!"
98125,L545481,u2903,m191,KIRK,Kirk here.
98126,L545478,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,I always do.
98127,L545477,u2903,m191,KIRK,Keep her together until I get back.
98128,L545473,u2903,m191,KIRK,Where are the deflector relays?
98129,L545472,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,"Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish."
98130,L545469,u2903,m191,KIRK,"Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command."
98131,L545468,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,Aye.
98132,L545467,u2903,m191,KIRK,A photon torpedo?
98133,L545466,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
98134,L545465,u2903,m191,KIRK,I thought you might.
98135,L545464,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,But I do have a theory...
98136,L545462,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
98137,L545461,u2903,m191,KIRK,The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
98138,L545443,u2903,m191,KIRK,Phasing? To where?
98139,L545442,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
98140,L545384,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,"It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time."
98141,L545383,u2903,m191,KIRK,Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
98142,L545382,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,"And what would that be, sir?"
98143,L545381,u2903,m191,KIRK,"You know, Scotty, it amazes me."
98144,L545356,u2903,m191,KIRK,"When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it."
98145,L545355,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,"What do you mean, you're not going? We promised."
98146,L545354,u2903,m191,KIRK,"I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute."
98147,L545351,u2908,m191,SCOTTY,I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
98148,L545350,u2903,m191,KIRK,Oh
98149,L545758,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
98150,L545757,u2909,m191,SORAN,We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
98151,L545756,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"No, I didn't know that."
98152,L545755,u2909,m191,SORAN,"I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?"
98153,L545754,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,"Yeah, they're full of great ideas."
98154,L545753,u2909,m191,SORAN,"Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg."
98155,L545751,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
98156,L545750,u2909,m191,SORAN,What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
98157,L545749,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,No.
98158,L545748,u2909,m191,SORAN,"Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?"
98159,L545747,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,I was ordered to by the Captain.
98160,L545746,u2909,m191,SORAN,I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
98161,L545743,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,What do you want?
98162,L545742,u2909,m191,SORAN,"Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not."
98163,L545741,u2904,m191,LA FORGE,What's normal?
98164,L545740,u2909,m191,SORAN,"A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?"
98165,L546082,u2906,m191,PICARD,You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
98166,L546081,u2907,m191,RIKER,I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
98167,L545831,u2906,m191,PICARD,Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
98168,L545830,u2907,m191,RIKER,That's a pretty big margin of error.
98169,L545822,u2906,m191,PICARD,They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
98170,L545821,u2907,m191,RIKER,Maybe they're not out there.
98171,L545672,u2906,m191,PICARD,How is that possible?
98172,L545671,u2907,m191,RIKER,A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
98173,L545670,u2906,m191,PICARD,Report.
98174,L545584,u2906,m191,PICARD,No. Thank you.
98175,L545583,u2907,m191,RIKER,"Sir, is there anything wrong?"
98176,L545582,u2906,m191,PICARD,Understood. That will be all.
98177,L545581,u2907,m191,RIKER,"There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away."
98178,L545580,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Thank you, Number One."
98179,L545579,u2907,m191,RIKER,"No, sir."
98180,L545578,u2906,m191,PICARD,Is there a problem?
98181,L545577,u2907,m191,RIKER,You want me to contact Starfleet?
98182,L545576,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector."
98183,L545575,u2907,m191,RIKER,We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
98184,L545574,u2906,m191,PICARD,There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
98185,L545547,u2906,m191,PICARD,Make it so.
98186,L545546,u2907,m191,RIKER,Sir?
98187,L545524,u2907,m191,RIKER,"Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women."
98188,L545523,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you."
98189,L545521,u2907,m191,RIKER,"Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander."
98190,L545520,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there."
98191,L545511,u2907,m191,RIKER,"When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?"
98192,L545510,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?"
98193,L545824,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms."
98194,L545823,u2910,m191,TROI,Or perhaps they're on the surface.
98195,L545664,u2910,m191,TROI,"There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career."
98196,L545663,u2906,m191,PICARD,"My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs."
98197,L545662,u2910,m191,TROI,You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
98198,L545661,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son..."
98199,L545660,u2910,m191,TROI,"Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?"
98200,L545659,u2906,m191,PICARD,"In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own."
98201,L545658,u2910,m191,TROI,"It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you."
98202,L545657,u2906,m191,PICARD,What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
98203,L545656,u2910,m191,TROI,"Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother."
98204,L545654,u2906,m191,PICARD,"All right, all right. You've made your point."
98205,L545653,u2910,m191,TROI,"Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  ""Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"""
98206,L545652,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now."
98207,L545651,u2910,m191,TROI,"You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed."
98208,L545650,u2906,m191,PICARD,"As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not."
98209,L545649,u2910,m191,TROI,"I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-"
98210,L545648,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you."
98211,L545647,u2910,m191,TROI,"Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you."
98212,L545646,u2906,m191,PICARD,Counselor. What can I do for you?
98213,L545532,u2906,m191,PICARD,Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
98214,L545531,u2910,m191,TROI,"Captain, are you all right?"
98215,L545884,u2906,m191,PICARD,Thank you.
98216,L545883,u2909,m191,SORAN,"Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt."
98217,L545880,u2909,m191,SORAN,Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
98218,L545879,u2906,m191,PICARD,The Nexus.
98219,L545878,u2909,m191,SORAN,What if I told you I found a new truth?
98220,L545877,u2906,m191,PICARD,"We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence."
98221,L545867,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?"
98222,L545866,u2909,m191,SORAN,"I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced."
98223,L545856,u2909,m191,SORAN,The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
98224,L545855,u2906,m191,PICARD,The thought had crossed my mind.
98225,L545854,u2909,m191,SORAN,You must think I'm quite the madman.
98226,L545604,u2906,m191,PICARD,We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
98227,L545603,u2909,m191,SORAN,"The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost."
98228,L545602,u2906,m191,PICARD,"Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-"
98229,L545601,u2909,m191,SORAN,Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
98230,L545600,u2906,m191,PICARD,Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
98231,L545599,u2909,m191,SORAN,"Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming."
98232,L545598,u2906,m191,PICARD,Doctor Soran?
98233,L545909,u2907,m191,RIKER,"We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode."
98234,L545908,u2911,m191,WORF,"Aye, sir."
98235,L545907,u2907,m191,RIKER,"Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak."
98236,L545905,u2907,m191,RIKER,"Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil."
98237,L545904,u2911,m191,WORF,"As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop."
98238,L545900,u2911,m191,WORF,I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
98239,L545899,u2907,m191,RIKER,Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
98240,L545898,u2911,m191,WORF,It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
98241,L545894,u2907,m191,RIKER,Lock phasers and return fire!
98242,L545893,u2911,m191,WORF,They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
98243,L545708,u2907,m191,RIKER,"Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?"
98244,L545707,u2911,m191,WORF,"I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters."
98245,L545674,u2907,m191,RIKER,The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
98246,L545673,u2911,m191,WORF,Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
98247,L545612,u2911,m191,WORF,"Aye, sir."
98248,L545611,u2907,m191,RIKER,Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
98249,L545610,u2907,m191,RIKER,Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
98250,L545609,u2911,m191,WORF,"An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it."
98251,L545608,u2907,m191,RIKER,Trilithium?
98252,L545607,u2911,m191,WORF,One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
98253,L545549,u2907,m191,RIKER,"Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan."
98254,L545548,u2911,m191,WORF,These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
98255,L545542,u2911,m191,WORF,There are no other ships in the system.
98256,L545541,u2907,m191,RIKER,It looks like we're too late.
98257,L545536,u2907,m191,RIKER,"You see the top yardarm, now look to the-"
98258,L545535,u2911,m191,WORF,The royal...studs?
98259,L535048,u2927,m192,STYLES,Execute!
98260,L535047,u2912,m192,1ST OFFICER,"Transwarp at your command, Sir!"
98261,L535039,u2927,m192,STYLES,"If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock..."
98262,L535038,u2912,m192,1ST OFFICER,"Tractor beam, aye!"
98263,L535037,u2927,m192,STYLES,"And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!"
98264,L535036,u2912,m192,1ST OFFICER,Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
98265,L535028,u2927,m192,STYLES,"Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power."
98266,L535027,u2912,m192,1ST OFFICER,All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
98267,L535026,u2927,m192,STYLES,Status!
98268,L534663,u2931,m192,WOMAN,"Soon, Captain... Quite soon."
98269,L534662,u2913,m192,CAPTAIN,What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
98270,L534648,u2913,m192,CAPTAIN,Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
98271,L534647,u2931,m192,WOMAN,Put me on the hailing frequency.
98272,L534646,u2913,m192,CAPTAIN,Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
98273,L534645,u2931,m192,WOMAN,He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
98274,L534644,u2913,m192,CAPTAIN,"Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!"
98275,L535160,u2918,m192,KIRK,Scotty...?
98276,L535159,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Sir, the shields... Non- responsive."
98277,L535121,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu."
98278,L535120,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Nothing on my scanner, sir."
98279,L535113,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please."
98280,L535112,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,For an instant... A scout class vessel.
98281,L535111,u2918,m192,KIRK,"What did you see, Chekov?"
98282,L535110,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it."
98283,L535093,u2918,m192,KIRK,Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
98284,L535092,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Still no response, sir."
98285,L535084,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals."
98286,L535083,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel."
98287,L535081,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Aye, sir."
98288,L535080,u2918,m192,KIRK,"What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban."
98289,L535079,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,Nothing. As before.
98290,L535078,u2918,m192,KIRK,Response?
98291,L535077,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us."
98292,L535076,u2918,m192,KIRK,"You did great, Bones... Just great."
98293,L535041,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now."
98294,L535040,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir."
98295,L535019,u2918,m192,KIRK,"No reply, Chekov... Continue on course..."
98296,L535018,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel."
98297,L535017,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Calm yourself, Bones."
98298,L534974,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
98299,L534973,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge."
98300,L534875,u2918,m192,KIRK,Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
98301,L534874,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
98302,L534788,u2918,m192,KIRK,I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
98303,L534787,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,Will we get another ship?
98304,L534717,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there."
98305,L534716,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!"
98306,L534715,u2914,m192,CHEKOV,"An energy reading from 'C"" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters..."
98307,L534714,u2918,m192,KIRK,Mr. Chekov -- ?
98308,L534912,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,On screen.
98309,L534911,u2915,m192,COMM OFFICER,"Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!"
98310,L534910,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,Locate.
98311,L534909,u2915,m192,COMM OFFICER,Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
98312,L534682,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
98313,L534681,u2915,m192,COMM OFFICER,"Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?"
98314,L534594,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"Dr. Marcus, it's your planet."
98315,L534593,u2915,m192,COMM OFFICER,"Aye sir, coding now."
98316,L534691,u2916,m192,DAVID,Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
98317,L534690,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
98318,L534685,u2916,m192,DAVID,"Not from here, no."
98319,L534684,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: ""nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated."" Can you guarantee that?"
98320,L534683,u2916,m192,DAVID,Why don't we beam it up?
98321,L534676,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,What is it?
98322,L534675,u2916,m192,DAVID,I don't believe it...
98323,L534613,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
98324,L534612,u2916,m192,DAVID,It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
98325,L534611,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,Could it be Spock's?
98326,L535199,u2916,m192,DAVID,"I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --"
98327,L535198,u2918,m192,KIRK,"David, I don't understand..."
98328,L535197,u2916,m192,DAVID,I went wrong.
98329,L535196,u2918,m192,KIRK,David!... What went wrong?
98330,L535195,u2916,m192,DAVID,It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
98331,L535194,u2918,m192,KIRK,David... Sorry I'm late.
98332,L535193,u2916,m192,DAVID,"Hello, sir. It's David."
98333,L535070,u2916,m192,DAVID,No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
98334,L535069,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,I'll go...
98335,L535068,u2916,m192,DAVID,"Whoever they are, they're getting closer."
98336,L535067,u2916,m192,DAVID,I still don't...
98337,L535066,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
98338,L535065,u2916,m192,DAVID,I don't understand.
98339,L535064,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
98340,L535063,u2916,m192,DAVID,Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
98341,L535062,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,... How long?
98342,L535061,u2916,m192,DAVID,The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
98343,L535060,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,And Spock with it. They are joined together.
98344,L535059,u2916,m192,DAVID,This planet is aging in surges.
98345,L534951,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
98346,L534950,u2916,m192,DAVID,"If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!"
98347,L534949,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"So, like your father, you changed the rules..."
98348,L534948,u2916,m192,DAVID,My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
98349,L534947,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Did your collaborator know?
98350,L534946,u2916,m192,DAVID,It was the only way to solve certain problems --
98351,L534945,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
98352,L534944,u2916,m192,DAVID,I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
98353,L534943,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Why?
98354,L534942,u2916,m192,DAVID,Not exactly.
98355,L534941,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?"
98356,L534940,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,I have already made one transmission too many...
98357,L534939,u2916,m192,DAVID,Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
98358,L534938,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,That may be difficult...
98359,L534937,u2916,m192,DAVID,How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
98360,L534936,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Logic indicates that is the case.
98361,L534935,u2916,m192,DAVID,"You mean, we're stranded down here?!"
98362,L534934,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
98363,L534933,u2916,m192,DAVID,"Saavik... My god, what happened to them?"
98364,L534849,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out."
98365,L534848,u2916,m192,DAVID,Later. Let's go...
98366,L534783,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Spock's burial robe.
98367,L534782,u2916,m192,DAVID,What is it?
98368,L534780,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
98369,L534779,u2916,m192,DAVID,"Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied."
98370,L534778,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,David --
98371,L534777,u2916,m192,DAVID,.          .. Spock's tube...
98372,L534770,u2916,m192,DAVID,"We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!"
98373,L534769,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,My readings indicate great instability.
98374,L534768,u2916,m192,DAVID,I'll handle that later.
98375,L534767,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
98376,L534689,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,... Or <u>who</u>.
98377,L534688,u2916,m192,DAVID,"Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is..."
98378,L534680,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
98379,L534679,u2916,m192,DAVID,There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
98380,L534674,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
98381,L534673,u2916,m192,DAVID,Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
98382,L534672,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
98383,L534671,u2916,m192,DAVID,Short range scan.
98384,L534670,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
98385,L534610,u2916,m192,DAVID,A photon tube...!
98386,L534609,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
98387,L534608,u2916,m192,DAVID,There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
98388,L534607,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Negative, on surface... A manufactured object."
98389,L534606,u2916,m192,DAVID,Underground deposit?
98390,L534605,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Same sector. Metallic mass.
98391,L534604,u2916,m192,DAVID,It's a little early to celebrate.
98392,L534603,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
98393,L534602,u2916,m192,DAVID,All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
98394,L534601,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,... Fascinating.
98395,L534600,u2916,m192,DAVID,It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
98396,L534599,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
98397,L534598,u2916,m192,DAVID,"Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four."
98398,L534597,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius."
98399,L534596,u2916,m192,DAVID,"This is where the fun begins, Saavik!"
98400,L534920,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
98401,L534919,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Captain, what's happening?!"
98402,L534907,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go."
98403,L534906,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir."
98404,L534905,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions."
98405,L534904,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"None that I can detect, sir."
98406,L534903,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
98407,L534902,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
98408,L534901,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?"
98409,L534896,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"Yes, Saavik, go ahead..."
98410,L534895,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please..."
98411,L534847,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Do you have an explanation?
98412,L534846,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous..."
98413,L534845,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate."
98414,L534776,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"I'll try to remember that, Captain."
98415,L534775,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb."
98416,L534774,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level."
98417,L534773,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
98418,L534687,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,"""... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger."" I know the book, Saavik."
98419,L534686,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
98420,L534678,u2917,m192,ESTEBAN,You said there wouldn't be any.
98421,L534677,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form."
98422,L535294,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!"
98423,L535293,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Just him, sir!"
98424,L535292,u2918,m192,KIRK,How many more?
98425,L535169,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
98426,L535168,u2918,m192,KIRK,What's wrong?
98427,L535167,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so..."
98428,L535166,u2918,m192,KIRK,"I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --"
98429,L535154,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up..."
98430,L535153,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird."
98431,L535152,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Good shooting, Scotty."
98432,L535146,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Aye, sir!"
98433,L535145,u2918,m192,KIRK,Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
98434,L535143,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Aye, sir!"
98435,L535142,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --"
98436,L535074,u2918,m192,KIRK,Scan for vessels in pursuit!
98437,L535073,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now."
98438,L535032,u2918,m192,KIRK,"The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!"
98439,L535031,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,Sir...?
98440,L535030,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott."
98441,L535013,u2918,m192,KIRK,Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
98442,L535012,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word."
98443,L535011,u2918,m192,KIRK,Mr. Scott?
98444,L535008,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not."
98445,L535007,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her."
98446,L534708,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant."
98447,L534707,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have."
98448,L534706,u2918,m192,KIRK,Mr. Scott...
98449,L534631,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters."
98450,L534630,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?"
98451,L534629,u2918,m192,KIRK,Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
98452,L534628,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two."
98453,L534627,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?"
98454,L534626,u2925,m192,SCOTTY,"I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock."
98455,L535332,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Much is at stake...
98456,L535331,u2918,m192,KIRK,My God...
98457,L535321,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,. He will remain always as he is.
98458,L535320,u2918,m192,KIRK,And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
98459,L535319,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
98460,L535318,u2918,m192,KIRK,But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
98461,L535317,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
98462,L535316,u2918,m192,KIRK,What? What are you saying?
98463,L535315,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible."
98464,L535307,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Goodbye, David."
98465,L535306,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,The Genesis planet is gone.
98466,L535268,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us..."
98467,L535267,u2918,m192,KIRK,Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
98468,L535264,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
98469,L535263,u2918,m192,KIRK,What happened...?
98470,L535192,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
98471,L535191,u2918,m192,KIRK,This Vulcan -- is he alive?
98472,L535190,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance."
98473,L535189,u2918,m192,KIRK,Saavik... Is... David with you?
98474,L535188,u2923,m192,SAAVIK,"Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik."
98475,L535362,u2918,m192,KIRK,"You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!"
98476,L535361,u2926,m192,SPOCK,The ship... Out of danger...?
98477,L535360,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Yes, yes, Spock..."
98478,L535358,u2918,m192,KIRK,Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
98479,L535357,u2926,m192,SPOCK,Why would you do this...?
98480,L535356,u2918,m192,KIRK,You would have done the same for me.
98481,L535355,u2926,m192,SPOCK,My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
98482,L535354,u2918,m192,KIRK,Yes. And I know you.
98483,L535353,u2926,m192,SPOCK,I know you... Do I not?
98484,L535329,u2928,m192,SULU,"It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!"
98485,L535328,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Mr. Sulu, you're on manual."
98486,L535323,u2918,m192,KIRK,Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
98487,L535322,u2928,m192,SULU,"The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir."
98488,L535309,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below."
98489,L535308,u2928,m192,SULU,We are clear and free to navigate.
98490,L535305,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Go, Sulu!"
98491,L535304,u2928,m192,SULU,"If I read this right, sir, we have full power."
98492,L535246,u2918,m192,KIRK,Come on!
98493,L535245,u2928,m192,SULU,Close... There --
98494,L535244,u2918,m192,KIRK,What about surface life signs...?
98495,L535243,u2928,m192,SULU,"Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly..."
98496,L535214,u2918,m192,KIRK,With some on the planet...
98497,L535213,u2928,m192,SULU,About a dozen officers and men.
98498,L535212,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?"
98499,L535151,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Fire, Mr. Scott!"
98500,L535150,u2928,m192,SULU,"Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!"
98501,L535139,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Red alert, Mr. Scott."
98502,L535138,u2928,m192,SULU,... A cloaking device?
98503,L535137,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?"
98504,L535136,u2928,m192,SULU,"I think it's an energy form, sir..."
98505,L535135,u2918,m192,KIRK,"That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?"
98506,L535131,u2928,m192,SULU,"Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in."
98507,L535130,u2918,m192,KIRK,See! That shimmering area.
98508,L535091,u2918,m192,KIRK,"What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?"
98509,L535090,u2928,m192,SULU,We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
98510,L535072,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?"
98511,L535071,u2928,m192,SULU,"Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed."
98512,L535050,u2918,m192,KIRK,Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
98513,L535049,u2928,m192,SULU,"Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space."
98514,L535045,u2928,m192,SULU,"Aye, sir, Warp Speed..."
98515,L535044,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu..."
98516,L535035,u2918,m192,KIRK,FULL IMPULSE POWER!
98517,L535034,u2928,m192,SULU,... We have cleared Spacedoors.
98518,L534873,u2918,m192,KIRK,"I'll need it, Sulu."
98519,L534872,u2928,m192,SULU,"Count on our help, sir."
98520,L534871,u2918,m192,KIRK,The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
98521,L534870,u2928,m192,SULU,"The word, sir?"
98522,L534786,u2918,m192,KIRK,She's to be decommissioned.
98523,L534785,u2928,m192,SULU,"... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?"
98524,L534621,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please."
98525,L534620,u2928,m192,SULU,"On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours."
98526,L535006,u2930,m192,UHURA,"Oh, I'll have ""Mr. Adventure"" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes."
98527,L535005,u2918,m192,KIRK,Will you be able to handle that...?
98528,L534995,u2930,m192,UHURA,"Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor."
98529,L534994,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?"
98530,L534993,u2930,m192,UHURA,Gentlemen. Good evening.
98531,L534790,u2918,m192,KIRK,"That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see."
98532,L534789,u2930,m192,UHURA,"How is Doctor McCoy, sir?"
98533,L534703,u2918,m192,KIRK,"My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs..."
98534,L534702,u2930,m192,UHURA,Would you look at that?
98535,L534694,u2930,m192,UHURA,Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
98536,L534693,u2918,m192,KIRK,Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
98537,L534625,u2918,m192,KIRK,Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
98538,L534624,u2930,m192,UHURA,"No, sir, no response."
98539,L534623,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?"
98540,L534869,u2922,m192,MORROW,Any time.
98541,L534868,u2918,m192,KIRK,You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
98542,L534867,u2922,m192,MORROW,"Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away."
98543,L534866,u2918,m192,KIRK,Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
98544,L534864,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!"
98545,L534863,u2922,m192,MORROW,Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
98546,L534862,u2918,m192,KIRK,Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
98547,L534861,u2922,m192,MORROW,"No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding."
98548,L534860,u2918,m192,KIRK,"As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help..."
98549,L534859,u2922,m192,MORROW,Yours...?!
98550,L534858,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility."
98551,L534857,u2922,m192,MORROW,"Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?"
98552,L534856,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --"
98553,L534855,u2922,m192,MORROW,"Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!"
98554,L534747,u2922,m192,MORROW,"Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject."
98555,L534746,u2918,m192,KIRK,May I ask why...?
98556,L534745,u2922,m192,MORROW,That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
98557,L534744,u2918,m192,KIRK,Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
98558,L534743,u2922,m192,MORROW,Genesis?! Whatever for?
98559,L534742,u2918,m192,KIRK,"But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis..."
98560,L534741,u2922,m192,MORROW,"Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over..."
98561,L534740,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --"
98562,L534734,u2922,m192,MORROW,"Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves."
98563,L534733,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Indisposed, sir."
98564,L534732,u2922,m192,MORROW,Where's Doctor McCoy?
98565,L534728,u2922,m192,MORROW,"Welcome home, Jim."
98566,L534727,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Welcome aboard, Admiral."
98567,L535289,u2918,m192,KIRK,Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
98568,L535288,u2919,m192,KRUGE,
98569,L535287,u2918,m192,KIRK,Give me your hand and we both live.
98570,L535285,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
98571,L535284,u2918,m192,KIRK,"If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!"
98572,L535283,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!"
98573,L535282,u2918,m192,KIRK,You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
98574,L535281,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
98575,L535280,u2918,m192,KIRK,Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
98576,L535279,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"Genesis, I want it."
98577,L535278,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Because you wish it.
98578,L535277,u2918,m192,KIRK,"But, why?"
98579,L535276,u2919,m192,KRUGE,No.
98580,L535275,u2918,m192,KIRK,"You should take the Vulcan, too."
98581,L535274,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
98582,L535219,u2918,m192,KIRK,No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
98583,L535218,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute."
98584,L535217,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal."
98585,L535208,u2918,m192,KIRK,"All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew."
98586,L535207,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!"
98587,L535203,u2919,m192,KRUGE,
98588,L535202,u2918,m192,KIRK,Wait! Give me a chance --
98589,L535201,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners."
98590,L535200,u2918,m192,KIRK,David?... David!
98591,L535187,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
98592,L535186,u2918,m192,KIRK,Who is this?! How dare you --
98593,L535185,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace."
98594,L535164,u2918,m192,KIRK,Torpedoes coming in -- !
98595,L535163,u2919,m192,KRUGE,
98596,L535117,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Report status!
98597,L535116,u2918,m192,KIRK,"I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!"
98598,L535352,u2918,m192,KIRK,"If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul."
98599,L535351,u2924,m192,SAREK,But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
98600,L535350,u2918,m192,KIRK,"What I have done, I had to do."
98601,L535349,u2924,m192,SAREK,I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
98602,L535348,u2918,m192,KIRK,What about Spock?
98603,L534842,u2924,m192,SAREK,"You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>."
98604,L534841,u2918,m192,KIRK,What you ask is difficult.
98605,L534840,u2924,m192,SAREK,You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
98606,L534839,u2918,m192,KIRK,What must I do?
98607,L534838,u2924,m192,SAREK,"One alive, one not. Yet both in pain."
98608,L534837,u2918,m192,KIRK,Bones!...
98609,L534826,u2918,m192,KIRK,Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
98610,L534825,u2924,m192,SAREK,Yes... But -- how...?
98611,L534824,u2918,m192,KIRK,Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
98612,L534823,u2924,m192,SAREK,"I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn."
98613,L534822,u2918,m192,KIRK,But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
98614,L534821,u2924,m192,SAREK,Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
98615,L534820,u2918,m192,KIRK,"... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes."
98616,L534819,u2924,m192,SAREK,I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
98617,L534818,u2918,m192,KIRK,... Spock...
98618,L534817,u2924,m192,SAREK,... Or the one.
98619,L534816,u2918,m192,KIRK,... The needs of the few...
98620,L534815,u2924,m192,SAREK,... The needs of the many outweigh...
98621,L534814,u2918,m192,KIRK,... Yes...
98622,L534813,u2924,m192,SAREK,He asked you not to grieve...
98623,L534812,u2918,m192,KIRK,Yes...
98624,L534811,u2924,m192,SAREK,... He spoke of your friendship.
98625,L534810,u2918,m192,KIRK,Of course...!
98626,L534809,u2924,m192,SAREK,"Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?"
98627,L534808,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Then, how --"
98628,L534807,u2924,m192,SAREK,He would not have spoken of it openly.
98629,L534806,u2918,m192,KIRK,Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
98630,L534805,u2924,m192,SAREK,Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
98631,L534804,u2918,m192,KIRK,But -- why?
98632,L534803,u2924,m192,SAREK,Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
98633,L534802,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Yes, I was..."
98634,L534801,u2924,m192,SAREK,"You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was ""in death,"" Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him."
98635,L534800,u2918,m192,KIRK,I -- saw no future --
98636,L534799,u2924,m192,SAREK,"""Met his death""?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!"
98637,L534798,u2918,m192,KIRK,Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
98638,L534797,u2924,m192,SAREK,"Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report."
98639,L534796,u2918,m192,KIRK,Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
98640,L534794,u2924,m192,SAREK,"I will speak with you alone, Kirk."
98641,L534793,u2918,m192,KIRK,"Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew..."
98642,L535211,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!"
98643,L535210,u2929,m192,TORG,"They outnumber us, my Lord --"
98644,L535209,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!"
98645,L535184,u2919,m192,KRUGE,I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
98646,L535183,u2929,m192,TORG,How can you tell that?
98647,L535176,u2919,m192,KRUGE,They know we would die first.
98648,L535175,u2929,m192,TORG,Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
98649,L535174,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there."
98650,L535119,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
98651,L535118,u2929,m192,TORG,"We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams."
98652,L535108,u2929,m192,TORG,But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
98653,L535107,u2919,m192,KRUGE,I ordered no interruptions.
98654,L534930,u2929,m192,TORG,"I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek."
98655,L534929,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!"
98656,L534928,u2929,m192,TORG,"Sir, may I suggest --"
98657,L534761,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Station!
98658,L534760,u2929,m192,TORG,"Success, my lord."
98659,L534759,u2919,m192,KRUGE,"We are going to this ""planet."" Even as our emissaries negotiate for ""peace"" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!"
98660,L534758,u2929,m192,TORG,"Understood, my lord."
98661,L534757,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Share this with no one.
98662,L534750,u2929,m192,TORG,Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
98663,L534749,u2919,m192,KRUGE,So!  Speak!
98664,L535254,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
98665,L535253,u2921,m192,MALTZ,"But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?"
98666,L535252,u2919,m192,KRUGE,They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
98667,L535251,u2921,m192,MALTZ,"We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --"
98668,L535250,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
98669,L535249,u2921,m192,MALTZ,"Sir, may I --"
98670,L535248,u2919,m192,KRUGE,I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
98671,L535247,u2921,m192,MALTZ,My Lord... what are your orders?
98672,L535178,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Put him on screen!  Study him well.
98673,L535177,u2921,m192,MALTZ,"My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer."
98674,L535148,u2919,m192,KRUGE,
98675,L535147,u2921,m192,MALTZ,500 Kellicams!
98676,L535141,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Wait!... Wait...
98677,L535140,u2921,m192,MALTZ,"1,000 Kellicams, closing!"
98678,L535133,u2919,m192,KRUGE,
98679,L535132,u2921,m192,MALTZ,"Firing range, sir."
98680,L535123,u2919,m192,KRUGE,Steady. Continue on impulse power.
98681,L535122,u2921,m192,MALTZ,Range: 3000 Kellicams.
98682,L534668,u2921,m192,MALTZ,"Yes, my lord!"
98683,L534667,u2919,m192,KRUGE,I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
98684,L535003,u2930,m192,UHURA,This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
98685,L535002,u2920,m192,LIEUTENANT,The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
98686,L535001,u2930,m192,UHURA,I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
98687,L535000,u2920,m192,LIEUTENANT,Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
98688,L534999,u2930,m192,UHURA,All true.
98689,L534998,u2920,m192,LIEUTENANT,"But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d..."
98690,L534997,u2930,m192,UHURA,"Good for you, Lieutenant."
98691,L534996,u2920,m192,LIEUTENANT,"Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!"
98692,L534992,u2930,m192,UHURA,"You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it."
98693,L534991,u2920,m192,LIEUTENANT,"Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two."
98694,L534990,u2930,m192,UHURA,"Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant."
98695,L534989,u2920,m192,LIEUTENANT,"A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space."
98696,L534988,u2930,m192,UHURA,How is that...?
98697,L534987,u2920,m192,LIEUTENANT,"You amaze me, Commander."
98698,L534505,u2943,m193,SPOCK,I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
98699,L534504,u2932,m193,BONES,You're not going in there -- !
98700,L534503,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human."
98701,L534502,u2932,m193,BONES,Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
98702,L534064,u2932,m193,BONES,"Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?"
98703,L534063,u2943,m193,SPOCK,I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
98704,L534062,u2932,m193,BONES,"Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --"
98705,L534061,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --"
98706,L534060,u2932,m193,BONES,It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
98707,L534059,u2943,m193,SPOCK,It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
98708,L534058,u2932,m193,BONES,"But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?"
98709,L534582,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Young. I feel young, Doctor."
98710,L534581,u2932,m193,BONES,"You okay, Jim? How do you feel?"
98711,L534401,u2932,m193,BONES,I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
98712,L534400,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --"
98713,L534388,u2938,m193,KIRK,"We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik."
98714,L534387,u2932,m193,BONES,Until now.
98715,L534381,u2938,m193,KIRK,And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
98716,L534380,u2932,m193,BONES,"Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --"
98717,L534372,u2932,m193,BONES,It's like the Garden of Eden...
98718,L534371,u2938,m193,KIRK,Now that's what I call a meal.
98719,L534336,u2938,m193,KIRK,Our first order of business is survival.
98720,L534335,u2932,m193,BONES,How can you think of food at a time like this?
98721,L534334,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved."
98722,L534272,u2938,m193,KIRK,Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
98723,L534271,u2932,m193,BONES,But what if they went -- nowhere?
98724,L534270,u2938,m193,KIRK,Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
98725,L534269,u2932,m193,BONES,Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
98726,L534224,u2932,m193,BONES,"This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim."
98727,L534223,u2938,m193,KIRK,They even killed the galley chief.
98728,L534213,u2932,m193,BONES,I can spare me...
98729,L534212,u2938,m193,KIRK,He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
98730,L534211,u2932,m193,BONES,Khan could be down there!
98731,L534194,u2938,m193,KIRK,I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
98732,L534193,u2932,m193,BONES,There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
98733,L534192,u2938,m193,KIRK,At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
98734,L534191,u2932,m193,BONES,Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
98735,L534040,u2938,m193,KIRK,Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
98736,L534039,u2932,m193,BONES,I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
98737,L533983,u2938,m193,KIRK,As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
98738,L533982,u2932,m193,BONES,It never rains but when it pours --
98739,L533886,u2938,m193,KIRK,"The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor."
98740,L533885,u2932,m193,BONES,"What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?"
98741,L533861,u2938,m193,KIRK,Ah.
98742,L533860,u2932,m193,BONES,"Shore leave, Admiral."
98743,L533791,u2932,m193,BONES,"I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection."
98744,L533790,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think."
98745,L533789,u2932,m193,BONES,"From yourself, Admiral."
98746,L533788,u2938,m193,KIRK,And who am I hiding from?
98747,L533787,u2932,m193,BONES,Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
98748,L533786,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and..."
98749,L533785,u2932,m193,BONES,"What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies."
98750,L533784,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Bones, I don't want to be lectured."
98751,L533783,u2932,m193,BONES,"Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?"
98752,L533782,u2938,m193,KIRK,Thank you.
98753,L533781,u2932,m193,BONES,Say thank you.
98754,L533780,u2938,m193,KIRK,Amazing! I don't know what to say --
98755,L533779,u2932,m193,BONES,Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
98756,L533778,u2932,m193,BONES,Exactly. Happy birthday.
98757,L533777,u2938,m193,KIRK,But I'm allergic to Retlax.
98758,L533776,u2932,m193,BONES,"For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens."
98759,L533775,u2938,m193,KIRK,Uh -- what are they?
98760,L533774,u2932,m193,BONES,Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
98761,L533773,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Cheers. Bones, these are... charming."
98762,L533772,u2932,m193,BONES,More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
98763,L533771,u2938,m193,KIRK,"I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --"
98764,L533769,u2932,m193,BONES,Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
98765,L533768,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Twenty-two, eighty-three..."
98766,L533767,u2932,m193,BONES,I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
98767,L533766,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --"
98768,L533765,u2932,m193,BONES,'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
98769,L533764,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?"
98770,L533717,u2938,m193,KIRK,"They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor."
98771,L533716,u2932,m193,BONES,Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
98772,L533704,u2938,m193,KIRK,I'm not a drama critic.
98773,L533703,u2932,m193,BONES,That's all you have to say?
98774,L533702,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Physician, heal thyself."
98775,L533939,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out."
98776,L533938,u2933,m193,CAROL,"This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials."
98777,L533934,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,I have my orders.
98778,L533933,u2933,m193,CAROL,"But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --"
98779,L533932,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff."
98780,L533931,u2933,m193,CAROL,"<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?"
98781,L533930,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI."
98782,L533929,u2933,m193,CAROL,I still don't under --
98783,L533928,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
98784,L533927,u2933,m193,CAROL,En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
98785,L533926,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
98786,L533925,u2933,m193,CAROL,"Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead."
98787,L533924,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --"
98788,L534580,u2938,m193,KIRK,Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
98789,L534579,u2933,m193,CAROL,Is that a poem?
98790,L534578,u2938,m193,KIRK,It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
98791,L534358,u2933,m193,CAROL,The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
98792,L534357,u2938,m193,KIRK,You did this -- in a day?!
98793,L534349,u2933,m193,CAROL,"How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father."
98794,L534348,u2938,m193,KIRK,Why? Why didn't you tell me?
98795,L534347,u2933,m193,CAROL,"David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy."
98796,L534049,u2933,m193,CAROL,Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
98797,L534048,u2938,m193,KIRK,Wait --
98798,L533997,u2933,m193,CAROL,Jim please --
98799,L533996,u2938,m193,KIRK,Carol!
98800,L533995,u2933,m193,CAROL,"... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority..."
98801,L533994,u2938,m193,KIRK,What order? Who's taking Genesis?
98802,L533993,u2933,m193,CAROL,... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
98803,L533992,u2938,m193,KIRK,Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
98804,L533991,u2933,m193,CAROL,... taking Genesis away from us...
98805,L533990,u2938,m193,KIRK,Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
98806,L533989,u2933,m193,CAROL,... Can't read you... repeat...
98807,L533988,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?"
98808,L533987,u2933,m193,CAROL,Jim... read me? Can you read me?
98809,L534343,u2935,m193,DAVID,"This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on."
98810,L534342,u2933,m193,CAROL,David. Please.
98811,L534340,u2935,m193,DAVID,But we can't just sit here -- !
98812,L534339,u2933,m193,CAROL,"This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food."
98813,L534328,u2933,m193,CAROL,I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
98814,L534327,u2935,m193,DAVID,"So are we, it looks like."
98815,L534285,u2933,m193,CAROL,You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
98816,L534284,u2935,m193,DAVID,Go back. I'm going to kill him.
98817,L534283,u2933,m193,CAROL,Jim --
98818,L534282,u2935,m193,DAVID,"Mother, go back!"
98819,L534281,u2933,m193,CAROL,David --
98820,L533948,u2933,m193,CAROL,"Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event."
98821,L533947,u2935,m193,DAVID,I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
98822,L533944,u2935,m193,DAVID,"Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa."
98823,L533943,u2933,m193,CAROL,Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
98824,L533921,u2935,m193,DAVID,Who --
98825,L533920,u2933,m193,CAROL,"I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one."
98826,L533919,u2935,m193,DAVID,Does that about do it?
98827,L533761,u2935,m193,DAVID,"Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --"
98828,L533760,u2933,m193,CAROL,Maybe...
98829,L533759,u2935,m193,DAVID,Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
98830,L533758,u2933,m193,CAROL,Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
98831,L533757,u2935,m193,DAVID,"Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak..."
98832,L533756,u2933,m193,CAROL,"I know, I know..."
98833,L533755,u2935,m193,DAVID,"Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life..."
98834,L533754,u2933,m193,CAROL,And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
98835,L533753,u2935,m193,DAVID,How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
98836,L534249,u2946,m193,TERRELL,"Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife..."
98837,L534248,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
98838,L533818,u2946,m193,TERRELL,What do you want with us? I demand --
98839,L533817,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --"
98840,L533810,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,Never mind! Hurry!
98841,L533809,u2946,m193,TERRELL,But the child --
98842,L533807,u2946,m193,TERRELL,What's the matter -- ?
98843,L533806,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
98844,L533805,u2946,m193,TERRELL,Ssssh!
98845,L533804,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,I told you! I told you I saw a --
98846,L533801,u2946,m193,TERRELL,There's an air-lock.
98847,L533800,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,I saw it -- !
98848,L533799,u2946,m193,TERRELL,You're crazy -- !
98849,L533794,u2946,m193,TERRELL,I can hardly see --
98850,L533793,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --"
98851,L533792,u2946,m193,TERRELL,Are you sure these are the coordinates?
98852,L533748,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,You know what she'll say...
98853,L533747,u2946,m193,TERRELL,"All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant."
98854,L533746,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
98855,L533745,u2946,m193,TERRELL,Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
98856,L533744,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
98857,L533743,u2946,m193,TERRELL,Don't tell me you've got something.
98858,L533942,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order."
98859,L533941,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Well done, Commander."
98860,L533915,u2937,m193,KHAN,I see. Helmsman?
98861,L533914,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I."
98862,L533913,u2937,m193,KHAN,Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
98863,L533912,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff."
98864,L533911,u2937,m193,KHAN,Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
98865,L533910,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information."
98866,L533835,u2937,m193,KHAN,"There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife."
98867,L533834,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --"
98868,L533827,u2937,m193,KHAN,"And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!"
98869,L533826,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
98870,L533825,u2937,m193,KHAN,"<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails."
98871,L533824,u2934,m193,CHEKOV,"You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --"
98872,L534567,u2935,m193,DAVID,Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
98873,L534566,u2938,m193,KIRK,Is that what you came here to say?
98874,L534565,u2935,m193,DAVID,I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
98875,L534564,u2938,m193,KIRK,I am truly sorry.
98876,L534563,u2935,m193,DAVID,"So am I. My friends were killed, too."
98877,L534562,u2938,m193,KIRK,"I'm trying, David."
98878,L534561,u2935,m193,DAVID,But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
98879,L534560,u2938,m193,KIRK,It was just words.
98880,L534559,u2935,m193,DAVID,You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
98881,L534558,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing."
98882,L534557,u2935,m193,DAVID,That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
98883,L534556,u2938,m193,KIRK,I didn't expect anything.
98884,L534555,u2935,m193,DAVID,No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
98885,L534554,u2938,m193,KIRK,I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
98886,L534553,u2935,m193,DAVID,Are you running away from me?
98887,L534552,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge."
98888,L534551,u2935,m193,DAVID,I don't mean to intrude.
98889,L534496,u2935,m193,DAVID,You can't!
98890,L534495,u2938,m193,KIRK,We'll beam aboard and stop it --
98891,L534494,u2935,m193,DAVID,We encoded four minutes --
98892,L534493,u2938,m193,KIRK,How soon --
98893,L534492,u2935,m193,DAVID,He's on a build up to detonation!
98894,L534491,u2938,m193,KIRK,What?
98895,L534490,u2935,m193,DAVID,It's the Genesis Wave!
98896,L534330,u2935,m193,DAVID,We appear to have plenty of time.
98897,L534329,u2938,m193,KIRK,It's a long story.
98898,L534290,u2935,m193,DAVID,She's making it up! My father was Professor --
98899,L534289,u2938,m193,KIRK,Why didn't you tell me?
98900,L534280,u2935,m193,DAVID,I'm Doctor Marcus!
98901,L534279,u2938,m193,KIRK,Where's Dr. Marcus --
98902,L534278,u2935,m193,DAVID,"<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --"
98903,L534277,u2938,m193,KIRK,I'm Admiral Kirk...
98904,L534370,u2935,m193,DAVID,I don't know.
98905,L534369,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,What are <u>you</u> looking at?
98906,L534368,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Oh, I believe it."
98907,L534367,u2935,m193,DAVID,Don't you believe it.
98908,L534366,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,The Admiral's son.
98909,L534365,u2935,m193,DAVID,What are you looking at?
98910,L534313,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Only half of you would get there.
98911,L534312,u2935,m193,DAVID,Let go -- he can't -- !
98912,L534462,u2937,m193,KHAN,I shall avenge you --
98913,L534461,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,Yours... is... the superior...
98914,L534451,u2937,m193,KHAN,Raise the shields...
98915,L534450,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,Inoperative.
98916,L534449,u2937,m193,KHAN,Tactical!
98917,L534446,u2937,m193,KHAN,<u>Full power damn you</u>!
98918,L534445,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
98919,L534426,u2937,m193,KHAN,Rake her.
98920,L534425,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,We'll lose them if they go in there.
98921,L534363,u2937,m193,KHAN,Visual --
98922,L534362,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,"Departing dark side, Regula."
98923,L534320,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
98924,L534319,u2937,m193,KHAN,Well?
98925,L534172,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,"Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere."
98926,L534171,u2937,m193,KHAN,No!
98927,L534170,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,"We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!"
98928,L534169,u2937,m193,KHAN,At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
98929,L534167,u2937,m193,KHAN,<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
98930,L534166,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,They won't --
98931,L534165,u2937,m193,KHAN,Raise them --
98932,L534164,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,Sir -- our shields are dropping!
98933,L534099,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,Locking phasers on target.
98934,L534098,u2937,m193,KHAN,Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
98935,L534086,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space."
98936,L534085,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,They're still running with shields down.
98937,L534084,u2937,m193,KHAN,Let them eat static.
98938,L534083,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,"They're requesting visual communications, sir."
98939,L533909,u2937,m193,KHAN,"It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?"
98940,L533908,u2936,m193,JOACHIM,Steady on course. All systems normal.
98941,L534318,u2938,m193,KIRK,KHAN!
98942,L534317,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens."
98943,L534311,u2937,m193,KHAN,Perhaps I no longer need to try.
98944,L534310,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target."
98945,L534309,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend..."
98946,L534163,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Here it comes. Now, Spock."
98947,L534162,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Time's up, Admiral..."
98948,L534159,u2938,m193,KIRK,I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
98949,L534158,u2937,m193,KHAN,"I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative."
98950,L534157,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?"
98951,L534154,u2938,m193,KIRK,"... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields..."
98952,L534153,u2937,m193,KHAN,Thirty seconds...
98953,L534140,u2937,m193,KHAN,"I give you sixty seconds, Admiral."
98954,L534139,u2938,m193,KIRK,Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
98955,L534138,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --"
98956,L534137,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Genesis, what's that?"
98957,L534135,u2937,m193,KHAN,"That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think."
98958,L534134,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew."
98959,L534133,u2937,m193,KHAN,"-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever."
98960,L534132,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --"
98961,L534131,u2938,m193,KIRK,What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
98962,L534130,u2937,m193,KHAN,"You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you."
98963,L534302,u2937,m193,KHAN,"First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk."
98964,L534301,u2946,m193,TERRELL,"All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis..."
98965,L534300,u2937,m193,KHAN,Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
98966,L533823,u2937,m193,KHAN,Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
98967,L533822,u2946,m193,TERRELL,I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
98968,L533821,u2937,m193,KHAN,"Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?"
98969,L533820,u2946,m193,TERRELL,Listen to me -- you men and women --
98970,L533819,u2937,m193,KHAN,"You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk."
98971,L533816,u2946,m193,TERRELL,"Chekov, who is this man?"
98972,L533815,u2937,m193,KHAN,"I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again."
98973,L534482,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded."
98974,L534481,u2942,m193,SCOTTY'S VOICE,"I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates."
98975,L534210,u2938,m193,KIRK,I'm going down to the station.
98976,L534209,u2942,m193,SCOTTY'S VOICE,"Just barely, sir."
98977,L534121,u2942,m193,SCOTTY'S VOICE,"A few shots, sir."
98978,L534120,u2938,m193,KIRK,We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
98979,L534119,u2942,m193,SCOTTY'S VOICE,"Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --"
98980,L534118,u2938,m193,KIRK,Scotty -- what's left?
98981,L534006,u2942,m193,SCOTTY'S VOICE,"Aye, sir --"
98982,L534005,u2938,m193,KIRK,We'll be going to warp speed --
98983,L534004,u2942,m193,SCOTTY'S VOICE,"Aye, sir."
98984,L534003,u2938,m193,KIRK,"An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?"
98985,L534488,u2938,m193,KIRK,We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
98986,L534487,u2947,m193,UHURA,"Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir."
98987,L534231,u2947,m193,UHURA,I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
98988,L534230,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right."
98989,L534200,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Sensors, Captain?"
98990,L534199,u2947,m193,UHURA,"... No response, sir."
98991,L534127,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Do it, while we have time."
98992,L534126,u2947,m193,UHURA,Admiral --
98993,L534125,u2938,m193,KIRK,On screen.
98994,L534110,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Scotty, let's have it."
98995,L534109,u2947,m193,UHURA,Mr. Scott on discrete.
98996,L534095,u2938,m193,KIRK,Spock?
98997,L534094,u2947,m193,UHURA,I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
98998,L534076,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Picture, Mr. Saavik."
98999,L534075,u2947,m193,UHURA,"Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant."
99000,L534074,u2938,m193,KIRK,Try the emergency channels...
99001,L534073,u2947,m193,UHURA,She's not responding...
99002,L533986,u2947,m193,UHURA,"I'm trying, sir. Stand by..."
99003,L533985,u2938,m193,KIRK,Uhura. Can't you augment?
99004,L534524,u2938,m193,KIRK,He'll die -- !
99005,L534523,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,"No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!"
99006,L534465,u2938,m193,KIRK,"All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power."
99007,L534464,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,"Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --"
99008,L534414,u2938,m193,KIRK,"No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way."
99009,L534413,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
99010,L534180,u2938,m193,KIRK,He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
99011,L534179,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,<u>WHY</u>?
99012,L533884,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,"Aye, sir."
99013,L533883,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Mr. Scott, the word is given."
99014,L533882,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,"Give the word, Admiral."
99015,L533881,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?"
99016,L533880,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,"My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space."
99017,L533879,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Midshipman, you're a tiger."
99018,L533859,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?"
99019,L533858,u2941,m193,SCOTTY,I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
99020,L533857,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?"
99021,L534390,u2944,m193,SPOCK'S VOICE,"Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard."
99022,L534389,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?"
99023,L534263,u2944,m193,SPOCK'S VOICE,Not at present.
99024,L534262,u2938,m193,KIRK,Meaning you can't even beam us back?
99025,L534260,u2938,m193,KIRK,"I read you, Captain. Let's have it."
99026,L534259,u2944,m193,SPOCK'S VOICE,"Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days."
99027,L534258,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?"
99028,L534187,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?"
99029,L534186,u2944,m193,SPOCK'S VOICE,Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
99030,L534185,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Yes, Spock."
99031,L534184,u2944,m193,SPOCK'S VOICE,"Admiral, this is Spock."
99032,L534183,u2938,m193,KIRK,"If he hadn't, we'd be space by now."
99033,L534178,u2939,m193,PRESTON,Aye...
99034,L534177,u2938,m193,KIRK,The word is given: warp speed.
99035,L534176,u2939,m193,PRESTON,Is the word given?
99036,L533877,u2939,m193,PRESTON,"Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --"
99037,L533876,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?"
99038,L533875,u2939,m193,PRESTON,"I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral."
99039,L533866,u2938,m193,KIRK,"I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?"
99040,L533865,u2939,m193,PRESTON,"Yes, SIR."
99041,L533864,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?"
99042,L533863,u2939,m193,PRESTON,"Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR."
99043,L533862,u2938,m193,KIRK,And who is this?
99044,L534535,u2943,m193,SPOCK,I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
99045,L534534,u2938,m193,KIRK,Spock...!
99046,L534533,u2943,m193,SPOCK,I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
99047,L534532,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Or the one.
99048,L534531,u2938,m193,KIRK,... the good of the few...
99049,L534529,u2938,m193,KIRK,Yes --
99050,L534528,u2943,m193,SPOCK,The ship -- out of danger?
99051,L534527,u2938,m193,KIRK,Spock!
99052,L534471,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking..."
99053,L534470,u2938,m193,KIRK,He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
99054,L534469,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn."
99055,L534437,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Uhura, patch me in --"
99056,L534436,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Admiral, they're reducing speed."
99057,L534424,u2938,m193,KIRK,Steady as you go...
99058,L534423,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
99059,L534421,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Best speed, Scotty..."
99060,L534420,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego."
99061,L534412,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Scotty, can we make it inside?"
99062,L534411,u2943,m193,SPOCK,She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
99063,L534410,u2938,m193,KIRK,Uh oh.
99064,L534406,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Best we could do in two hours.
99065,L534405,u2938,m193,KIRK,That's it?
99066,L534404,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power..."
99067,L534403,u2938,m193,KIRK,What IS working around here?
99068,L534219,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Be careful, Jim..."
99069,L534218,u2938,m193,KIRK,Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
99070,L534217,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Aye sir --
99071,L534216,u2938,m193,KIRK,"All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours."
99072,L534208,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?"
99073,L534207,u2943,m193,SPOCK,A distinct possibility.
99074,L534206,u2938,m193,KIRK,Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
99075,L534205,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Regula is class ""D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space."
99076,L534204,u2938,m193,KIRK,... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
99077,L534203,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Affirmative, Admiral."
99078,L534202,u2938,m193,KIRK,And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
99079,L534201,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
99080,L534156,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again."
99081,L534155,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
99082,L534152,u2943,m193,SPOCK,The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
99083,L534151,u2938,m193,KIRK,"You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan..."
99084,L534146,u2938,m193,KIRK,It's all we've got.
99085,L534145,u2943,m193,SPOCK,The prefix code?
99086,L534142,u2938,m193,KIRK,"At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry..."
99087,L534141,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Admiral, you can't give him Genesis..."
99088,L534123,u2938,m193,KIRK,Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
99089,L534122,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Not enough against their shields.
99090,L534116,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Too late --
99091,L534115,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --"
99092,L534114,u2943,m193,SPOCK,One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
99093,L534113,u2938,m193,KIRK,WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
99094,L534112,u2943,m193,SPOCK,They knew just where to hit us.
99095,L534101,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --"
99096,L534100,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
99097,L534080,u2943,m193,SPOCK,It would explain a great many things --
99098,L534079,u2938,m193,KIRK,Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
99099,L534072,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?"
99100,L534071,u2943,m193,SPOCK,What's she doing here?
99101,L534066,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --"
99102,L534065,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Gentlemen, this isn't --"
99103,L534057,u2938,m193,KIRK,The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
99104,L534056,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Have they proceeded with their experiments?
99105,L534055,u2938,m193,KIRK,The power of creation --
99106,L534054,u2943,m193,SPOCK,It literally is Genesis...
99107,L534045,u2938,m193,KIRK,Yes.
99108,L534044,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Carol Marcus --
99109,L534037,u2943,m193,SPOCK,It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
99110,L534036,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?"
99111,L534035,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed."
99112,L534034,u2938,m193,KIRK,How far?
99113,L534033,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond."
99114,L534028,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets."
99115,L534027,u2938,m193,KIRK,Will you accompany me to the bridge?
99116,L534025,u2938,m193,KIRK,Or the one.
99117,L534024,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
99118,L534023,u2938,m193,KIRK,I would not presume to debate you.
99119,L534022,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material."
99120,L534021,u2938,m193,KIRK,You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
99121,L534020,u2943,m193,SPOCK,You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
99122,L534019,u2938,m193,KIRK,But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
99123,L534018,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command."
99124,L534017,u2938,m193,KIRK,That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
99125,L534016,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours."
99126,L534015,u2938,m193,KIRK,I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
99127,L534014,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves..."
99128,L534013,u2938,m193,KIRK,Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
99129,L533898,u2938,m193,KIRK,"To be sure, Captain."
99130,L533897,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"There's a first time for everything, Admiral."
99131,L533856,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Yes, we've been through death and life together."
99132,L533855,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you."
99133,L533854,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Permission to come aboard, Captain?"
99134,L533734,u2938,m193,KIRK,Home.
99135,L533733,u2943,m193,SPOCK,The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
99136,L533732,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?"
99137,L533731,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times."
99138,L533730,u2938,m193,KIRK,"'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?"
99139,L533729,u2943,m193,SPOCK,I know of your fondness for antiques.
99140,L533728,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this."
99141,L533727,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example."
99142,L533726,u2938,m193,KIRK,"So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --"
99143,L533725,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
99144,L533724,u2938,m193,KIRK,It had the virtue of never having been tried.
99145,L533723,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?"
99146,L533722,u2938,m193,KIRK,They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
99147,L533721,u2943,m193,SPOCK,I am understandably curious.
99148,L533720,u2938,m193,KIRK,I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
99149,L534266,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or..."
99150,L534265,u2948,m193,UHURA'S VOICE,Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
99151,L534264,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range."
99152,L534000,u2938,m193,KIRK,Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
99153,L533999,u2948,m193,UHURA'S VOICE,"Transmission jammed at the source, sir."
99154,L533998,u2938,m193,KIRK,Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
99155,L533981,u2948,m193,UHURA'S VOICE,"Yes, sir."
99156,L533980,u2938,m193,KIRK,"In my quarters, Uhura."
99157,L533979,u2948,m193,UHURA'S VOICE,I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
99158,L533978,u2938,m193,KIRK,Kirk here.
99159,L534573,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aye, sir --"
99160,L534572,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Yes, well, why don't you show him around and..."
99161,L534571,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --"
99162,L534570,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well."
99163,L534569,u2938,m193,KIRK,"As you were, Mr. Saavik."
99164,L534568,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Admiral on the bridge!
99165,L534549,u2938,m193,KIRK,Dismiss the company.
99166,L534548,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Understood, sir."
99167,L534547,u2938,m193,KIRK,"I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer..."
99168,L534546,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aye, sir."
99169,L534545,u2938,m193,KIRK,"After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors."
99170,L534515,u2938,m193,KIRK,Distance from Reliant...
99171,L534514,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Three minutes, thirty seconds."
99172,L534513,u2938,m193,KIRK,Time!
99173,L534509,u2938,m193,KIRK,Engine room! What's happening?!
99174,L534508,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Two minutes, ten seconds."
99175,L534507,u2938,m193,KIRK,Time from my mark...
99176,L534500,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aye, sir."
99177,L534499,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Saavik, get us out, best speed!"
99178,L534480,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?"
99179,L534479,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Power levels quite low, sir."
99180,L534478,u2938,m193,KIRK,Cease fire. Look sharp.
99181,L534474,u2938,m193,KIRK,Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
99182,L534473,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"All stop, sir."
99183,L534472,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Mr. Saavik, all stop."
99184,L534457,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,At what.
99185,L534456,u2938,m193,KIRK,Hold your course. Look sharp...
99186,L534434,u2938,m193,KIRK,They just don't want us going in there.
99187,L534433,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,That was close --
99188,L534397,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
99189,L534396,u2938,m193,KIRK,Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
99190,L534393,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus..."
99191,L534392,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
99192,L534386,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
99193,L534385,u2938,m193,KIRK,I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
99194,L534384,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,<u>WHAT</u>?
99195,L534383,u2938,m193,KIRK,I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
99196,L534382,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,How?
99197,L534379,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know."
99198,L534378,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?"
99199,L534375,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir."
99200,L534374,u2938,m193,KIRK,"What's on your mind, Lieutenant?"
99201,L534345,u2938,m193,KIRK,As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
99202,L534344,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Admiral?
99203,L534257,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Stage Two of what?
99204,L534256,u2938,m193,KIRK,"If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground."
99205,L534255,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
99206,L534245,u2938,m193,KIRK,Erased...
99207,L534244,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied."
99208,L534222,u2938,m193,KIRK,Phasers on stun. Move out.
99209,L534221,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Indeterminate life signs.
99210,L534215,u2938,m193,KIRK,There is no such regulation.
99211,L534214,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
99212,L534148,u2938,m193,KIRK,"We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative..."
99213,L534147,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,On screen...
99214,L534144,u2938,m193,KIRK,HURRY.
99215,L534143,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Reliant's command...
99216,L534129,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Who?
99217,L534128,u2938,m193,KIRK,Khan!
99218,L534093,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Energize defense fields.
99219,L534092,u2938,m193,KIRK,This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
99220,L533972,u2938,m193,KIRK,Take the test again.
99221,L533971,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Yes.
99222,L533969,u2938,m193,KIRK,"We learn by doing, Lieutenant."
99223,L533968,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
99224,L533967,u2938,m193,KIRK,That was a little joke.
99225,L533966,u2938,m193,KIRK,"You may ask, Lieutenant."
99226,L533965,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
99227,L533964,u2938,m193,KIRK,There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
99228,L533963,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,I failed to resolve the situation.
99229,L533962,u2938,m193,KIRK,You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
99230,L533961,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,I did not think so.
99231,L533960,u2938,m193,KIRK,You earned it.
99232,L533959,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
99233,L533958,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems."
99234,L533957,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"May I speak, sir?"
99235,L533956,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"It is still regulation, Admiral."
99236,L533955,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?"
99237,L533715,u2938,m193,KIRK,Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
99238,L533714,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me."
99239,L533713,u2938,m193,KIRK,"How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?"
99240,L533712,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"... No, sir. It has not."
99241,L533711,u2938,m193,KIRK,A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
99242,L533710,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Because... there was no way to win.
99243,L533709,u2938,m193,KIRK,And why not?
99244,L533708,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
99245,L533707,u2938,m193,KIRK,Very well.
99246,L533706,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Permission to speak candidly, sir?"
99247,L533705,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?"
99248,L533700,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain."
99249,L533699,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Any suggestions, Admiral?"
99250,L534454,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready."
99251,L534453,u2945,m193,SULU,"Phaser lock inoperative, sir."
99252,L534408,u2938,m193,KIRK,Battle stations.
99253,L534407,u2945,m193,SULU,Admiral on the bridge --
99254,L534196,u2938,m193,KIRK,Try again.
99255,L534195,u2945,m193,SULU,Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
99256,L534174,u2938,m193,KIRK,"<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --"
99257,L534173,u2945,m193,SULU,"Sir, you did it."
99258,L534161,u2945,m193,SULU,Phasers locked...
99259,L534160,u2938,m193,KIRK,"Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command..."
99260,L534107,u2938,m193,KIRK,Scotty!
99261,L534106,u2945,m193,SULU,"I can't get power, sir!"
99262,L534104,u2945,m193,SULU,"Trying, sir!"
99263,L534103,u2938,m193,KIRK,Mr. Sulu... The shields!
99264,L534088,u2938,m193,KIRK,Visual.
99265,L534087,u2945,m193,SULU,"Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --"
99266,L534008,u2938,m193,KIRK,Engage warp engines --
99267,L534007,u2945,m193,SULU,"Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral..."
99268,L534002,u2945,m193,SULU,Stop engines.
99269,L534001,u2938,m193,KIRK,Stop engines.
99270,L533850,u2938,m193,KIRK,You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
99271,L533849,u2945,m193,SULU,"Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time."
99272,L533848,u2938,m193,KIRK,"I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR."
99273,L533847,u2945,m193,SULU,"I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia."
99274,L533846,u2938,m193,KIRK,I really must thank you.
99275,L534542,u2945,m193,SULU,Honors -- hup!
99276,L534541,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
99277,L534010,u2945,m193,SULU,"Ready, sir."
99278,L534009,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Prepare for warp speed.
99279,L533905,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Course heading, Captain?"
99280,L533904,u2945,m193,SULU,We are clear and free to navigate.
99281,L533900,u2945,m193,SULU,"Aft thrusters, sir."
99282,L533899,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu."
99283,L533685,u2945,m193,SULU,"I'll try, Captain."
99284,L533684,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here."
99285,L533681,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
99286,L533680,u2945,m193,SULU,Shields activated!
99287,L533672,u2945,m193,SULU,... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
99288,L533671,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister."
99289,L533670,u2945,m193,SULU,May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
99290,L533655,u2945,m193,SULU,"Aye, Captain."
99291,L533654,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
99292,L533653,u2945,m193,SULU,Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
99293,L534399,u2943,m193,SPOCK,I exaggerated.
99294,L534398,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,You lied.
99295,L534395,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,By the book...
99296,L534394,u2943,m193,SPOCK,Certainly...
99297,L534091,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aye, sir."
99298,L534090,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations."
99299,L534089,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --"
99300,L533896,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aye, sir."
99301,L533895,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Take her out, Mr. Saavik."
99302,L533894,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Never, sir."
99303,L533893,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?"
99304,L533892,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Thank you, Mr. Saavik."
99305,L533891,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"All moorings are clear, Captain."
99306,L533890,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"Aye, sir."
99307,L533889,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings."
99308,L533873,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical."
99309,L533872,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,He's very human.
99310,L533871,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"What did you expect, Lieutenant?"
99311,L533870,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,"He's not what I expected, Sir."
99312,L533695,u2943,m193,SPOCK,"No power to the weapons system, sir."
99313,L533694,u2940,m193,SAAVIK,Fire all phasers...!
99314,L535439,u2949,m194,AMANDA,"... They do, indeed."
99315,L535438,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Humans make illogical decisions...
99316,L535437,u2949,m194,AMANDA,"Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them."
99317,L535436,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I would accept that as an axiom.
99318,L535435,u2949,m194,AMANDA,Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
99319,L535434,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"I do this because I was there,"
99320,L535433,u2949,m194,AMANDA,You do this -- for friendship?
99321,L535432,u2967,m194,SPOCK,To Earth. To offer testimony.
99322,L535431,u2949,m194,AMANDA,Where must you go?
99323,L535430,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them."
99324,L535429,u2949,m194,AMANDA,"Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface."
99325,L535428,u2967,m194,SPOCK,The question is irrelevant.
99326,L535427,u2949,m194,AMANDA,You are half human. The Computer knows that.
99327,L535426,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I do not understand the final question...
99328,L536022,u2950,m194,BOB,Gillian --
99329,L536021,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
99330,L535774,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Why don't I?
99331,L535773,u2950,m194,BOB,"Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?"
99332,L535772,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
99333,L535771,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either."
99334,L535770,u2950,m194,BOB,"And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --"
99335,L535769,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Yeah.
99336,L535768,u2950,m194,BOB,I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
99337,L535767,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Bob... it's tearing me apart.
99338,L535766,u2950,m194,BOB,"Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long."
99339,L535765,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Fine. Just fine.
99340,L535764,u2950,m194,BOB,How're you doing?
99341,L535763,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Just a couple of kooks...
99342,L535762,u2950,m194,BOB,Heard there was some excitement.
99343,L535880,u2951,m194,BONES,"A moment alone, please."
99344,L535879,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
99345,L535869,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,Please...
99346,L535868,u2951,m194,BONES,He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
99347,L535859,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
99348,L535858,u2951,m194,BONES,"Back home, we call him the miracle worker."
99349,L535857,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,"Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive."
99350,L535836,u2951,m194,BONES,"I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it."
99351,L535835,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,"Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?"
99352,L536268,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Not me, Bones... They did it."
99353,L536267,u2951,m194,BONES,"Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth."
99354,L536105,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank..."
99355,L536104,u2951,m194,BONES,"He's coming 'round, Jim..."
99356,L536103,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Come on, Pavel..."
99357,L536102,u2951,m194,BONES,"Wake up, man, wake up!"
99358,L536090,u2951,m194,BONES,Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
99359,L536089,u2958,m194,KIRK,"An experimental device, doctor."
99360,L536082,u2951,m194,BONES,Cramps.
99361,L536081,u2958,m194,KIRK,What did you say she was getting?
99362,L536057,u2958,m194,KIRK,"What do you think, Spock?"
99363,L536056,u2951,m194,BONES,"Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine."
99364,L535649,u2958,m194,KIRK,Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
99365,L535648,u2951,m194,BONES,"Oh, joy."
99366,L535643,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park."
99367,L535642,u2951,m194,BONES,It doesn't look all that different.
99368,L535572,u2958,m194,KIRK,If you have a better idea - now's the time.
99369,L535571,u2951,m194,BONES,That's crazy!
99370,L535570,u2958,m194,KIRK,-- That's the general idea.
99371,L535569,u2951,m194,BONES,"I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!"
99372,L535568,u2958,m194,KIRK,Would you prefer to do nothing?
99373,L535567,u2951,m194,BONES,"Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry.."
99374,L535566,u2958,m194,KIRK,We've done it before.
99375,L535565,u2951,m194,BONES,You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
99376,L535551,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit."
99377,L535550,u2951,m194,BONES,Now wait just a damn minute.
99378,L535530,u2951,m194,BONES,No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
99379,L535529,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Bones, stay here."
99380,L535518,u2951,m194,BONES,"Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!"
99381,L535517,u2958,m194,KIRK,Bones --
99382,L535478,u2958,m194,KIRK,Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
99383,L535477,u2951,m194,BONES,Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
99384,L535476,u2958,m194,KIRK,It'll come back to him.
99385,L535475,u2951,m194,BONES,"I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters."
99386,L535474,u2958,m194,KIRK,What do you mean?
99387,L535473,u2951,m194,BONES,You sure this is such a bright idea?
99388,L535417,u2951,m194,BONES,I just wish we could cloak the stench.
99389,L535416,u2958,m194,KIRK,We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
99390,L535415,u2951,m194,BONES,You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
99391,L536211,u2951,m194,BONES,It is.
99392,L536210,u2967,m194,SPOCK,You're saying... It is a compliment.
99393,L536209,u2951,m194,BONES,"No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your ""guesses"" than most other peoples facts."
99394,L536208,u2967,m194,SPOCK,... I don't think he understands...
99395,L536163,u2951,m194,BONES,Well nobody's perfect...
99396,L536162,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"""Guessing"" is not in my nature..."
99397,L536161,u2951,m194,BONES,"Guess, Spock. Your best guess."
99398,L536160,u2967,m194,SPOCK,... Best shot...?
99399,L536159,u2951,m194,BONES,"Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot."
99400,L536158,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Acceleration is no longer a constant.
99401,L536157,u2951,m194,BONES,Naturally.  So what is your problem?
99402,L536156,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve."
99403,L536155,u2951,m194,BONES,"You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem."
99404,L535593,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Hamlet, Act I scene 4."
99405,L535592,u2951,m194,BONES,"Angels and ministers of grace, defend us."
99406,L535549,u2951,m194,BONES,Then how.?
99407,L535548,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"That is what I said, Doctor."
99408,L535547,u2951,m194,BONES,You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
99409,L535538,u2951,m194,BONES,... My God...
99410,L535537,u2967,m194,SPOCK,10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
99411,L535535,u2951,m194,BONES,That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
99412,L535534,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Specifically, Humpback Whales."
99413,L535516,u2951,m194,BONES,I liked him better before he died.
99414,L535515,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man."
99415,L535514,u2951,m194,BONES,"Really? You think this is its way of saying ""Hi there"" to the people of the Earth?"
99416,L535513,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
99417,L535507,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress."
99418,L535506,u2951,m194,BONES,You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
99419,L535505,u2967,m194,SPOCK,A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
99420,L535504,u2951,m194,BONES,You're joking...!
99421,L535503,u2967,m194,SPOCK,It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
99422,L535502,u2951,m194,BONES,"Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?"
99423,L535501,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
99424,L535500,u2951,m194,BONES,"Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?"
99425,L535499,u2967,m194,SPOCK,... My shoes...
99426,L535498,u2951,m194,BONES,"Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes."
99427,L535497,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
99428,L535496,u2951,m194,BONES,Hi... Busy?
99429,L536096,u2951,m194,BONES,"My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!"
99430,L536095,u2955,m194,DOCTOR,A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
99431,L536094,u2951,m194,BONES,Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
99432,L536093,u2955,m194,DOCTOR,Fundoscopic examination --
99433,L536092,u2951,m194,BONES,"How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?"
99434,L536091,u2955,m194,DOCTOR,"What's your degree in, dentistry?"
99435,L536088,u2951,m194,BONES,Reading the patient's vital signs.
99436,L536087,u2955,m194,DOCTOR,What the hell do you think you're doing?
99437,L536086,u2955,m194,DOCTOR,I was not informed about observers.
99438,L536085,u2951,m194,BONES,We're just -- observing.
99439,L536084,u2955,m194,DOCTOR,Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
99440,L535383,u2952,m194,CAPTAIN,We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
99441,L535382,u2965,m194,SCIENCE OFFICER,Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
99442,L535381,u2952,m194,CAPTAIN,Damage report!
99443,L535375,u2965,m194,SCIENCE OFFICER,Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
99444,L535374,u2952,m194,CAPTAIN,Can you isolate the wave?
99445,L535373,u2965,m194,SCIENCE OFFICER,"Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!"
99446,L535372,u2952,m194,CAPTAIN,What's causing that!?
99447,L535944,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
99448,L535943,u2970,m194,UHURA,How long?
99449,L535784,u2970,m194,UHURA,"It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it."
99450,L535783,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,... It gives me a great sense of history.
99451,L535782,u2970,m194,UHURA,I have the coordinates of the reactor...
99452,L535781,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please..."
99453,L535695,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"Yes, under ""U.S. Government."" Now we need directions."
99454,L535694,u2970,m194,UHURA,Find it?
99455,L536004,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"I'm wery sorry, but --"
99456,L536003,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,Go ahead. Stun me.
99457,L536002,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you."
99458,L536001,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
99459,L535995,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,I am? May I go now?
99460,L535994,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,You play games with me and you're through
99461,L535993,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,I do not know your name.
99462,L535992,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,"No, <u>my</u> name."
99463,L535991,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,My name?
99464,L535990,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,Name?
99465,L535989,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,The top of what?
99466,L535988,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,All right. Let's take it from the top.
99467,L535987,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b."
99468,L535986,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
99469,L535985,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,Like what?
99470,L535984,u2956,m194,FBI AGENT,"All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?"
99471,L536246,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!"
99472,L536245,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding."
99473,L536140,u2958,m194,KIRK,Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
99474,L536139,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
99475,L535789,u2958,m194,KIRK,Understood. What is your plan?
99476,L535788,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"And Admiral, it's the Enterprise."
99477,L535787,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Ah, well done, team 2."
99478,L535647,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank."
99479,L535646,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"Yes, sir."
99480,L535603,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"Sir, heat shields at maximum!"
99481,L535602,u2958,m194,KIRK,"No choice now, Scotty!"
99482,L535597,u2958,m194,KIRK,"May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!"
99483,L535596,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"Shields, aye."
99484,L535595,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Shields, Mr. Chekov."
99485,L535494,u2958,m194,KIRK,"That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?"
99486,L535493,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations."
99487,L535460,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty."
99488,L535459,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral."
99489,L535458,u2958,m194,KIRK,"I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage."
99490,L535457,u2953,m194,CHEKOV,"Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight."
99491,L535445,u2960,m194,MORROW,We are launching everything we have.
99492,L535444,u2954,m194,COUNCIL PRESIDENT,Can you protect us?
99493,L535443,u2960,m194,MORROW,We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
99494,L535442,u2954,m194,COUNCIL PRESIDENT,"""Neutralized?"" How?"
99495,L535441,u2960,m194,MORROW,"Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized."
99496,L535440,u2954,m194,COUNCIL PRESIDENT,"Status report, Admiral!"
99497,L535886,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Is there something wrong with the one I have?
99498,L535885,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,You sure you won't change your mind?
99499,L535822,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?"
99500,L535821,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
99501,L535807,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I was not.
99502,L535806,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,So you were at Berkeley.
99503,L535743,u2967,m194,SPOCK,The hell they did.
99504,L535742,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,I suppose they told you that...?
99505,L535741,u2967,m194,SPOCK,They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
99506,L535735,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
99507,L535734,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Attempting the hell to communicate.
99508,L535717,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy."
99509,L535716,u2967,m194,SPOCK,To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
99510,L536284,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
99511,L536283,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?"
99512,L536282,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Why does it have to be goodbye?
99513,L536281,u2958,m194,KIRK,You mean this is -- goodbye?
99514,L536280,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do."
99515,L536279,u2958,m194,KIRK,Hey! -- Where you going?!
99516,L536220,u2958,m194,KIRK,... You have a point...
99517,L536219,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
99518,L536218,u2958,m194,KIRK,He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
99519,L536217,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,... What does that mean?
99520,L536178,u2958,m194,KIRK,Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
99521,L536177,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Oh my God, we're too late!"
99522,L536135,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,You need me.
99523,L536134,u2958,m194,KIRK,You tricked me.
99524,L536127,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty."
99525,L536126,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
99526,L536125,u2958,m194,KIRK,"I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>."
99527,L536124,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
99528,L536123,u2958,m194,KIRK,You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
99529,L536122,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
99530,L536121,u2958,m194,KIRK,All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
99531,L536120,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you."
99532,L536119,u2958,m194,KIRK,Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
99533,L536117,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!"
99534,L536116,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"If we keep going up, they'll catch us!"
99535,L536045,u2958,m194,KIRK,A spaceship with a missing man.
99536,L536044,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?"
99537,L536041,u2958,m194,KIRK,... Damn!
99538,L536040,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
99539,L536039,u2958,m194,KIRK,... Gone?!
99540,L536038,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Kirk. They're gone.
99541,L536037,u2958,m194,KIRK,We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
99542,L536036,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,But Kirk...
99543,L536035,u2958,m194,KIRK,It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
99544,L536034,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
99545,L536033,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Steady, now. We need your help."
99546,L536032,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in..."
99547,L536031,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,It's true... what you said...
99548,L535955,u2958,m194,KIRK,Right.
99549,L535954,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Here... In the park?
99550,L535953,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be."
99551,L535952,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,I bet you're a damn good poker player.
99552,L535951,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them."
99553,L535950,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,So. There we are.
99554,L535949,u2958,m194,KIRK,"It wouldn't be my first choice, no."
99555,L535948,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?"
99556,L535947,u2958,m194,KIRK,"You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?"
99557,L535946,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Well, ""Admiral,"" that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard."
99558,L535938,u2958,m194,KIRK,Noon tomorrow...?!
99559,L535937,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out."
99560,L535936,u2958,m194,KIRK,Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
99561,L535935,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
99562,L535934,u2958,m194,KIRK,You want the details?
99563,L535933,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?"
99564,L535932,u2958,m194,KIRK,"That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species."
99565,L535931,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,I'm all ears.
99566,L535930,u2958,m194,KIRK,All right. The truth?
99567,L535929,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later."
99568,L535928,u2958,m194,KIRK,"No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space."
99569,L535927,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
99570,L535926,u2958,m194,KIRK,Who do you think I am?
99571,L535925,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,... Who are you?
99572,L535924,u2958,m194,KIRK,Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
99573,L535923,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Wanna try it from the top?
99574,L535919,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?"
99575,L535918,u2958,m194,KIRK,What's what?
99576,L535917,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,What's that?
99577,L535916,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn."
99578,L535915,u2958,m194,KIRK,What do you mean now?
99579,L535914,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Sorry, the time would have to be right now."
99580,L535913,u2958,m194,KIRK,It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
99581,L535912,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
99582,L535911,u2958,m194,KIRK,Hm?
99583,L535910,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Where could you take them?
99584,L535909,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral."
99585,L535908,u2958,m194,KIRK,"If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?"
99586,L535907,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Thanks. Cheers.
99587,L535906,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
99588,L535905,u2958,m194,KIRK,"You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted."
99589,L535904,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them."
99590,L535903,u2958,m194,KIRK,Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
99591,L535902,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
99592,L535901,u2958,m194,KIRK,"How will that be done, exactly?"
99593,L535900,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,... You're very perceptive.
99594,L535899,u2958,m194,KIRK,You're upset about losing the whales.
99595,L535898,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Just lucky, I guess."
99596,L535897,u2958,m194,KIRK,So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
99597,L535894,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
99598,L535893,u2958,m194,KIRK,Implicitly.
99599,L535892,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Do you trust me?
99600,L535891,u2958,m194,KIRK,It's his way.
99601,L535890,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
99602,L535888,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
99603,L535887,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Just a little joke. See you later, old friend."
99604,L535831,u2958,m194,KIRK,Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
99605,L535830,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Or believe, I'll bet."
99606,L535829,u2958,m194,KIRK,"In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine."
99607,L535828,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Then --
99608,L535827,u2958,m194,KIRK,"We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales."
99609,L535826,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
99610,L535824,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here."
99611,L535823,u2958,m194,KIRK,"No, ma'am. No dipshit."
99612,L535817,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
99613,L535816,u2958,m194,KIRK,"What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances."
99614,L535815,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,They're gonna hafta take their chances.
99615,L535814,u2958,m194,KIRK,What's going to happen when you release the whales?
99616,L535813,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Go ahead.
99617,L535812,u2958,m194,KIRK,Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
99618,L535811,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type."
99619,L535810,u2958,m194,KIRK,Iowa.
99620,L535809,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
99621,L535808,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Memory problems, too."
99622,L535805,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it."
99623,L535804,u2958,m194,KIRK,Thanks.
99624,L535803,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,You've already been that. C'mon.
99625,L535802,u2958,m194,KIRK,We don't want to be any trouble.
99626,L535801,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales."
99627,L535800,u2958,m194,KIRK,He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
99628,L535799,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,I buy that. What about him?
99629,L535798,u2958,m194,KIRK,There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
99630,L535797,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?"
99631,L535796,u2958,m194,KIRK,Back to San Francisco.
99632,L535740,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales..."
99633,L535739,u2958,m194,KIRK,I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
99634,L535738,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops."
99635,L535726,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
99636,L535725,u2958,m194,KIRK,How soon?
99637,L535724,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!"
99638,L535723,u2958,m194,KIRK,Why's that?
99639,L535722,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
99640,L535720,u2958,m194,KIRK,"It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky..."
99641,L535719,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie."
99642,L535714,u2957,m194,GILLIAN,"To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century."
99643,L535713,u2958,m194,KIRK,You mean man...
99644,L536257,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"I will, Admiral."
99645,L536256,u2958,m194,KIRK,"You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands."
99646,L536244,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional."
99647,L536243,u2958,m194,KIRK,Spock: Condition report!
99648,L536234,u2958,m194,KIRK,Then... Where the hell are we?
99649,L536233,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"They did, Admiral."
99650,L536232,u2958,m194,KIRK,Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
99651,L536227,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory."
99652,L536226,u2958,m194,KIRK,Can we make breakaway speed!?
99653,L536207,u2958,m194,KIRK,"<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary."
99654,L536206,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>."
99655,L536205,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?"
99656,L536130,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Admiral, you must wait one damn minute."
99657,L536129,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?"
99658,L536061,u2958,m194,KIRK,Right.  Will you help us?
99659,L536060,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do."
99660,L536059,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?"
99661,L536058,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov."
99662,L536047,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Thank you, Spock."
99663,L536046,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Admiral. Full power is restored.
99664,L535962,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!"
99665,L535961,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail."
99666,L535960,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!"
99667,L535959,u2967,m194,SPOCK,No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
99668,L535958,u2958,m194,KIRK,That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
99669,L535957,u2967,m194,SPOCK,The tank will be finished by morning...
99670,L535956,u2958,m194,KIRK,Status?
99671,L535819,u2958,m194,KIRK,"He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever."
99672,L535818,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I meant --
99673,L535793,u2967,m194,SPOCK,How will playing cards help?
99674,L535792,u2958,m194,KIRK,"It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving."
99675,L535760,u2958,m194,KIRK,... I see.
99676,L535759,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
99677,L535758,u2958,m194,KIRK,They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
99678,L535757,u2967,m194,SPOCK,They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
99679,L535756,u2958,m194,KIRK,What else did you learn from your mind meld?
99680,L535755,u2967,m194,SPOCK,The hell I can't
99681,L535754,u2958,m194,KIRK,You've done it before. Can't you remember?
99682,L535753,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Exaggerate.
99683,L535752,u2958,m194,KIRK,You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
99684,L535751,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I cannot tell a lie.
99685,L535750,u2958,m194,KIRK,And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
99686,L535749,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I see.
99687,L535748,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it."
99688,L535747,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Why not?
99689,L535746,u2958,m194,KIRK,About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
99690,L535745,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Yes?
99691,L535744,u2958,m194,KIRK,Spock...
99692,L535737,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction."
99693,L535736,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Come on, fellah -- speak up!"
99694,L535708,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Ah... The giants.
99695,L535707,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins...."
99696,L535706,u2967,m194,SPOCK,For example?
99697,L535705,u2958,m194,KIRK,You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
99698,L535704,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: ""Double dumb ass on you"" -- and so forth..."
99699,L535703,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?"
99700,L535702,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Admiral, may I ask you a question?"
99701,L535701,u2958,m194,KIRK,Yes.
99702,L535700,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"As you observed, a primitive Culture."
99703,L535687,u2958,m194,KIRK,... Simple logic.
99704,L535686,u2967,m194,SPOCK,How do you know this...?
99705,L535685,u2958,m194,KIRK,I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
99706,L535683,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
99707,L535682,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?"
99708,L535678,u2958,m194,KIRK,"And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?"
99709,L535677,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
99710,L535641,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
99711,L535640,u2958,m194,KIRK,Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
99712,L535639,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically."
99713,L535638,u2958,m194,KIRK,But you said toxic.
99714,L535637,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some."
99715,L535636,u2958,m194,KIRK,Explain.
99716,L535635,u2967,m194,SPOCK,There is a 20th Century possibility.
99717,L535621,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!"
99718,L535620,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time."
99719,L535619,u2958,m194,KIRK,Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
99720,L535616,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Well done, Mr. Spock."
99721,L535615,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century."
99722,L535614,u2958,m194,KIRK,Earth... But when?... Spock?
99723,L535591,u2967,m194,SPOCK,I have.
99724,L535590,u2958,m194,KIRK,You've programmed that from memory...?
99725,L535589,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin."
99726,L535588,u2958,m194,KIRK,What are the variables...?
99727,L535587,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
99728,L535586,u2958,m194,KIRK,Surely you can be more specific...
99729,L535585,u2967,m194,SPOCK,The late 20th Century.
99730,L535584,u2958,m194,KIRK,What is our target in time?
99731,L535583,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Ready to engage computer, Admiral."
99732,L535575,u2958,m194,KIRK,Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
99733,L535574,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"In progress, Admiral."
99734,L535573,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Mr. Spock, your computations?"
99735,L535546,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales."
99736,L535545,u2958,m194,KIRK,But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
99737,L535544,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily."
99738,L535543,u2958,m194,KIRK,That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
99739,L535542,u2967,m194,SPOCK,The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
99740,L535541,u2958,m194,KIRK,Is there any other planet where this species exists?
99741,L535540,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish."
99742,L535539,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?"
99743,L535533,u2958,m194,KIRK,Whales?
99744,L535532,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales."
99745,L535531,u2958,m194,KIRK,Spock...?
99746,L535528,u2967,m194,SPOCK,To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
99747,L535527,u2958,m194,KIRK,Where are you going?!
99748,L535521,u2958,m194,KIRK,Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
99749,L535520,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans"
99750,L535519,u2958,m194,KIRK,Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
99751,L535472,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please."
99752,L535471,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform."
99753,L535470,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?"
99754,L535469,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Thank you, Admiral."
99755,L535468,u2958,m194,KIRK,Permission granted.
99756,L535467,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Permission to come aboard.
99757,L536303,u2968,m194,SULU,"Aye, sir!"
99758,L536302,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu."
99759,L536254,u2958,m194,KIRK,Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
99760,L536253,u2968,m194,SULU,Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
99761,L536248,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Picture, Uhura!"
99762,L536247,u2968,m194,SULU,"I have no control, sir!"
99763,L536184,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu..."
99764,L536183,u2968,m194,SULU,"10 seconds, sir!"
99765,L536148,u2968,m194,SULU,"Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes."
99766,L536147,u2958,m194,KIRK,Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
99767,L536146,u2968,m194,SULU,"10,000 M.S.L., Admiral."
99768,L536144,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!"
99769,L536143,u2968,m194,SULU,"Three-one-zero, aye!"
99770,L536142,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero."
99771,L536141,u2968,m194,SULU,"Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady."
99772,L536137,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Go, Mr. Sulu."
99773,L536136,u2968,m194,SULU,Ready sir.
99774,L535645,u2958,m194,KIRK,We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
99775,L535644,u2968,m194,SULU,"Aye, sir. Descending."
99776,L535613,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Picture, please."
99777,L535612,u2968,m194,SULU,Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
99778,L535611,u2958,m194,KIRK,What is our condition?
99779,L535610,u2968,m194,SULU,... Aye sir...?
99780,L535609,u2958,m194,KIRK,Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
99781,L535607,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!"
99782,L535606,u2968,m194,SULU,"Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold..."
99783,L535605,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!"
99784,L535604,u2968,m194,SULU,Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
99785,L535599,u2958,m194,KIRK,Steady as she goes...
99786,L535598,u2968,m194,SULU,Warp two... three...
99787,L535492,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?"
99788,L535491,u2968,m194,SULU,Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
99789,L535456,u2958,m194,KIRK,Weapons systems?

99792,L536249,u2970,m194,UHURA,"I can't, sir -- Nothing!"
99793,L536199,u2958,m194,KIRK,Mr. Scott -- how soon?
99794,L536198,u2970,m194,UHURA,"Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010."
99795,L536176,u2970,m194,UHURA,Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
99796,L536175,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Estimate range, ship to whales!"
99797,L536172,u2958,m194,KIRK,On screen.
99798,L536171,u2970,m194,UHURA,"Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees."
99799,L536168,u2958,m194,KIRK,Put them on screen!
99800,L536167,u2970,m194,UHURA,"Bearing 327, range 600 nautical."
99801,L536166,u2958,m194,KIRK,Bearing!
99802,L536053,u2970,m194,UHURA,Mercy Hospital.
99803,L536052,u2958,m194,KIRK,Uhura!... Where!
99804,L536051,u2970,m194,UHURA,"I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now."
99805,L536012,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him..."
99806,L536011,u2970,m194,UHURA,Nothing... I should never have left him...
99807,L536010,u2958,m194,KIRK,Any luck...?
99808,L535660,u2958,m194,KIRK,Everyone remember where we parked.
99809,L535659,u2970,m194,UHURA,283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
99810,L535658,u2958,m194,KIRK,We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
99811,L535651,u2958,m194,KIRK,Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
99812,L535650,u2970,m194,UHURA,"I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir."
99813,L535625,u2958,m194,KIRK,From a city? That doesn't make sense....
99814,L535624,u2970,m194,UHURA,"Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco."
99815,L535618,u2958,m194,KIRK,On speakers.
99816,L535617,u2970,m194,UHURA,"Admiral, I am receiving whale songs."
99817,L535525,u2970,m194,UHURA,"Yes, sir."
99818,L535524,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?"
99819,L535510,u2958,m194,KIRK,On screen!

99821,L535508,u2958,m194,KIRK,What is it?
99822,L535454,u2958,m194,KIRK,Mr. Sulu?
99823,L535453,u2970,m194,UHURA,Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
99824,L535452,u2958,m194,KIRK,Systems report.  Communications?
99825,L536297,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship."
99826,L536296,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
99827,L536263,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Admiral, you'll be trapped!"
99828,L536262,u2958,m194,KIRK,Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
99829,L536261,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
99830,L536260,u2958,m194,KIRK,The explosive override -- ?
99831,L536259,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,No power to the bay doors.

99833,L536222,u2958,m194,KIRK,On my way...!
99834,L536221,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off..."
99835,L536214,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium."
99836,L536213,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future..."
99837,L536203,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Mr. Sulu, if you please."
99838,L536202,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Full power, sir."

99840,L536200,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work..."
99841,L536197,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb."
99842,L536196,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,I'll have to re-energize.
99843,L536195,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?"
99844,L536194,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Admiral! There be whales here!
99845,L536193,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1."
99846,L536192,u2958,m194,KIRK,"How long, Scotty?"
99847,L536191,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve..."
99848,L536150,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
99849,L536149,u2958,m194,KIRK,Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
99850,L536132,u2958,m194,KIRK,Mr. Sulu?
99851,L536131,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
99852,L536016,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he."
99853,L536015,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!"
99854,L536014,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow."
99855,L535922,u2958,m194,KIRK,Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
99856,L535921,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now."
99857,L535920,u2958,m194,KIRK,What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
99858,L535634,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century."
99859,L535633,u2958,m194,KIRK,"I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?"
99860,L535632,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home."
99861,L535631,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott."
99862,L535630,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
99863,L535563,u2958,m194,KIRK,"It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott."
99864,L535562,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Two?
99865,L535561,u2958,m194,KIRK,"You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them."
99866,L535560,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
99867,L535559,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece."
99868,L535558,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Humpbacked - people.?
99869,L535557,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks."
99870,L535555,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?"
99871,L535554,u2958,m194,KIRK,That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
99872,L535553,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"About 60 feet, Admiral."
99873,L535552,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Scotty, how long is this bay?"
99874,L535462,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure."
99875,L535461,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach."
99876,L535414,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard."
99877,L535413,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?"
99878,L535464,u2963,m194,SAAVIK,"Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know."
99879,L535463,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye."
99880,L535423,u2958,m194,KIRK,You will be in good hands here.
99881,L535422,u2963,m194,SAAVIK,"I am well, Admiral."
99882,L535421,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?"
99883,L535420,u2963,m194,SAAVIK,"And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify."
99884,L535419,u2958,m194,KIRK,"Thank you, Lt. Saavik."
99885,L535418,u2963,m194,SAAVIK,"Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave."
99886,L535398,u2964,m194,SAREK,Do you have the right to murder?
99887,L535397,u2959,m194,KLINGON AMBASSADOR,We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
99888,L535396,u2964,m194,SAREK,Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
99889,L535395,u2959,m194,KLINGON AMBASSADOR,Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
99890,L535394,u2964,m194,SAREK,Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
99891,L535393,u2964,m194,SAREK,"Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President."
99892,L535392,u2959,m194,KLINGON AMBASSADOR,"Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called ""The Genesis Planet..."" A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!"
99893,L535876,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
99894,L535875,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"That's the ticket, laddie."
99895,L535874,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,Transparent aluminum?
99896,L535873,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,The keyboard... How quaint.
99897,L535872,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,Just use the keyboard...
99898,L535871,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Hello? Computer...?
99899,L535867,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,... Are you joking?
99900,L535866,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?"
99901,L535865,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
99902,L535864,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?"
99903,L535863,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,Sill? What else would I be working with?
99904,L535862,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,I notice you're still working with polymers.
99905,L535861,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,... Yes?
99906,L535860,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>."
99907,L535849,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,Of course.
99908,L535848,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"I will. Can my assistant come, too?"
99909,L535847,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,"If you'll follow me, Professor --"
99910,L535846,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,"Well, that's different."
99911,L535845,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,With pleasure.
99912,L535842,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,I demand to see the owners! I demand --
99913,L535841,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,"Professor Scott, if you'll --"
99914,L535838,u2961,m194,NICHOLS,Millions?
99915,L535837,u2966,m194,SCOTTY,Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
99916,L535856,u2968,m194,SULU,"Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?"
99917,L535855,u2962,m194,PILOT,"All right, then this is old stuff to you."
99918,L535854,u2968,m194,SULU,"Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days."
99919,L535853,u2962,m194,PILOT,Right on. You fly?
99920,L535852,u2968,m194,SULU,"Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?"
99921,L535851,u2962,m194,PILOT,Hi.
99922,L536293,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Tell her I feel fine...
99923,L536292,u2964,m194,SAREK,"Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?"
99924,L536291,u2967,m194,SPOCK,They are my friends.
99925,L536290,u2964,m194,SAREK,"As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character."
99926,L536289,u2967,m194,SPOCK,"Most kind, Father."
99927,L536288,u2964,m194,SAREK,It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
99928,L536287,u2967,m194,SPOCK,It is kind of you to make this effort.
99929,L536286,u2964,m194,SAREK,I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
99930,L536285,u2967,m194,SPOCK,Father...?
99931,L535672,u2969,m194,THE BOY,"Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir."
99932,L535671,u2968,m194,SULU,"Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life."
99933,L535670,u2969,m194,THE BOY,Sulu Hikaru.
99934,L535669,u2968,m194,SULU,Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
99935,L535668,u2969,m194,THE BOY,"Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny."
99936,L535667,u2968,m194,SULU,"Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else."
99937,L535666,u2969,m194,THE BOY,Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
99938,L537130,u2980,m195,PICARD,"The ""mighty"" Federation could learn a few things from this village..."
99939,L537129,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
99940,L537117,u2971,m195,ANIJ,I'll be here.
99941,L537116,u2980,m195,PICARD,But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
99942,L537112,u2980,m195,PICARD,I thought it might begin the healing process.
99943,L537111,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Mother and son. You arranged this...?
99944,L537007,u2980,m195,PICARD,"You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide."
99945,L537006,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you."
99946,L536893,u2980,m195,PICARD,This way!
99947,L536892,u2971,m195,ANIJ,There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
99948,L536867,u2980,m195,PICARD,I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
99949,L536866,u2971,m195,ANIJ,What's the rush?
99950,L536865,u2980,m195,PICARD,"How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you ""just haven't gotten around to it yet""..."
99951,L536863,u2980,m195,PICARD,By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
99952,L536862,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
99953,L536859,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away..."
99954,L536858,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Jak'tahla?
99955,L536799,u2980,m195,PICARD,We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...
99956,L536798,u2971,m195,ANIJ,There are caves in those mountains.
99957,L536797,u2980,m195,PICARD,"When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible..."
99958,L536730,u2971,m195,ANIJ,For someone so young.
99959,L536729,u2980,m195,PICARD,... an offlander?
99960,L536728,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for..."
99961,L536727,u2971,m195,ANIJ,I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
99962,L536726,u2980,m195,PICARD,There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
99963,L536725,u2971,m195,ANIJ,It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
99964,L536724,u2980,m195,PICARD,I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
99965,L536723,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
99966,L536722,u2980,m195,PICARD,Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
99967,L536721,u2971,m195,ANIJ,When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
99968,L536720,u2980,m195,PICARD,A perfect moment?
99969,L536719,u2971,m195,ANIJ,You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
99970,L536718,u2980,m195,PICARD,Will it?
99971,L536717,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change."
99972,L536716,u2980,m195,PICARD,An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
99973,L536715,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans..."
99974,L536714,u2980,m195,PICARD,The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
99975,L536713,u2980,m195,PICARD,"You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't."
99976,L536712,u2971,m195,ANIJ,... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
99977,L536711,u2980,m195,PICARD,"In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me..."
99978,L536710,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard."
99979,L536709,u2980,m195,PICARD,There are days.
99980,L536708,u2971,m195,ANIJ,But not you.
99981,L536707,u2980,m195,PICARD,Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
99982,L536706,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life..."
99983,L536705,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them."
99984,L536696,u2980,m195,PICARD,We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
99985,L536695,u2971,m195,ANIJ,There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
99986,L536663,u2971,m195,ANIJ,I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
99987,L536662,u2980,m195,PICARD,Don't panic...
99988,L536657,u2980,m195,PICARD,"To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it."
99989,L536656,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Deceive us?
99990,L536653,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship..."
99991,L536652,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?"
99992,L536609,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Then you must spend your life answering questions.
99993,L536608,u2980,m195,PICARD,I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
99994,L536607,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Why?
99995,L536606,u2980,m195,PICARD,I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
99996,L536549,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?"
99997,L536548,u2980,m195,PICARD,You have warp capability?
99998,L536543,u2980,m195,PICARD,"If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill..."
99999,L536542,u2971,m195,ANIJ,Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
100000,L536541,u2980,m195,PICARD,"My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive."
100001,L536537,u2971,m195,ANIJ,"It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will."
100002,L536536,u2980,m195,PICARD,We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
100003,L537134,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Bye.
100004,L537133,u2974,m195,DATA,I have to go home now.
100005,L536968,u2974,m195,DATA,It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
100006,L536967,u2972,m195,ARTIM,No... I want to stay with you...
100007,L536966,u2974,m195,DATA,Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
100008,L536965,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Anij!
100009,L536855,u2972,m195,ARTIM,"If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play..."
100010,L536854,u2974,m195,DATA,No one's ever asked me that before.
100011,L536853,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Why not...?
100012,L536852,u2974,m195,DATA,Androids... don't have...fun.
100013,L536851,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
100014,L536850,u2974,m195,DATA,But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
100015,L536849,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
100016,L536848,u2974,m195,DATA,For what purpose?
100017,L536847,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Chase me!
100018,L536844,u2972,m195,ARTIM,"No, I mean..."
100019,L536843,u2974,m195,DATA,I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
100020,L536842,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Do machines ever play?
100021,L536841,u2974,m195,DATA,I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
100022,L536840,u2972,m195,ARTIM,But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
100023,L536839,u2974,m195,DATA,My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
100024,L536838,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Sometimes I do.
100025,L536837,u2974,m195,DATA,But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
100026,L536836,u2972,m195,ARTIM,"For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's."
100027,L536835,u2974,m195,DATA,Really.
100028,L536834,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Really?
100029,L536833,u2974,m195,DATA,Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
100030,L536832,u2972,m195,ARTIM,I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
100031,L536831,u2974,m195,DATA,My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
100032,L536830,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Don't you ever get tired?
100033,L536829,u2974,m195,DATA,"Perhaps, that is true."
100034,L536828,u2972,m195,ARTIM,I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
100035,L536827,u2974,m195,DATA,I aspire to be more than I am.
100036,L536826,u2972,m195,ARTIM,"Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?"
100037,L536825,u2972,m195,ARTIM,I don't.
100038,L536824,u2974,m195,DATA,I understand.
100039,L536823,u2972,m195,ARTIM,My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
100040,L536612,u2974,m195,DATA,I am better.
100041,L536611,u2972,m195,ARTIM,You're what?
100042,L536610,u2974,m195,DATA,There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
100043,L536701,u2980,m195,PICARD,"If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now."
100044,L536700,u2972,m195,ARTIM,The artificial lifeform was right?
100045,L536699,u2980,m195,PICARD,"To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you."
100046,L536639,u2980,m195,PICARD,No.
100047,L536638,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Won't he rust?
100048,L536637,u2980,m195,PICARD,Data doesn't breathe.
100049,L536636,u2972,m195,ARTIM,Can he breathe under water?
100050,L536684,u2981,m195,PICARD'S COM VOICE,"Very good, Doctor. Picard out."
100051,L536683,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,"Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky."
100052,L536682,u2981,m195,PICARD'S COM VOICE,Are they in any danger?
100053,L536681,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
100054,L536680,u2981,m195,PICARD'S COM VOICE,And our people?
100055,L536679,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,"Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters."
100056,L536988,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,Safer than leaving her here.
100057,L536987,u2980,m195,PICARD,Is it safe to move her?
100058,L536986,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,She's stabilizing.
100059,L536956,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,Yes. But look at this medscan...
100060,L536955,u2980,m195,PICARD,Will he live?
100061,L536535,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
100062,L536534,u2980,m195,PICARD,Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
100063,L536349,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
100064,L536348,u2980,m195,PICARD,Very funny...
100065,L536328,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
100066,L536327,u2980,m195,PICARD,'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
100067,L536326,u2973,m195,CRUSHER,You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
100068,L536934,u2974,m195,DATA,"I believe it is safe, sir."
100069,L536933,u2980,m195,PICARD,Will the structure hold if we blast through?
100070,L536932,u2974,m195,DATA,"I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain..."
100071,L536927,u2974,m195,DATA,"Another forty-three people reported taken, sir..."
100072,L536926,u2980,m195,PICARD,How many?
100073,L536801,u2980,m195,PICARD,Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
100074,L536800,u2974,m195,DATA,"Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village..."
100075,L536659,u2980,m195,PICARD,I don't know.
100076,L536658,u2974,m195,DATA,Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
100077,L536655,u2980,m195,PICARD,What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
100078,L536654,u2974,m195,DATA,... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
100079,L536651,u2980,m195,PICARD,What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
100080,L536650,u2974,m195,DATA,"Incomplete, I might add."
100081,L536645,u2980,m195,PICARD,'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
100082,L536644,u2974,m195,DATA,"It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain."
100083,L536643,u2980,m195,PICARD,"A ship,"
100084,L536634,u2980,m195,PICARD,How about a passive radiation scan?
100085,L536633,u2974,m195,DATA,Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
100086,L536617,u2974,m195,DATA,And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
100087,L536616,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks..."
100088,L536615,u2974,m195,DATA,... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
100089,L536614,u2980,m195,PICARD,It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
100090,L536613,u2974,m195,DATA,I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
100091,L536601,u2974,m195,DATA,"I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy..."
100092,L536600,u2980,m195,PICARD,From the mission...
100093,L536599,u2974,m195,DATA,'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
100094,L536598,u2980,m195,PICARD,"What's the last thing you remember, Data..."
100095,L536597,u2974,m195,DATA,Yes... that looks like them.
100096,L536594,u2980,m195,PICARD,You're aboard the Enterprise.
100097,L536593,u2974,m195,DATA,"Captain, Geordi...?"
100098,L536592,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Hello, Data..."
100099,L537013,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until..."
100100,L537012,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,I do not take orders from you.
100101,L537011,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,It is over.
100102,L537010,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,It is not over.
100103,L537009,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
100104,L536999,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,"In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying."
100105,L536998,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,You're not going to launch anything until...
100106,L536820,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
100107,L536819,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,I'll order Riker to turn around.
100108,L536816,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,"Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?"
100109,L536815,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation..."
100110,L536814,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
100111,L536813,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
100112,L536467,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
100113,L536466,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
100114,L536464,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet..."
100115,L536463,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,"Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed."
100116,L536392,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
100117,L536391,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,"Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer..."
100118,L536390,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,Another time.
100119,L536389,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,"Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face..."
100120,L536387,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
100121,L536386,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
100122,L536385,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
100123,L536996,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,There's nothing further to be gained from this...
100124,L536995,u2980,m195,PICARD,I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
100125,L536992,u2980,m195,PICARD,"If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it."
100126,L536991,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed."
100127,L536764,u2980,m195,PICARD,How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
100128,L536763,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc."
100129,L536762,u2980,m195,PICARD,We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
100130,L536761,u2980,m195,PICARD,The Ba'ku.
100131,L536760,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?"
100132,L536759,u2980,m195,PICARD,Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
100133,L536758,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
100134,L536757,u2980,m195,PICARD,Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
100135,L536756,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations."
100136,L536755,u2980,m195,PICARD,There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
100137,L536754,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?"
100138,L536753,u2980,m195,PICARD,Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
100139,L536752,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that..."
100140,L536751,u2980,m195,PICARD,Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
100141,L536750,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
100142,L536749,u2980,m195,PICARD,A planet in Federation space...
100143,L536748,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
100144,L536747,u2980,m195,PICARD,Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
100145,L536746,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
100146,L536745,u2980,m195,PICARD,How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
100147,L536744,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
100148,L536743,u2980,m195,PICARD,"... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council..."
100149,L536742,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
100150,L536741,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Your ""Briar Patch"" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected."
100151,L536740,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested."
100152,L536557,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
100153,L536556,u2980,m195,PICARD,You're not finished here?
100154,L536555,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
100155,L536554,u2980,m195,PICARD,In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
100156,L536553,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?"
100157,L536552,u2980,m195,PICARD,"... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal..."
100158,L536471,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,Good luck. Dougherty out.
100159,L536470,u2980,m195,PICARD,Understood.
100160,L536469,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail."
100161,L536462,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely..."
100162,L536461,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
100163,L536460,u2980,m195,PICARD,"This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral..."
100164,L536459,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,"Captain, I wasn't expecting you."
100165,L536376,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
100166,L536375,u2980,m195,PICARD,What kind of concerns?
100167,L536374,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
100168,L536373,u2980,m195,PICARD,"The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral..."
100169,L536372,u2975,m195,DOUGHERTY,... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
100170,L536371,u2980,m195,PICARD,You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
100171,L537095,u2980,m195,PICARD,Scan for lifesigns.
100172,L537094,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
100173,L537039,u2980,m195,PICARD,What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
100174,L537038,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,"It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link..."
100175,L537037,u2980,m195,PICARD,If we could lure him away from the bridge...
100176,L537036,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
100177,L537035,u2980,m195,PICARD,Do you know how to disable the injector?
100178,L537034,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
100179,L537032,u2980,m195,PICARD,"I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na."
100180,L537031,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
100181,L537030,u2980,m195,PICARD,A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
100182,L537023,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Thank-you for reminding me.
100183,L537022,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
100184,L537021,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
100185,L537020,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,"No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years..."
100186,L537019,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
100187,L537018,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Deploy the collector.
100188,L537017,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,May I talk to you alone?
100189,L537016,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
100190,L536818,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
100191,L536817,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
100192,L536812,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Recommendations?
100193,L536811,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
100194,L536791,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
100195,L536790,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,"Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board."
100196,L536789,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
100197,L536771,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
100198,L536770,u2976,m195,GALLATIN,"No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them..."
100199,L536769,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
100200,L536734,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise."
100201,L536733,u2980,m195,PICARD,... had regenerated.
100202,L536732,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves..."
100203,L536591,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,It's nothing. I'm just tired.
100204,L536590,u2980,m195,PICARD,Implants bothering you?
100205,L536589,u2980,m195,PICARD,And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
100206,L536588,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss."
100207,L536587,u2980,m195,PICARD,"So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong."
100208,L536586,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
100209,L536585,u2980,m195,PICARD,Fail-safe?
100210,L536584,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated..."
100211,L536583,u2980,m195,PICARD,Why would they fire at him without provocation?
100212,L536582,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,I don't believe it happened that way.
100213,L536581,u2980,m195,PICARD,The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
100214,L536580,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction."
100215,L536579,u2980,m195,PICARD,Do you know how they were damaged?
100216,L536578,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
100217,L536454,u2980,m195,PICARD,"When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment..."
100218,L536453,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
100219,L536414,u2980,m195,PICARD,Do you have everything you need from command?
100220,L536413,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain."
100221,L536383,u2980,m195,PICARD,Are they...?
100222,L536382,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"They... are in opposite directions, sir..."
100223,L536381,u2980,m195,PICARD,I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
100224,L536916,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
100225,L536915,u2982,m195,RIKER,That's your expert opinion?
100226,L536914,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"You got me, Commander."
100227,L536913,u2982,m195,RIKER,Will that stop the tear?
100228,L536881,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,I'll be in Engineering.
100229,L536880,u2982,m195,RIKER,"If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship."
100230,L536879,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander."
100231,L536878,u2982,m195,RIKER,Full impulse.
100232,L536877,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
100233,L536876,u2982,m195,RIKER,A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
100234,L536945,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come."
100235,L536944,u2983,m195,RIKER'S COM VOICE,If it works you mean.
100236,L536943,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
100237,L536939,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,The purpose being...?
100238,L536938,u2983,m195,RIKER'S COM VOICE,Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
100239,L536937,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,"Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance..."
100240,L536912,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,Eject the core.
100241,L536911,u2983,m195,RIKER'S COM VOICE,Options?
100242,L536910,u2977,m195,LA FORGE,We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
100243,L536942,u2982,m195,RIKER,"It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara."
100244,L536941,u2978,m195,NARA,"Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas..."
100245,L536940,u2982,m195,RIKER,The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
100246,L536918,u2982,m195,RIKER,Eject the core.
100247,L536917,u2978,m195,NARA,The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
100248,L536906,u2982,m195,RIKER,On screen.
100249,L536905,u2978,m195,NARA,"Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming..."
100250,L536875,u2982,m195,RIKER,Why not?
100251,L536874,u2978,m195,NARA,I don't think they believe us.
100252,L536950,u2982,m195,RIKER,Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
100253,L536949,u2979,m195,PERIM,They're powering their forward weapons array.
100254,L536925,u2982,m195,RIKER,We're through running from these bastards.
100255,L536924,u2979,m195,PERIM,"We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir."
100256,L536908,u2982,m195,RIKER,Remind me to lodge a protest...
100257,L536907,u2979,m195,PERIM,I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
100258,L536901,u2982,m195,RIKER,"Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops."
100259,L536900,u2979,m195,PERIM,"Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir..."
100260,L536899,u2982,m195,RIKER,What's inside that nebula cluster?
100261,L536870,u2979,m195,PERIM,Eighteen minutes...
100262,L536869,u2982,m195,RIKER,How long 'til they reach us?
100263,L536868,u2979,m195,PERIM,"Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course."
100264,L537092,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get..."
100265,L537091,u2982,m195,RIKER,The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
100266,L536786,u2982,m195,RIKER,Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
100267,L536785,u2980,m195,PICARD,"There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it..."
100268,L536777,u2980,m195,PICARD,Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
100269,L536776,u2982,m195,RIKER,You must be planning on doing some hunting.
100270,L536767,u2982,m195,RIKER,"Aye, sir."
100271,L536766,u2980,m195,PICARD,Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
100272,L536676,u2982,m195,RIKER,"You Klingons never do anything small, do you..."
100273,L536675,u2980,m195,PICARD,Deck five.
100274,L536674,u2980,m195,PICARD,We're not going anywhere.
100275,L536673,u2982,m195,RIKER,Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
100276,L536410,u2982,m195,RIKER,The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
100277,L536409,u2980,m195,PICARD,So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
100278,L536408,u2982,m195,RIKER,Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
100279,L536407,u2980,m195,PICARD,We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
100280,L536406,u2982,m195,RIKER,... and gorgonzolla cheese.
100281,L536402,u2982,m195,RIKER,Commander Riker...
100282,L536401,u2980,m195,PICARD,Who is it?
100283,L536342,u2982,m195,RIKER,Deck ten.
100284,L536341,u2980,m195,PICARD,'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
100285,L536340,u2980,m195,PICARD,... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
100286,L536339,u2982,m195,RIKER,The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
100287,L536338,u2980,m195,PICARD,We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
100288,L536337,u2982,m195,RIKER,They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
100289,L537110,u2985,m195,SOJEF,I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
100290,L537109,u2980,m195,PICARD,Ask them.
100291,L537108,u2985,m195,SOJEF,I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
100292,L536694,u2985,m195,SOJEF,"Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition."
100293,L536693,u2980,m195,PICARD,You've not aged a day since then?
100294,L536692,u2985,m195,SOJEF,We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
100295,L536533,u2985,m195,SOJEF,As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
100296,L536532,u2980,m195,PICARD,"No, we're here to... rescue them."
100297,L536531,u2985,m195,SOJEF,Would you like something to eat?
100298,L536530,u2980,m195,PICARD,Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
100299,L536529,u2985,m195,SOJEF,"My name is Sojef, Captain."
100300,L536981,u2980,m195,PICARD,I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
100301,L536980,u2989,m195,WORF'S COM VOICE,We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
100302,L536979,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Worf, you must hurry..."
100303,L536976,u2989,m195,WORF'S COM VOICE,"We're trying to get to you, sir..."
100304,L536975,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Yes... yes, I... can hear you..."
100305,L536974,u2989,m195,WORF'S COM VOICE,Worf to Picard...
100306,L536449,u2980,m195,PICARD,We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
100307,L536448,u2989,m195,WORF'S COM VOICE,I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
100308,L536412,u2980,m195,PICARD,Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
100309,L536411,u2989,m195,WORF'S COM VOICE,Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
100310,L537099,u2980,m195,PICARD,Is there any other way to disable the injector?
100311,L537098,u2988,m195,WORF,Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
100312,L537097,u2980,m195,PICARD,Can you beam him off?
100313,L537096,u2988,m195,WORF,One. It's Ru'afo.
100314,L537075,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf."
100315,L537074,u2988,m195,WORF,All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
100316,L536891,u2980,m195,PICARD,We have to find shelter...
100317,L536890,u2988,m195,WORF,Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
100318,L536861,u2980,m195,PICARD,Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
100319,L536860,u2988,m195,WORF,"The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers..."
100320,L536857,u2988,m195,WORF,Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
100321,L536856,u2980,m195,PICARD,"You need a haircut, Commander."
100322,L536803,u2980,m195,PICARD,"No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf."
100323,L536802,u2988,m195,WORF,"Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?"
100324,L536678,u2980,m195,PICARD,Picard to Crusher...
100325,L536677,u2988,m195,WORF,Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
100326,L536669,u2980,m195,PICARD,Gorch?
100327,L536668,u2988,m195,WORF,"No, sir. It is a gorch."
100328,L536667,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?"
100329,L536666,u2988,m195,WORF,"No, sir..."
100330,L536665,u2980,m195,PICARD,Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
100331,L536515,u2980,m195,PICARD,Transferring controls to manual.
100332,L536514,u2988,m195,WORF,The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
100333,L536510,u2980,m195,PICARD,I'm not letting go of him.
100334,L536509,u2988,m195,WORF,"Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels..."
100335,L536494,u2980,m195,PICARD,"They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  ""A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."""
100336,L536493,u2988,m195,WORF,"No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back..."
100337,L536492,u2980,m195,PICARD,Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
100338,L536490,u2980,m195,PICARD,Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
100339,L536489,u2988,m195,WORF,Scanners are off line!
100340,L536487,u2980,m195,PICARD,Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
100341,L536486,u2988,m195,WORF,He's activated a transport inhibitor.
100342,L536485,u2980,m195,PICARD,Beam him out!
100343,L536484,u2988,m195,WORF,Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
100344,L536483,u2980,m195,PICARD,Make it so.
100345,L536482,u2988,m195,WORF,"Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out..."
100346,L536478,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to..."
100347,L536477,u2988,m195,WORF,Sir?
100348,L536476,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Come out, come out wherever you are..."
100349,L536475,u2980,m195,PICARD,"The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf..."
100350,L536474,u2988,m195,WORF,He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
100351,L536473,u2980,m195,PICARD,Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
100352,L536472,u2988,m195,WORF,Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
100353,L536418,u2980,m195,PICARD,"It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in."
100354,L536417,u2988,m195,WORF,I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
100355,L536353,u2980,m195,PICARD,"Worf, what the hell are you doing here?"
100356,L536352,u2988,m195,WORF,Captain...
100357,L536528,u2987,m195,TROI,"They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline..."
100358,L536527,u2980,m195,PICARD,Counselor?
100359,L536416,u2980,m195,PICARD,"You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data."
100360,L536415,u2987,m195,TROI,We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
100361,L536332,u2980,m195,PICARD,Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
100362,L536331,u2987,m195,TROI,"Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here..."
100363,L536325,u2987,m195,TROI,Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
100364,L536324,u2980,m195,PICARD,Say the greeting again...
100365,L536323,u2987,m195,TROI,... Population three hundred million...
100366,L536883,u2987,m195,TROI,And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
100367,L536882,u2982,m195,RIKER,All hands. Battle stations!
100368,L536575,u2987,m195,TROI,I never kissed you with a beard before.
100369,L536574,u2982,m195,RIKER,Augh?
100370,L536573,u2987,m195,TROI,Augh.
100371,L536572,u2987,m195,TROI,"On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does."
100372,L536571,u2982,m195,RIKER,"What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?"
100373,L536570,u2987,m195,TROI,... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
100374,L536569,u2982,m195,RIKER,... I'm not sleeping well...
100375,L536568,u2987,m195,TROI,... I believe you...
100376,L536567,u2982,m195,RIKER,Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
100377,L536565,u2987,m195,TROI,You're in quite a mood today.
100378,L536564,u2982,m195,RIKER,Or you could try lying down.
100379,L536563,u2987,m195,TROI,Why don't you try sitting up?
100380,L536562,u2982,m195,RIKER,But it's comfortable.
100381,L536561,u2987,m195,TROI,This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
100382,L536560,u2987,m195,TROI,Whatever makes you comfortable...
100383,L536559,u2982,m195,RIKER,Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
100384,L536558,u2987,m195,TROI,Come in.  Hi.
100385,L536440,u2982,m195,RIKER,"If that's true, they're a dying race."
100386,L536439,u2987,m195,TROI,No children?
100387,L536438,u2982,m195,RIKER,It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
100388,L536437,u2987,m195,TROI,Was I doing something to your neck?
100389,L536436,u2982,m195,RIKER,What you're doing to my neck...
100390,L536435,u2987,m195,TROI,What...?
100391,L536434,u2982,m195,RIKER,You haven't done that in a long time...
100392,L536433,u2982,m195,RIKER,Good question.
100393,L536432,u2987,m195,TROI,Why would we be involved with these people?
100394,L536429,u2982,m195,RIKER,You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
100395,L536428,u2987,m195,TROI,"Hmm, I should feel right at home with them..."
100396,L536427,u2982,m195,RIKER,"Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels..."
100397,L536426,u2987,m195,TROI,You should feel right at home with them.
100398,L536425,u2982,m195,RIKER,"Wine, women and song."
100399,L536424,u2987,m195,TROI,What are they interested in...?
100400,L536423,u2982,m195,RIKER,I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
100401,L536421,u2987,m195,TROI,"""Environmental concerns"", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind..."
100402,L536420,u2982,m195,RIKER,Why was Data assigned?
100403,L536419,u2987,m195,TROI,The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
100404,L537083,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
100405,L537082,u2986,m195,SON'A OFFICER #2,They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
100406,L537081,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
100407,L537068,u2986,m195,SON'A OFFICER #2,All ship functions are off-line.
100408,L537067,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
100409,L537066,u2986,m195,SON'A OFFICER #2,"Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels..."
100410,L537065,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Exactly as the simulations predicted...
100411,L537042,u2986,m195,SON'A OFFICER #2,Activating injector assembly.
100412,L537041,u2984,m195,RU'AFO,Initiate launch sequence.
100413,L540238,u2990,m196,ADMIRAL HAYES,I look forward to reading your report.
100414,L540237,u2997,m196,PICARD,"We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain."
100415,L540236,u2990,m196,ADMIRAL HAYES,It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
100416,L540235,u2997,m196,PICARD,Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
100417,L539574,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp."
100418,L539573,u2990,m196,ADMIRAL HAYES,Good hunting. Hayes out.
100419,L539572,u2997,m196,PICARD,Absolutely.
100420,L539571,u2990,m196,ADMIRAL HAYES,"The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?"
100421,L540019,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,"I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our ""sense of duty."" We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not."
100422,L540018,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I..."
100423,L540017,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
100424,L540016,u2997,m196,PICARD,Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
100425,L540013,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,That might not be so bad... at least for you.
100426,L540012,u2997,m196,PICARD,If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
100427,L540011,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,You think they're still up there?
100428,L540010,u2997,m196,PICARD,Not yet.
100429,L540009,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,"He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?"
100430,L540008,u2997,m196,PICARD,How did Doctor Almack react to that?
100431,L540007,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
100432,L540006,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
100433,L540005,u2997,m196,PICARD,You actually performed surgery...?
100434,L539788,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
100435,L539787,u2997,m196,PICARD,I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
100436,L539774,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,That'll be interesting.
100437,L539773,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got."
100438,L539772,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
100439,L539721,u2997,m196,PICARD,Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
100440,L539720,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,There must be some good people... even in this time.
100441,L539719,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
100442,L539718,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,Are you saying they won't help us?
100443,L539717,u2997,m196,PICARD,It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
100444,L539716,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,What are we waiting for? Let's go.
100445,L539715,u2997,m196,PICARD,"As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital..."
100446,L539714,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,"Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now."
100447,L539713,u2997,m196,PICARD,It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
100448,L539708,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
100449,L539707,u2997,m196,PICARD,It's Cochrane.
100450,L539661,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,"Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?"
100451,L539660,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
100452,L539659,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,"But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?"
100453,L539658,u2997,m196,PICARD,Yes...
100454,L539657,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
100455,L539656,u2997,m196,PICARD,We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
100456,L539655,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
100457,L539651,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,"Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --"
100458,L539650,u2997,m196,PICARD,Montana.  Energize.
100459,L539906,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,"I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage."
100460,L539905,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
100461,L539761,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,Bag him.
100462,L539760,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
100463,L539755,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
100464,L539754,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
100465,L539753,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,Is it Japanese?
100466,L539746,u2991,m196,BEVERLY,At least four hours.
100467,L539745,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,How long has he been unconscious?
100468,L540182,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Do it.
100469,L540181,u2993,m196,DATA,I believe so.
100470,L540180,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Can you configure it?
100471,L540179,u2993,m196,DATA,The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
100472,L540178,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
100473,L540163,u2993,m196,DATA,No.
100474,L540162,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Vulcan?
100475,L540161,u2993,m196,DATA,There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
100476,L540142,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
100477,L540141,u2993,m196,DATA,"No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it..."
100478,L540140,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
100479,L540139,u2993,m196,DATA,Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
100480,L540138,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Isn't it better like this...?
100481,L540136,u2993,m196,DATA,"No... no, please... you cannot..."
100482,L540135,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,"I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now."
100483,L540133,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
100484,L540132,u2993,m196,DATA,Yes...
100485,L540131,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
100486,L540130,u2993,m196,DATA,I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
100487,L540036,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,I'm your creator now.
100488,L540035,u2993,m196,DATA,My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
100489,L540034,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
100490,L540033,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,More lies.
100491,L540032,u2993,m196,DATA,I wish to... go back to the way I was.
100492,L540031,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,"You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie."
100493,L540030,u2993,m196,DATA,I... do not want this...
100494,L540029,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
100495,L540028,u2993,m196,DATA,That is not true. They have tried to help me.
100496,L540027,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
100497,L540026,u2993,m196,DATA,No. I will not betray my friends.
100498,L539932,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
100499,L539931,u2993,m196,DATA,It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
100500,L539930,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,"Do you know what this is, Data?"
100501,L539929,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
100502,L539928,u2993,m196,DATA,I do not know what you are referring to.
100503,L539927,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
100504,L539864,u2993,m196,DATA,It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
100505,L539863,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
100506,L539858,u2992,m196,BORG QUEEN,Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
100507,L539857,u2993,m196,DATA,You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
100508,L539637,u2993,m196,DATA,"Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five."
100509,L539636,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo."
100510,L539620,u2993,m196,DATA,According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
100511,L539619,u2997,m196,PICARD,What year is it?
100512,L539595,u2997,m196,PICARD,Contact Starfleet Command.
100513,L539594,u2993,m196,DATA,"The vortex is collapsing, sir."
100514,L539592,u2997,m196,PICARD,Where's the Sphere?
100515,L539591,u2993,m196,DATA,I have helm control.
100516,L539578,u2997,m196,PICARD,What?
100517,L539577,u2993,m196,DATA,It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
100518,L539576,u2997,m196,PICARD,Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
100519,L539575,u2993,m196,DATA,"We are approaching the Terran System, Captain."
100520,L539555,u2997,m196,PICARD,Ready quantum torpedo.
100521,L539554,u2993,m196,DATA,"The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective."
100522,L539550,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery."
100523,L539549,u2993,m196,DATA,Dispersive armor is holding.
100524,L539856,u3004,m196,WOMAN'S VOICE,I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
100525,L539855,u2993,m196,DATA,That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
100526,L539854,u3004,m196,WOMAN'S VOICE,I am the Borg.
100527,L539853,u2993,m196,DATA,Who are you?
100528,L539744,u3004,m196,WOMAN'S VOICE,You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
100529,L539743,u2993,m196,DATA,"I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed."
100530,L539742,u3004,m196,WOMAN'S VOICE,But now... they are all one with the Borg.
100531,L539670,u3003,m196,TROI,I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
100532,L539669,u2993,m196,DATA,"No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I."
100533,L539668,u3003,m196,TROI,We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
100534,L539667,u2993,m196,DATA,"I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse..."
100535,L539666,u3003,m196,TROI,Data... are you sure you're all right?
100536,L539665,u2993,m196,DATA,Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
100537,L539664,u3003,m196,TROI,Did you know her?
100538,L539602,u3003,m196,TROI,But how?
100539,L539601,u2993,m196,DATA,The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
100540,L539771,u2997,m196,PICARD,Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
100541,L539770,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,What did you do to the batteries?
100542,L539766,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,"Outside, around back. Next to the water tank."
100543,L539765,u2997,m196,PICARD,Where?
100544,L539764,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,"I told you, there's no --"
100545,L539763,u2997,m196,PICARD,Where's the battery room for the hospital?
100546,L539757,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
100547,L539756,u2997,m196,PICARD,Juice?
100548,L539750,u2997,m196,PICARD,Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
100549,L539749,u2994,m196,DOCTOR,"""APR cell count?"" What the hell are you talking about?"
100550,L540185,u2997,m196,PICARD,We're crossing the threshold!
100551,L540184,u2995,m196,GEORDI,They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
100552,L540174,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help."
100553,L540173,u2997,m196,PICARD,Their com system must still be down.
100554,L540172,u2997,m196,PICARD,Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
100555,L540171,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"Captain, the Enterprise!"
100556,L540170,u2997,m196,PICARD,One minute to warp threshold...
100557,L540169,u2995,m196,GEORDI,There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
100558,L540168,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second."
100559,L540167,u2995,m196,GEORDI,The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
100560,L540166,u2995,m196,GEORDI,I'm on it...
100561,L540165,u2997,m196,PICARD,Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
100562,L540149,u2997,m196,PICARD,<U>Engage.</U>
100563,L540148,u2995,m196,GEORDI,The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
100564,L540147,u2997,m196,PICARD,Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
100565,L540146,u2995,m196,GEORDI,The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
100566,L540145,u2997,m196,PICARD,As they used to say... all systems are go.
100567,L540144,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
100568,L540127,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
100569,L540126,u2997,m196,PICARD,There's a red light on the second intake valve.
100570,L540125,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Entering the upper ionospere...
100571,L540124,u2997,m196,PICARD,Altitude fifty kilometers...
100572,L540123,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
100573,L540097,u2997,m196,PICARD,Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
100574,L540096,u2995,m196,GEORDI,What's still there?
100575,L540095,u2997,m196,PICARD,Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
100576,L540094,u2995,m196,GEORDI,No... the door's too thick.
100577,L540092,u2997,m196,PICARD,It'll have to wait. Come on.
100578,L540091,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
100579,L540089,u2997,m196,PICARD,This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
100580,L540088,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Captain --
100581,L540070,u2997,m196,PICARD,She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
100582,L540069,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
100583,L540068,u2997,m196,PICARD,We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
100584,L540064,u2997,m196,PICARD,Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
100585,L540063,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Always am.
100586,L540062,u2997,m196,PICARD,Ready to make a little history?
100587,L539983,u2995,m196,GEORDI,They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
100588,L539982,u2997,m196,PICARD,Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
100589,L539851,u2997,m196,PICARD,If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
100590,L539850,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos."
100591,L539844,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing."
100592,L539843,u2997,m196,PICARD,We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
100593,L539842,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
100594,L539841,u2997,m196,PICARD,Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
100595,L539840,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship."
100596,L539710,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface."
100597,L539709,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond."
100598,L539701,u2997,m196,PICARD,There should be some kind of manual release...
100599,L539700,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
100600,L539695,u2997,m196,PICARD,I have the password right here.
100601,L539694,u2995,m196,GEORDI,Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
100602,L539692,u2997,m196,PICARD,There should be an access hatch nearby...
100603,L539691,u2995,m196,GEORDI,I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
100604,L539689,u2997,m196,PICARD,Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
100605,L539688,u2995,m196,GEORDI,I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
100606,L539687,u2997,m196,PICARD,How serious is the damage?
100607,L539686,u2995,m196,GEORDI,This must be it.
100608,L539654,u2997,m196,PICARD,Let's go.
100609,L539653,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters."
100610,L539560,u2997,m196,PICARD,Understood. Keep me informed.
100611,L539559,u2995,m196,GEORDI,"Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up."
100612,L540057,u2996,m196,GEORDI'S VOICE,Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
100613,L540056,u2998,m196,PICARD'S VOICE,Ready.
100614,L540055,u2996,m196,GEORDI'S VOICE,Main bus...
100615,L540054,u2998,m196,PICARD'S VOICE,Active.
100616,L540053,u2996,m196,GEORDI'S VOICE,ATR setting...
100617,L539991,u2998,m196,PICARD'S VOICE,"Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again."
100618,L539990,u2996,m196,GEORDI'S VOICE,"I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it."
100619,L539989,u2998,m196,PICARD'S VOICE,What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
100620,L539988,u2996,m196,GEORDI'S VOICE,"It'll be tight, but we should make it."
100621,L539987,u2998,m196,PICARD'S VOICE,Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
100622,L540112,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
100623,L540111,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
100624,L540110,u2997,m196,PICARD,"From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears."
100625,L540107,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,"Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again."
100626,L540106,u2997,m196,PICARD,There is no invasion...
100627,L540102,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,"These people you're calling ""Vulcans""... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?"
100628,L540101,u2997,m196,PICARD,Invasion.
100629,L540100,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,The invasion plans.
100630,L540099,u2997,m196,PICARD,What do you want?
100631,L539817,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Not yet.
100632,L539816,u2997,m196,PICARD,Something wrong with that?
100633,L539815,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,You seem to have an answer for everything.
100634,L539814,u2997,m196,PICARD,I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
100635,L539813,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
100636,L539812,u2997,m196,PICARD,Yes.
100637,L539811,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
100638,L539810,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
100639,L539809,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
100640,L539808,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Huh.
100641,L539807,u2997,m196,PICARD,It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
100642,L539806,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
100643,L539805,u2997,m196,PICARD,There's a few of us left.
100644,L539804,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,"Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there."
100645,L539803,u2997,m196,PICARD,California. San Francisco.
100646,L539802,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Where are you from most recently?
100647,L539801,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
100648,L539800,u2997,m196,PICARD,Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
100649,L539799,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Where in the States?
100650,L539797,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,You don't sound French.
100651,L539796,u2997,m196,PICARD,Yes.
100652,L539795,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,Great name. French?
100653,L539794,u2997,m196,PICARD,Jean-Luc Picard.
100654,L539793,u3002,m196,SCRIMM,"Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?"
100655,L539792,u2997,m196,PICARD,Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
100656,L540217,u3001,m196,RUBY,You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
100657,L540216,u2997,m196,PICARD,"This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary."
100658,L540215,u3001,m196,RUBY,Why?
100659,L540214,u2997,m196,PICARD,That's impossible.
100660,L540213,u3001,m196,RUBY,I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
100661,L540212,u2997,m196,PICARD,No... I'm from France.
100662,L540211,u3001,m196,RUBY,"It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here."
100663,L540210,u2997,m196,PICARD,No. It's a lot further than that.
100664,L540209,u3001,m196,RUBY,Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
100665,L540208,u2997,m196,PICARD,I have to...
100666,L540207,u3001,m196,RUBY,"You're leaving, aren't you?"
100667,L539955,u2997,m196,PICARD,I am not a thief...
100668,L539954,u3001,m196,RUBY,"And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship."
100669,L539953,u2997,m196,PICARD,Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
100670,L539950,u3001,m196,RUBY,Or...?
100671,L539949,u2997,m196,PICARD,We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
100672,L539948,u3001,m196,RUBY,All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
100673,L539947,u2997,m196,PICARD,A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
100674,L539946,u3001,m196,RUBY,Lie. That's one. Keep going.
100675,L539945,u2997,m196,PICARD,Some.
100676,L539944,u3001,m196,RUBY,Friends from Cornell...
100677,L539943,u2997,m196,PICARD,Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
100678,L539942,u3001,m196,RUBY,We?
100679,L539941,u2997,m196,PICARD,We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
100680,L539940,u3001,m196,RUBY,"Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house."
100681,L539939,u3001,m196,RUBY,Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
100682,L539938,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'd say you already have.
100683,L539917,u3001,m196,RUBY,"Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies."
100684,L539916,u2997,m196,PICARD,It can't wait until tomorrow...
100685,L539915,u3001,m196,RUBY,I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
100686,L539914,u2997,m196,PICARD,Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
100687,L539909,u2997,m196,PICARD,How did you know about that?
100688,L539908,u3001,m196,RUBY,No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
100689,L539907,u2997,m196,PICARD,Were the two of you... involved?
100690,L539903,u2997,m196,PICARD,Are you always sucha good judge of character?
100691,L539902,u3001,m196,RUBY,You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
100692,L539901,u2997,m196,PICARD,What makes you say that?
100693,L539900,u3001,m196,RUBY,You're lying.
100694,L539899,u2997,m196,PICARD,What?
100695,L539898,u3001,m196,RUBY,'Fraid not.
100696,L539897,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
100697,L539896,u3001,m196,RUBY,Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
100698,L539895,u2997,m196,PICARD,"No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs."
100699,L539894,u3001,m196,RUBY,"You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?"
100700,L539893,u2997,m196,PICARD,I can try.
100701,L539892,u3001,m196,RUBY,"""Money."" So you can get dome money..."
100702,L539889,u2997,m196,PICARD,Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
100703,L539888,u3001,m196,RUBY,"Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years."
100704,L539887,u2997,m196,PICARD,Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
100705,L539886,u3001,m196,RUBY,Did you need something?
100706,L539884,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'm very sorry.
100707,L539883,u3001,m196,RUBY,Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
100708,L539882,u2997,m196,PICARD,Cochrane?
100709,L539881,u3001,m196,RUBY,Thank God this plate was already fixed.
100710,L539880,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --"
100711,L539879,u3001,m196,RUBY,"What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?"
100712,L539780,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Yes, he is."
100713,L539779,u3001,m196,RUBY,Take care of him. He's a very special man.
100714,L539626,u3003,m196,TROI,Western hemisphere... North American continent...
100715,L539625,u2997,m196,PICARD,Track their weapons fire.
100716,L539610,u2997,m196,PICARD,We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
100717,L539609,u3003,m196,TROI,Captain...?
100718,L539600,u3003,m196,TROI,Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
100719,L539599,u2997,m196,PICARD,Life signs?
100720,L539562,u2997,m196,PICARD,On screen.
100721,L539561,u3003,m196,TROI,Incoming transmission from the Borg.
100722,L539548,u3003,m196,TROI,"Aye, sir."
100723,L539547,u2997,m196,PICARD,Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
100724,L540234,u2997,m196,PICARD,Onscreen.
100725,L540233,u3005,m196,WORF,Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
100726,L539642,u3005,m196,WORF,"Aye, sir."
100727,L539641,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes."
100728,L539635,u2997,m196,PICARD,Fire!
100729,L539634,u3005,m196,WORF,Target locked!
100730,L539624,u2997,m196,PICARD,Go to manual.
100731,L539623,u3005,m196,WORF,Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
100732,L539622,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?"
100733,L539621,u3005,m196,WORF,"Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface."
100734,L539613,u2997,m196,PICARD,Steady as she goes.
100735,L539612,u3005,m196,WORF,Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
100736,L539608,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Data, set a course for that vortex."
100737,L539607,u3005,m196,WORF,"Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position."
100738,L539584,u3005,m196,WORF,"Aye, sir."
100739,L539583,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!"
100740,L539552,u2997,m196,PICARD,Fire.
100741,L539551,u3005,m196,WORF,"Port battery, ready sir!"
100742,L540231,u2999,m196,RIKER,"No, sir."
100743,L540230,u2997,m196,PICARD,Unless you'd like to stay.
100744,L540229,u2999,m196,RIKER,"Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?"
100745,L540228,u2997,m196,PICARD,Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
100746,L540227,u2999,m196,RIKER,"Yes, sir."
100747,L540226,u2997,m196,PICARD,Return to our own time?
100748,L539648,u2997,m196,PICARD,I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
100749,L539647,u2999,m196,RIKER,"Good luck, sir."
100750,L539646,u2997,m196,PICARD,"Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian."
100751,L539645,u2999,m196,RIKER,"And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down..."
100752,L539644,u2997,m196,PICARD,"In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship."
100753,L539643,u2999,m196,RIKER,Captain?
100754,L539640,u2999,m196,RIKER,Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
100755,L539639,u2997,m196,PICARD,Life signs?
100756,L539638,u2999,m196,RIKER,Looks like they damaged the silo...
100757,L539618,u2997,m196,PICARD,On screen.
100758,L539617,u2999,m196,RIKER,We're still in Earth orbit.
100759,L539616,u2997,m196,PICARD,Report.
100760,L539604,u2999,m196,RIKER,They did it... they assimilated Earth.
100761,L539603,u2997,m196,PICARD,They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
100762,L539590,u2997,m196,PICARD,Worf... torpedo... now!
100763,L539589,u2999,m196,RIKER,We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
100764,L540158,u3005,m196,WORF,Nothing.
100765,L540157,u2999,m196,RIKER,Emergency override!
100766,L540156,u3005,m196,WORF,We've lost Bridge control!
100767,L540155,u2999,m196,RIKER,Report!
100768,L540052,u3005,m196,WORF,Understood!
100769,L540051,u2999,m196,RIKER,Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
100770,L540049,u2999,m196,RIKER,I'll keep that in mind.
100771,L540048,u3005,m196,WORF,"And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant."
100772,L540047,u2999,m196,RIKER,Right.
100773,L540046,u3005,m196,WORF,Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
100774,L540045,u2999,m196,RIKER,Just a little queasy...
100775,L540044,u3005,m196,WORF,Are you alright?
100776,L540039,u3005,m196,WORF,The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
100777,L540038,u2999,m196,RIKER,I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
100778,L540037,u3005,m196,WORF,You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
100779,L539974,u3005,m196,WORF,Destroy the deflector dish.
100780,L539973,u2999,m196,RIKER,Agreed. Options?
100781,L539972,u3005,m196,WORF,We have to stop them from sending that message.
100782,L539968,u3005,m196,WORF,They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
100783,L539967,u2999,m196,RIKER,They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
100784,L539966,u2999,m196,RIKER,Computer -- thermal enhancement.
100785,L539965,u3005,m196,WORF,They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
100786,L539960,u3005,m196,WORF,They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
100787,L539959,u2999,m196,RIKER,What are they doing?
100788,L539877,u2999,m196,RIKER,"We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in."
100789,L539876,u3005,m196,WORF,"To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge."
100790,L539871,u2999,m196,RIKER,We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
100791,L539870,u3005,m196,WORF,We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
100792,L539733,u3005,m196,WORF,It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
100793,L539732,u2999,m196,RIKER,"What the hell is happening, Worf?"
100794,L539730,u2999,m196,RIKER,What?
100795,L539729,u3005,m196,WORF,A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
100796,L539723,u2999,m196,RIKER,Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
100797,L539722,u3005,m196,WORF,"I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success."
100798,L539569,u3005,m196,WORF,Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
100799,L539568,u2999,m196,RIKER,"Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious."
100800,L540153,u2999,m196,RIKER,Hold that thought.
100801,L540152,u3003,m196,TROI,I have to admit there was a moment there when --
100802,L539980,u2999,m196,RIKER,I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
100803,L539979,u3003,m196,TROI,What are you suggesting?
100804,L539978,u2999,m196,RIKER,I remember it made me sick.
100805,L539962,u2999,m196,RIKER,Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
100806,L539961,u3003,m196,TROI,"To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay..."
100807,L539925,u2999,m196,RIKER,Where the hell are they going?
100808,L539924,u3003,m196,TROI,They're bypassing Engineering...
100809,L539869,u3003,m196,TROI,Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
100810,L539868,u2999,m196,RIKER,All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
100811,L539737,u2999,m196,RIKER,"Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg."
100812,L539736,u3003,m196,TROI,Wil... Data was down there.
100813,L539735,u2999,m196,RIKER,The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
100814,L539734,u3003,m196,TROI,Someone...?
100815,L539728,u3003,m196,TROI,We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
100816,L539727,u2999,m196,RIKER,Report.
100817,L539838,u3005,m196,WORF,Commander... we have a problem.
100818,L539837,u3000,m196,RIKER'S COM VOICE,"What the hell happened down there, Worf?"
100819,L539832,u3005,m196,WORF,"Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back."
100820,L539831,u3000,m196,RIKER'S COM VOICE,Worf? Is something wrong?
100821,L539828,u3000,m196,RIKER'S COM VOICE,"Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?"
100822,L539827,u3005,m196,WORF,Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
100823,L539824,u3005,m196,WORF,There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
100824,L539823,u3000,m196,RIKER'S COM VOICE,Riker here.
100825,L539822,u3005,m196,WORF,Worf to Bridge.
100826,L539970,u3005,m196,WORF,What kind of message?
100827,L539969,u3003,m196,TROI,They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
100828,L539873,u3005,m196,WORF,"Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols..."
100829,L539872,u3003,m196,TROI,Even Data?
100830,L539725,u3005,m196,WORF,There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
100831,L539724,u3003,m196,TROI,Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
100832,L539632,u3005,m196,WORF,Target...
100833,L539631,u3003,m196,TROI,"Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana."
100834,L539597,u3003,m196,TROI,"Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well."
100835,L539596,u3005,m196,WORF,No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
100836,L538174,u3017,m197,PRESIDENT,"I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all."
100837,L538173,u3006,m197,ADMIRAL DONALD,"The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President."
100838,L538172,u3017,m197,PRESIDENT,I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
100839,L538167,u3017,m197,PRESIDENT,At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
100840,L538166,u3006,m197,ADMIRAL DONALD,Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
100841,L538165,u3017,m197,PRESIDENT,Admiral Donald...Bill...
100842,L538164,u3006,m197,ADMIRAL DONALD,Mr. President.
100843,L538792,u3007,m197,BONES,That's the question -
100844,L538791,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Or not to be -
100845,L538749,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor..."
100846,L538748,u3007,m197,BONES,"Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock..."
100847,L538747,u3007,m197,BONES,"Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!"
100848,L538746,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete..."
100849,L538738,u3020,m197,SPOCK,We DO sleep lying down.
100850,L538737,u3007,m197,BONES,"Spock, that was actually funny."
100851,L538736,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Vulcans sleep lying down...
100852,L538735,u3007,m197,BONES,Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
100853,L538731,u3007,m197,BONES,Fascinating...
100854,L538730,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"You may need assistance, doctor..."
100855,L538729,u3007,m197,BONES,I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
100856,L538582,u3020,m197,SPOCK,The charge is murder.
100857,L538581,u3007,m197,BONES,I believe the operation is over.
100858,L538104,u3007,m197,BONES,I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
100859,L538103,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Good luck, Captain."
100860,L538790,u3012,m197,KIRK,To be -
100861,L538789,u3007,m197,BONES,And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
100862,L538788,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it."
100863,L538557,u3012,m197,KIRK,Come on...
100864,L538556,u3007,m197,BONES,ABSOLUTELY NOT!
100865,L538545,u3012,m197,KIRK,Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
100866,L538544,u3007,m197,BONES,Damned clever if you ask me...
100867,L538526,u3012,m197,KIRK,She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
100868,L538525,u3007,m197,BONES,ARE YOU CRAZY?
100869,L538515,u3012,m197,KIRK,Spock's looking for us...
100870,L538514,u3007,m197,BONES,If they're even looking for us...
100871,L538513,u3012,m197,KIRK,Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
100872,L538512,u3007,m197,BONES,That cunning little Vulcan...
100873,L538511,u3012,m197,KIRK,It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
100874,L538510,u3012,m197,KIRK,No way.  You see this?
100875,L538509,u3007,m197,BONES,"Jim, leave me - I'm finished..."
100876,L538489,u3012,m197,KIRK,Don't remind me.
100877,L538488,u3007,m197,BONES,What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
100878,L538470,u3007,m197,BONES,More than ever.
100879,L538469,u3012,m197,KIRK,Still think we're finished?
100880,L538468,u3007,m197,BONES,"What is it with you, anyway?"
100881,L538456,u3007,m197,BONES,"Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -"
100882,L538455,u3012,m197,KIRK,Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
100883,L538454,u3007,m197,BONES,"Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -"
100884,L538453,u3012,m197,KIRK,No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
100885,L538452,u3007,m197,BONES,Specifically of...?
100886,L538451,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened."
100887,L538450,u3007,m197,BONES,Are we playing multiple choice?
100888,L538449,u3012,m197,KIRK,I didn't mean this future.
100889,L538448,u3007,m197,BONES,That was the general idea I intended to convey.
100890,L538447,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Bones, are you afraid of the future?"
100891,L538446,u3007,m197,BONES,- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
100892,L538445,u3007,m197,BONES,Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
100893,L538444,u3012,m197,KIRK,We're not finished.
100894,L538443,u3007,m197,BONES,Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
100895,L538432,u3007,m197,BONES,Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
100896,L538431,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge."
100897,L538396,u3012,m197,KIRK,We've been set up all along.
100898,L538395,u3007,m197,BONES,Figures.
100899,L538390,u3007,m197,BONES,What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
100900,L538389,u3012,m197,KIRK,Thanks...
100901,L538129,u3007,m197,BONES,"Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?"
100902,L538128,u3012,m197,KIRK,No!
100903,L538125,u3007,m197,BONES,"Jim, I don't even know his anatomy."
100904,L538124,u3012,m197,KIRK,Can you - ?
100905,L538123,u3007,m197,BONES,Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
100906,L538097,u3012,m197,KIRK,I wish I knew. Uhura?
100907,L538096,u3007,m197,BONES,What the Hell's going on?
100908,L537921,u3012,m197,KIRK,"You heard the order, Lieutenant."
100909,L537920,u3007,m197,BONES,"Uh, Jim..."
100910,L538777,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
100911,L538776,u3007,m197,BONES,They don't arrest people for having feelings.
100912,L538722,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"In space, no one can hear you sweat."
100913,L538721,u3007,m197,BONES,Too bad we can't SMELL her.
100914,L538698,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?"
100915,L538697,u3007,m197,BONES,This is fun...
100916,L538672,u3007,m197,BONES,Now there's a poser.
100917,L538671,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?"
100918,L538031,u3007,m197,BONES,"Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of ""exploration""..."
100919,L538030,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,We're explorers not diplomats!
100920,L538010,u3007,m197,BONES,And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
100921,L538009,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
100922,L538283,u3008,m197,CHANG,The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
100923,L538282,u3007,m197,BONES,I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
100924,L538281,u3008,m197,CHANG,You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
100925,L538280,u3007,m197,BONES,I was nervous -
100926,L538277,u3008,m197,CHANG,You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
100927,L538276,u3007,m197,BONES,I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
100928,L538275,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Have you saved patients as ""barely"" alive as he was?"
100929,L538274,u3007,m197,BONES,Barely.
100930,L538273,u3008,m197,CHANG,Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
100931,L538268,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?"
100932,L538267,u3007,m197,BONES,Retire.
100933,L538266,u3008,m197,CHANG,Stand...?
100934,L538265,u3007,m197,BONES,For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
100935,L538264,u3007,m197,BONES,"Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good."
100936,L538263,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?"
100937,L538121,u3007,m197,BONES,Then let me help!
100938,L538120,u3008,m197,CHANG,We were until your torpedoes!
100939,L538119,u3007,m197,BONES,Are you carrying a surgeon?
100940,L538523,u3014,m197,MARTIA,"I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk."
100941,L538522,u3007,m197,BONES,I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
100942,L538521,u3014,m197,MARTIA,It takes a lot of effort.
100943,L538427,u3007,m197,BONES,That's a comfort...
100944,L538426,u3014,m197,MARTIA,They'll respect him now...
100945,L538403,u3014,m197,MARTIA,I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
100946,L538402,u3007,m197,BONES,"What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?"
100947,L538401,u3014,m197,MARTIA,They'll make it look like an accident...
100948,L538400,u3007,m197,BONES,I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
100949,L538324,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Your honors, the State rests."
100950,L538323,u3012,m197,KIRK,As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
100951,L538320,u3008,m197,CHANG,So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
100952,L538319,u3012,m197,KIRK,I am.
100953,L538318,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?"
100954,L538317,u3012,m197,KIRK,I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
100955,L538316,u3008,m197,CHANG,You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
100956,L538315,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Well, I -"
100957,L538314,u3008,m197,CHANG,You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
100958,L538311,u3008,m197,CHANG,And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
100959,L538310,u3012,m197,KIRK,I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
100960,L538309,u3008,m197,CHANG,For insubordination.
100961,L538308,u3012,m197,KIRK,Yes.
100962,L538307,u3008,m197,CHANG,You were demoted...
100963,L538296,u3012,m197,KIRK,Those words WERE spoken by me.
100964,L538295,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Louder, please. We cannot hear you."
100965,L538294,u3012,m197,KIRK,Yes...
100966,L538293,u3008,m197,CHANG,Spoken by you?
100967,L538292,u3012,m197,KIRK,Yes.
100968,L538291,u3008,m197,CHANG,Are those your words?
100969,L538286,u3008,m197,CHANG,"That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete."
100970,L538285,u3012,m197,KIRK,That isn't true...!
100971,L538284,u3008,m197,CHANG,"And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son."
100972,L538250,u3012,m197,KIRK,That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
100973,L538249,u3008,m197,CHANG,And what did they tell you?
100974,L538248,u3012,m197,KIRK,"I checked the data banks, yes."
100975,L538247,u3008,m197,CHANG,Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
100976,L538246,u3012,m197,KIRK,There... were no other ships in the sector.
100977,L538245,u3008,m197,CHANG,"And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector."
100978,L538244,u3012,m197,KIRK,The drink WAS served...
100979,L538243,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?"
100980,L538242,u3012,m197,KIRK,What?
100981,L538136,u3008,m197,CHANG,Take them away.
100982,L538135,u3012,m197,KIRK,He just tried to save him!
100983,L538134,u3008,m197,CHANG,"Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council."
100984,L538118,u3008,m197,CHANG,How can I trust --
100985,L538117,u3012,m197,KIRK,He's a DOCTOR!
100986,L538115,u3008,m197,CHANG,"You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!"
100987,L538114,u3012,m197,KIRK,WHAT HAPPENED?
100988,L538113,u3008,m197,CHANG,You feign ignorance?
100989,L538112,u3012,m197,KIRK,"My God, what happened here?"
100990,L538001,u3012,m197,KIRK,I beg your pardon?
100991,L538000,u3008,m197,CHANG,"""To be or not to be, that is the question"" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room..."
100992,L537992,u3008,m197,CHANG,Very much.
100993,L537991,u3012,m197,KIRK,Would you care to go topside?
100994,L537981,u3012,m197,KIRK,I'm not sure how to take that.
100995,L537980,u3008,m197,CHANG,"I've always wanted to meet you, Captain."
100996,L538794,u3012,m197,KIRK,Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
100997,L538793,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Course heading, Captain?"
100998,L538733,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Aye, sir; thrusters..."
100999,L538732,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power."
101000,L538692,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Aye, sir; thrusters..."
101001,L538691,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power..."
101002,L538690,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,Shields up. Battle stations.
101003,L538689,u3012,m197,KIRK,Shields. Battle stations.
101004,L538686,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes..."
101005,L538685,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,But if she's cloaked...
101006,L538684,u3012,m197,KIRK,She's here - somewhere.
101007,L538624,u3012,m197,KIRK,She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
101008,L538623,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,Where IS the conference?
101009,L538604,u3012,m197,KIRK,Who else?
101010,L538603,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,From Starfleet?
101011,L538570,u3012,m197,KIRK,First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
101012,L538569,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on ""Stun"" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body..."
101013,L538090,u3012,m197,KIRK,Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
101014,L538089,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --"
101015,L538069,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Uhura, monitor!"
101016,L538068,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,Torpedo room--?
101017,L538065,u3012,m197,KIRK,I know what you mean...
101018,L538064,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,Just the size of my head -
101019,L537994,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov..."
101020,L537993,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??"
101021,L537864,u3012,m197,KIRK,Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
101022,L537863,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,Where is Mr. Sulu?
101023,L538584,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,She programmed the torpedo hits?
101024,L538583,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise."
101025,L538499,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death."
101026,L538498,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered..."
101027,L538476,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,ALL uniforms?
101028,L538475,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
101029,L538474,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,Now we go to Starfleet?
101030,L538473,u3020,m197,SPOCK,This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
101031,L538472,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
101032,L538471,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Klingon blood.
101033,L538369,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"You tell them, Lieutenant."
101034,L538368,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?"
101035,L538367,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here..."
101036,L538083,u3009,m197,CHEKOV,"Shields up, Captain --?"
101037,L538082,u3020,m197,SPOCK,They're preparing to fire.
101038,L538298,u3010,m197,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir."
101039,L538297,u3021,m197,SULU,"Send to commander Enterprise: ""We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior."" Attach our co-ordinates."
101040,L537857,u3021,m197,SULU,Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
101041,L537856,u3010,m197,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Do we report this, sir?"
101042,L537855,u3021,m197,SULU,An INCIDENT?
101043,L537852,u3021,m197,SULU,Onscreen.
101044,L537851,u3010,m197,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command."
101045,L537845,u3021,m197,SULU,"Mr. Valtane, any more data?"
101046,L537844,u3010,m197,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Aye, sir."
101047,L538037,u3012,m197,KIRK,We must do this again soon.
101048,L538036,u3011,m197,GORKON,"Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying."
101049,L537990,u3011,m197,GORKON,"This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel..."
101050,L537989,u3012,m197,KIRK,Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
101051,L537988,u3011,m197,GORKON,Your research laboratory is most impressive...
101052,L537978,u3011,m197,GORKON,"Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks.."
101053,L537977,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer..."
101054,L537967,u3011,m197,GORKON,I shall look forward to it.
101055,L537966,u3012,m197,KIRK,We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
101056,L537965,u3011,m197,GORKON,We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
101057,L537964,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?"
101058,L537963,u3011,m197,GORKON,"Thank you, Captain."
101059,L537962,u3012,m197,KIRK,Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
101060,L537961,u3011,m197,GORKON,This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
101061,L538542,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Not me, idiot - HIM!"
101062,L538541,u3015,m197,MARTIA'S VOICE,Kill him! He's the one!!
101063,L538540,u3012,m197,KIRK,What took you so long?
101064,L538539,u3015,m197,MARTIA'S VOICE,I like it here...
101065,L538538,u3012,m197,KIRK,Isn't it about time you became something else?
101066,L538534,u3015,m197,MARTIA'S VOICE,They'll be here...
101067,L538533,u3012,m197,KIRK,Your friends are late...
101068,L538531,u3015,m197,MARTIA'S VOICE,Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
101069,L538530,u3012,m197,KIRK,An accident wasn't good enough...
101070,L538520,u3015,m197,MARTIA'S VOICE,"Give a girl a chance, Captain."
101071,L538519,u3012,m197,KIRK,"I've heard of chameloids - ""Shapeshifters"" - I thought you were mythical."
101072,L538466,u3012,m197,KIRK,Candidate for what?
101073,L538465,u3014,m197,MARTIA,I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
101074,L538464,u3012,m197,KIRK,Possibly.
101075,L538463,u3014,m197,MARTIA,Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
101076,L538462,u3012,m197,KIRK,Where do we come in?
101077,L538461,u3014,m197,MARTIA,I know how to get outside the shield.
101078,L538460,u3014,m197,MARTIA,It IS possible.
101079,L538459,u3012,m197,KIRK,Except us.
101080,L538458,u3014,m197,MARTIA,Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
101081,L538434,u3012,m197,KIRK,There's gotta be a way out of this place...
101082,L538433,u3014,m197,MARTIA,"When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one."
101083,L538430,u3012,m197,KIRK,Anything else you want to tell me?
101084,L538429,u3014,m197,MARTIA,"That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain."
101085,L538405,u3014,m197,MARTIA,Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
101086,L538404,u3012,m197,KIRK,How much time's left of your sentence?
101087,L538399,u3014,m197,MARTIA,"Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way."
101088,L538398,u3012,m197,KIRK,We didn't kill Gorkon.
101089,L538397,u3014,m197,MARTIA,We don't get many presidential assassins.
101090,L538394,u3014,m197,MARTIA,There's a reward for your death.
101091,L538393,u3012,m197,KIRK,How did you know...?
101092,L538387,u3014,m197,MARTIA,Krandog aranty.
101093,L538386,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway."
101094,L538385,u3014,m197,MARTIA,And your coat.
101095,L538384,u3012,m197,KIRK,He's got it.
101096,L538383,u3014,m197,MARTIA,He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
101097,L538612,u3012,m197,KIRK,WHO ELSE...?
101098,L538611,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,This is incredible -
101099,L538095,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"Aye, sir."
101100,L538094,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order."
101101,L538093,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"Captain, if --"
101102,L538092,u3012,m197,KIRK,Stand down your weapons.
101103,L537975,u3012,m197,KIRK,Energize...
101104,L537974,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
101105,L538642,u3012,m197,KIRK,You hear that?
101106,L538641,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Just the prototype.
101107,L538600,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record."
101108,L538599,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
101109,L538598,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Who is ""US?"""
101110,L538085,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Uhura, signal our surrender."
101111,L538084,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Captain, our shields -- !"
101112,L538063,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?"
101113,L538062,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Sir?
101114,L538061,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?"
101115,L537969,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Captain.
101116,L537968,u3012,m197,KIRK,I hope you're happy.
101117,L537958,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees..."
101118,L537957,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside..."
101119,L537942,u3012,m197,KIRK,Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
101120,L537941,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,I always wanted to try that.
101121,L537940,u3012,m197,KIRK,"You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -"
101122,L537939,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
101123,L537937,u3012,m197,KIRK,Right -
101124,L537936,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
101125,L537935,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -"
101126,L537934,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Sorry -
101127,L537930,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Aye, sir."
101128,L537929,u3012,m197,KIRK,"I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant."
101129,L537928,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Kronos, sir?"
101130,L537927,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant."
101131,L537926,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Aye, sir."
101132,L537919,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?"
101133,L537918,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power..."
101134,L537917,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Aft thrusters -
101135,L537901,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered."
101136,L537900,u3012,m197,KIRK,As you were. Lieutenant...?
101137,L538647,u3021,m197,SULU,"Don't mention it, Captain Kirk."
101138,L538646,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Thank you, Captain Sulu."
101139,L538645,u3021,m197,SULU,"According to my information, today."
101140,L538644,u3012,m197,KIRK,When does this conference start?
101141,L538643,u3021,m197,SULU,"I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim."
101142,L538640,u3012,m197,KIRK,"I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder..."
101143,L538639,u3021,m197,SULU,Surely not.
101144,L538638,u3012,m197,KIRK,I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
101145,L538637,u3021,m197,SULU,"The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency."
101146,L538636,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination."
101147,L538635,u3021,m197,SULU,"I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up."
101148,L538634,u3012,m197,KIRK,"You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain."
101149,L538633,u3021,m197,SULU,"Standing by, Captain Kirk."
101150,L538632,u3012,m197,KIRK,Sulu!
101151,L538631,u3021,m197,SULU,"This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior."
101152,L538779,u3020,m197,SPOCK,... is to trust him.
101153,L538778,u3012,m197,KIRK,The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
101154,L538769,u3012,m197,KIRK,Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
101155,L538768,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
101156,L538767,u3012,m197,KIRK,"But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - ""the undiscovered country""..."
101157,L538704,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her."
101158,L538703,u3012,m197,KIRK,What's she waiting for?
101159,L538688,u3012,m197,KIRK,Make ourselves a target?
101160,L538687,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us."
101161,L538679,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Not yet... Section 4236...
101162,L538678,u3012,m197,KIRK,Close enough to beam down?
101163,L538667,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Spock, you want to know something?"
101164,L538666,u3020,m197,SPOCK,But I am not human. I am only -
101165,L538665,u3012,m197,KIRK,Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
101166,L538664,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I SHOULD have been -
101167,L538663,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter ""S."" You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -"
101168,L538662,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
101169,L538661,u3012,m197,KIRK,Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
101170,L538660,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
101171,L538659,u3012,m197,KIRK,You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
101172,L538658,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
101173,L538657,u3012,m197,KIRK,I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
101174,L538656,u3012,m197,KIRK,"The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us."
101175,L538655,u3020,m197,SPOCK,You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
101176,L538654,u3012,m197,KIRK,Are you dining on worms?
101177,L538629,u3020,m197,SPOCK,The Commander is an old friend of yours.
101178,L538628,u3012,m197,KIRK,Why would they give them to us?
101179,L538627,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates."
101180,L538620,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
101181,L538619,u3012,m197,KIRK,What peace conference?
101182,L538618,u3020,m197,SPOCK,The peace conference.
101183,L538565,u3012,m197,KIRK,"So, that's it.."
101184,L538564,u3020,m197,SPOCK,The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
101185,L538553,u3012,m197,KIRK,He was just about to explain the whole damn -
101186,L538552,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Captain...
101187,L538102,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Perhaps you're right.
101188,L538101,u3012,m197,KIRK,I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
101189,L538100,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
101190,L538079,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice..."
101191,L538078,u3012,m197,KIRK,We HAVEN'T fired -
101192,L538067,u3020,m197,SPOCK,We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
101193,L538066,u3012,m197,KIRK,What the -
101194,L538060,u3012,m197,KIRK,From Enterprise?
101195,L538059,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
101196,L538058,u3012,m197,KIRK,Where?
101197,L538057,u3020,m197,SPOCK,We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
101198,L538056,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Spock, I'm really tired..."
101199,L538055,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I am uncertain.
101200,L538054,u3012,m197,KIRK,What is it?
101201,L538048,u3012,m197,KIRK,I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
101202,L538047,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
101203,L538013,u3012,m197,KIRK,Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
101204,L538012,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
101205,L537956,u3020,m197,SPOCK,The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
101206,L537955,u3012,m197,KIRK,Never been this close.
101207,L537903,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud..."
101208,L537902,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy."
101209,L537892,u3012,m197,KIRK,LET THEM DIE.
101210,L537891,u3020,m197,SPOCK,They're dying.
101211,L537890,u3012,m197,KIRK,DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
101212,L537889,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -"
101213,L537888,u3012,m197,KIRK,"I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals."
101214,L537887,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I was asked by my father to open neg-
101215,L537886,u3012,m197,KIRK,How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
101216,L537885,u3020,m197,SPOCK,There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
101217,L537884,u3012,m197,KIRK,WE volunteered?
101218,L537881,u3012,m197,KIRK,You have personally -
101219,L537880,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain."
101220,L537878,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space."
101221,L537877,u3012,m197,KIRK,Me?
101222,L538720,u3012,m197,KIRK,Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
101223,L538719,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat..."
101224,L538694,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running."
101225,L538693,u3012,m197,KIRK,Uhura?
101226,L538608,u3012,m197,KIRK,Who else?
101227,L538607,u3022,m197,UHURA,Gorkon's own man??
101228,L538099,u3012,m197,KIRK,"I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn."
101229,L538098,u3022,m197,UHURA,It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
101230,L538088,u3022,m197,UHURA,This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
101231,L538087,u3012,m197,KIRK,WE SURRENDER.
101232,L538086,u3022,m197,UHURA,Captain --
101233,L537960,u3012,m197,KIRK,"This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding."
101234,L537959,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Channel open, Captain."
101235,L537912,u3012,m197,KIRK,"Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart."
101236,L537911,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Control tower, reading, Sir."
101237,L538595,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
101238,L538594,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith."
101239,L538588,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,You can't prove any of this...
101240,L538587,u3020,m197,SPOCK,But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
101241,L538579,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I believe you. Please...
101242,L538578,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,I don't want to.
101243,L538577,u3020,m197,SPOCK,If you are logical.
101244,L538421,u3020,m197,SPOCK,An error.
101245,L538420,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,A lie?
101246,L538413,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
101247,L538412,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
101248,L538408,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
101249,L538407,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?"
101250,L538406,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Any progress?
101251,L538233,u3020,m197,SPOCK,An omission. After that -
101252,L538232,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,A lie?
101253,L538231,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
101254,L538230,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
101255,L538229,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?"
101256,L538228,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Not as yet, sir."
101257,L538227,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant."
101258,L538224,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Such things have happened before, sir."
101259,L538223,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Her own father...?
101260,L538146,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes."
101261,L538145,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,How did you - ?
101262,L538142,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid."
101263,L538141,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
101264,L537951,u3020,m197,SPOCK,That the universe will unfold as it should.
101265,L537950,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Faith...?
101266,L537949,u3020,m197,SPOCK,You must have faith.
101267,L537946,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant."
101268,L537945,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?"
101269,L537944,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan."
101270,L538622,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
101271,L538621,u3022,m197,UHURA,We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
101272,L538186,u3022,m197,UHURA,We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
101273,L538185,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,"In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE."
101274,L538184,u3022,m197,UHURA,We've been ordered to -
101275,L538183,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Trouble?
101276,L538071,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Confirmed, Captain!"
101277,L538070,u3013,m197,LT. SAAVIK,Direct hit -
101278,L538442,u3016,m197,OFFICER,"No, sir."
101279,L538441,u3021,m197,SULU,"You having hearing problems, mister?"
101280,L538440,u3016,m197,OFFICER,Sir?
101281,L538439,u3021,m197,SULU,Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
101282,L538438,u3016,m197,OFFICER,"Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir."
101283,L538437,u3021,m197,SULU,What?
101284,L538436,u3016,m197,OFFICER,"Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise."
101285,L537850,u3018,m197,SCIENCE OFFICER,What's left of it.
101286,L537849,u3021,m197,SULU,Praxis?
101287,L537848,u3018,m197,SCIENCE OFFICER,... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
101288,L537847,u3021,m197,SULU,What is it?
101289,L537846,u3018,m197,SCIENCE OFFICER,"I have confirmed the location, sir, but..."
101290,L537843,u3021,m197,SULU,"Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: ""This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"""
101291,L537842,u3018,m197,SCIENCE OFFICER,"Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -"
101292,L537841,u3021,m197,SULU,Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
101293,L537829,u3021,m197,SULU,Visual!
101294,L537828,u3018,m197,SCIENCE OFFICER,I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
101295,L537827,u3021,m197,SULU,Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
101296,L537826,u3018,m197,SCIENCE OFFICER,Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
101297,L537825,u3021,m197,SULU,According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
101298,L538497,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"Aye, aye, sir."
101299,L538496,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines."
101300,L538419,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear."
101301,L538418,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"- could take weeks, sir."
101302,L538359,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I believe I am.
101303,L538358,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock."
101304,L538357,u3020,m197,SPOCK,This one can.
101305,L538356,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
101306,L538353,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Would they?
101307,L538352,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
101308,L538351,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
101309,L538348,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,Not from us!
101310,L538347,u3020,m197,SPOCK,There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
101311,L538346,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
101312,L538235,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I know precisely where he'll be.
101313,L538234,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
101314,L538226,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts."
101315,L538225,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear..."
101316,L538220,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Then someone forged a data bank entry.
101317,L538219,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,And if they're still in place?
101318,L538218,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Nevertheless.
101319,L538217,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,That could take hours!
101320,L538216,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott."
101321,L538215,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -"
101322,L538214,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I think  not.
101323,L538213,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"A computer canna lie, sir."
101324,L538212,u3020,m197,SPOCK,Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
101325,L538211,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo."
101326,L538148,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me."
101327,L538147,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,NO WAY!
101328,L538144,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements."
101329,L538143,u3019,m197,SCOTTY,"At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -"
101330,L538775,u3020,m197,SPOCK,But you didn't join a conspiracy.
101331,L538774,u3022,m197,UHURA,"They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik."
101332,L538728,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?"
101333,L538727,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it ""Plasma"" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas."
101334,L538725,u3022,m197,UHURA,Maybe we should write them a letter?
101335,L538724,u3020,m197,SPOCK,I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
101336,L538425,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time."
101337,L538424,u3022,m197,UHURA,You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
101338,L538416,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?"
101339,L538415,u3022,m197,UHURA,I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
101340,L538364,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards..."
101341,L538363,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?"
101342,L538362,u3020,m197,SPOCK,And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
101343,L538345,u3020,m197,SPOCK,It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
101344,L538344,u3022,m197,UHURA,What exactly does that mean?
101345,L538343,u3020,m197,SPOCK,An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
101346,L538301,u3020,m197,SPOCK,He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
101347,L538300,u3022,m197,UHURA,Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
101348,L538140,u3022,m197,UHURA,"Yes, sir."
101349,L538139,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions."
101350,L538008,u3022,m197,UHURA,How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
101351,L538007,u3020,m197,SPOCK,"They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time."
101352,L540855,u3023,m198,B-9,How long is that?
101353,L540854,u3025,m198,DATA,Indefinitely.
101354,L540853,u3023,m198,B-9,For how long?
101355,L540852,u3025,m198,DATA,No. I must deactivate you.
101356,L540851,u3023,m198,B-9,No. Can I move now?
101357,L540850,u3025,m198,DATA,Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
101358,L540849,u3023,m198,B-9,No.
101359,L540848,u3025,m198,DATA,Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
101360,L540847,u3025,m198,DATA,I know.
101361,L540846,u3023,m198,B-9,I do not understand.
101362,L540845,u3025,m198,DATA,You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
101363,L540844,u3023,m198,B-9,Why?
101364,L540843,u3025,m198,DATA,Because you are dangerous.
101365,L540842,u3023,m198,B-9,Why?
101366,L540841,u3025,m198,DATA,"No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines."
101367,L540840,u3023,m198,B-9,Brother. I cannot move.
101368,L540519,u3025,m198,DATA,Is that your final answer?
101369,L540518,u3023,m198,B-9,No.
101370,L540517,u3025,m198,DATA,Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
101371,L540516,u3023,m198,B-9,No.
101372,L540515,u3025,m198,DATA,Can you remember our father?
101373,L540514,u3023,m198,B-9,I am in a room with lights.
101374,L540513,u3025,m198,DATA,Do you know where you are?
101375,L540449,u3025,m198,DATA,No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
101376,L540448,u3023,m198,B-9,You are me.
101377,L540447,u3025,m198,DATA,Do you know who I am?
101378,L540445,u3023,m198,B-9,"I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians"" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds"" took me from my homeworld. They are fat"
101379,L540444,u3025,m198,DATA,"Yes, please continue."
101380,L540443,u3023,m198,B-9,Fuzzy face is gone.
101381,L540436,u3023,m198,B-9,"I was taken from my homeworld by people called the ""PakJeds."" They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the ""Bolians."" The ""Bolians"" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship..."
101382,L540435,u3025,m198,DATA,Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
101383,L541108,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
101384,L541107,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Not tonight, I have work here."
101385,L541106,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
101386,L541105,u3031,m198,PICARD,Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
101387,L541104,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,"You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant."
101388,L540878,u3031,m198,PICARD,How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
101389,L540877,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,That was another time.
101390,L540876,u3031,m198,PICARD,"To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket."
101391,L540869,u3031,m198,PICARD,I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
101392,L540868,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
101393,L540838,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
101394,L540837,u3031,m198,PICARD,How long does he have?
101395,L540832,u3031,m198,PICARD,Dying?
101396,L540831,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,"As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying."
101397,L540830,u3031,m198,PICARD,But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
101398,L540829,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,"The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you."
101399,L540729,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Can you describe it, Deanna?"
101400,L540728,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,"Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal."
101401,L540709,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I wish I could believe that, Doctor."
101402,L540708,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,"Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else."
101403,L540705,u3031,m198,PICARD,Yes.
101404,L540704,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,Is he very much like you were?
101405,L540703,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace."
101406,L540702,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,He turned out all right.
101407,L540701,u3031,m198,PICARD,He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
101408,L540700,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,He was a bit proud as I recall.
101409,L540699,u3031,m198,PICARD,Remember him?
101410,L540698,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,You're working late.
101411,L540697,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Beverly, come in."
101412,L540694,u3031,m198,PICARD,Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
101413,L540693,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,"It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds."
101414,L540604,u3031,m198,PICARD,I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
101415,L540603,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
101416,L540602,u3031,m198,PICARD,When was he... created?
101417,L540269,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.
101418,L540268,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Please, Beverly, this is hard enough."
101419,L540267,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,"Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?"
101420,L540264,u3024,m198,BEVERLY,It'll serve you right.
101421,L540263,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!"
101422,L541055,u3025,m198,DATA,Sir.
101423,L541054,u3031,m198,PICARD,Negative.
101424,L541053,u3025,m198,DATA,"Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here."
101425,L541022,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel."
101426,L541021,u3025,m198,DATA,We are being hailed.
101427,L541006,u3031,m198,PICARD,Divert power and compensate.
101428,L541005,u3025,m198,DATA,"Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine."
101429,L540915,u3031,m198,PICARD,Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
101430,L540914,u3025,m198,DATA,We are losing dorsal shields.
101431,L540903,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!"
101432,L540902,u3025,m198,DATA,"Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications."
101433,L540901,u3031,m198,PICARD,It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
101434,L540900,u3025,m198,DATA,We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
101435,L540898,u3025,m198,DATA,"I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon."
101436,L540897,u3031,m198,PICARD,How can you be sure?
101437,L540896,u3025,m198,DATA,"No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me."
101438,L540895,u3031,m198,PICARD,"He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin"
101439,L540894,u3025,m198,DATA,"He would deny a ""human"" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman."
101440,L540893,u3031,m198,PICARD,But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
101441,L540892,u3025,m198,DATA,"I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual."
101442,L540891,u3031,m198,PICARD,Yes.
101443,L540890,u3025,m198,DATA,Of you?
101444,L540889,u3031,m198,PICARD,"""For now we see but through a glass darkly..."" He said he's a mirror."
101445,L540888,u3025,m198,DATA,At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
101446,L540887,u3031,m198,PICARD,How long until we reach the fleet?
101447,L540811,u3031,m198,PICARD,Fire!
101448,L540810,u3025,m198,DATA,"Ready, Captain."
101449,L540809,u3031,m198,PICARD,We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
101450,L540808,u3025,m198,DATA,Do you think this is a wise course of action?
101451,L540807,u3031,m198,PICARD,Well then... only one way to go.
101452,L540806,u3025,m198,DATA,"Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals."
101453,L540805,u3031,m198,PICARD,Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
101454,L540804,u3025,m198,DATA,"Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?"
101455,L540803,u3031,m198,PICARD,What do you imagine this is?
101456,L540801,u3031,m198,PICARD,"While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!"
101457,L540800,u3025,m198,DATA,They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
101458,L540799,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander."
101459,L540795,u3025,m198,DATA,There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
101460,L540794,u3031,m198,PICARD,We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
101461,L540793,u3025,m198,DATA,"Yes, sir."
101462,L540792,u3031,m198,PICARD,It'll only work for one of us.
101463,L540791,u3025,m198,DATA,Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
101464,L540790,u3025,m198,DATA,It would appear so.
101465,L540789,u3031,m198,PICARD,A weapon.
101466,L540787,u3025,m198,DATA,"Aye, sir... This way."
101467,L540786,u3031,m198,PICARD,"A bit less florid, Data."
101468,L540784,u3025,m198,DATA,He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
101469,L540783,u3031,m198,PICARD,Good work. The download?
101470,L540782,u3025,m198,DATA,"My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation."
101471,L540707,u3031,m198,PICARD,On my way.
101472,L540706,u3025,m198,DATA,"Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage."
101473,L540503,u3031,m198,PICARD,Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
101474,L540502,u3025,m198,DATA,"Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing."
101475,L540423,u3025,m198,DATA,"Sorry, sir."
101476,L540422,u3031,m198,PICARD,Data!
101477,L540414,u3031,m198,PICARD,I can see that.
101478,L540413,u3025,m198,DATA,He is very observant.
101479,L540392,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Mister Worf, accompany Data please."
101480,L540391,u3025,m198,DATA,The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
101481,L540383,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do."
101482,L540382,u3025,m198,DATA,"The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir."
101483,L540314,u3031,m198,PICARD,"New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds..."
101484,L540313,u3025,m198,DATA,To new worlds...
101485,L540312,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Now, you make a toast."
101486,L540311,u3025,m198,DATA,"If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would ""miss you."""
101487,L540310,u3031,m198,PICARD,"You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own."
101488,L540309,u3025,m198,DATA,The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
101489,L540307,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer..."
101490,L540306,u3025,m198,DATA,That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
101491,L540305,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them."
101492,L540304,u3025,m198,DATA,"And this makes you ""sad""?"
101493,L540303,u3031,m198,PICARD,Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
101494,L540302,u3025,m198,DATA,And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
101495,L540301,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time."
101496,L540300,u3025,m198,DATA,"Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously."
101497,L540299,u3025,m198,DATA,To happy endings.
101498,L540298,u3031,m198,PICARD,So... To happy endings.
101499,L540421,u3029,m198,HEAD,Why?
101500,L540420,u3025,m198,DATA,Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
101501,L540419,u3029,m198,HEAD,Why?
101502,L540418,u3025,m198,DATA,This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
101503,L540417,u3029,m198,HEAD,You have a red shirt.
101504,L540401,u3029,m198,HEAD,You do not look like me.
101505,L540400,u3025,m198,DATA,You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
101506,L540399,u3029,m198,HEAD,Why am I looking at me?
101507,L541062,u3028,m198,GEORDI,
101508,L541061,u3025,m198,DATA,What is our approximate distance?
101509,L540989,u3028,m198,GEORDI,Emergency force fields are holding.
101510,L540988,u3025,m198,DATA,"We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten."
101511,L540530,u3025,m198,DATA,I am not.
101512,L540529,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope."
101513,L540528,u3025,m198,DATA,But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
101514,L540527,u3025,m198,DATA,"No, I do not mind."
101515,L540526,u3028,m198,GEORDI,It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
101516,L540525,u3025,m198,DATA,Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
101517,L540524,u3028,m198,GEORDI,It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
101518,L540523,u3025,m198,DATA,What purpose does this serve?
101519,L540511,u3028,m198,GEORDI,Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
101520,L540510,u3025,m198,DATA,Yes.
101521,L540509,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"An individual more like you, you mean."
101522,L540508,u3025,m198,DATA,"I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual."
101523,L540507,u3028,m198,GEORDI,He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
101524,L540506,u3025,m198,DATA,"Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities."
101525,L540505,u3028,m198,GEORDI,I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
101526,L540504,u3025,m198,DATA,At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
101527,L540430,u3025,m198,DATA,"Do you have a name, sir?"
101528,L540429,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data ."
101529,L540375,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning ."
101530,L540374,u3025,m198,DATA,Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
101531,L540360,u3025,m198,DATA,"I thought only me, myself and Lore."
101532,L540359,u3028,m198,GEORDI,How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
101533,L540358,u3025,m198,DATA,"Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III."
101534,L540411,u3025,m198,DATA,Thank you.
101535,L540410,u3037,m198,WORF,If you wouldn't mind.
101536,L540403,u3025,m198,DATA,I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
101537,L540402,u3037,m198,WORF,No.
101538,L540398,u3025,m198,DATA,The resemblance is... striking.
101539,L540397,u3037,m198,WORF,It's you.
101540,L540388,u3025,m198,DATA,"Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources."
101541,L540387,u3037,m198,WORF,Why is it moving?
101542,L540386,u3025,m198,DATA,It appears to be...  ... an arm.
101543,L541049,u3031,m198,PICARD,This isn't about me anymore.
101544,L541048,u3026,m198,DEANNA,But how can he? He'll kill you.
101545,L540994,u3031,m198,PICARD,Make it so.
101546,L540993,u3026,m198,DEANNA,The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
101547,L540992,u3031,m198,PICARD,Counselor?
101548,L540991,u3026,m198,DEANNA,Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
101549,L540864,u3031,m198,PICARD,I know how he thinks.
101550,L540863,u3026,m198,DEANNA,How can you be certain?
101551,L540732,u3031,m198,PICARD,Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
101552,L540731,u3026,m198,DEANNA,Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
101553,L540612,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!"
101554,L540611,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him."
101555,L540610,u3031,m198,PICARD,How could I not?
101556,L540609,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him."
101557,L540608,u3026,m198,DEANNA,I don't know.
101558,L540607,u3031,m198,PICARD,Is he sincere about wanting peace?
101559,L540606,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow."
101560,L540471,u3026,m198,DEANNA,And I you.
101561,L540470,u3031,m198,PICARD,I'm going to miss you.
101562,L540469,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"I don't believe that, sir. Weve shared many disappointing journeys."
101563,L540468,u3031,m198,PICARD,"As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment."
101564,L540467,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations."
101565,L540466,u3031,m198,PICARD,You're speaking of emotional investment?
101566,L540465,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a ""family"" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9."
101567,L540464,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Of course, sit down."
101568,L540463,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"Do you have a moment, sir?"
101569,L540462,u3031,m198,PICARD,Counselor.
101570,L540289,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"With pleasure, Captain."
101571,L540288,u3031,m198,PICARD,May I have this dance?
101572,L540281,u3031,m198,PICARD,The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
101573,L540280,u3026,m198,DEANNA,And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
101574,L540279,u3031,m198,PICARD,"The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head."
101575,L540278,u3026,m198,DEANNA,"Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast."
101576,L540714,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I can feel your desire, Deanna."
101577,L540713,u3026,m198,DEANNA,No.
101578,L540712,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me."
101579,L540711,u3026,m198,DEANNA,You're not here.
101580,L540625,u3026,m198,DEANNA,You sick bastard!
101581,L540624,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
101582,L540622,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?"
101583,L540621,u3026,m198,DEANNA,This isn't real.
101584,L540620,u3034,m198,SHINZON,He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
101585,L540619,u3026,m198,DEANNA,No!
101586,L540618,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Imzadi. This is so good.
101587,L540570,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful."
101588,L540569,u3026,m198,DEANNA,I'm only half human.
101589,L541078,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Thank you, Commander."
101590,L541077,u3027,m198,DONATRA,This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
101591,L541076,u3031,m198,PICARD,Open a channel.
101592,L540987,u3031,m198,PICARD,Understood.
101593,L540986,u3027,m198,DONATRA,
101594,L540985,u3031,m198,PICARD,Do you have life support?
101595,L540984,u3027,m198,DONATRA,"I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain."
101596,L540965,u3031,m198,PICARD,"When this is over, I owe you a drink."
101597,L540964,u3027,m198,DONATRA,The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
101598,L540963,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Your timing is impeccable, Commander."
101599,L540962,u3027,m198,DONATRA,"Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?"
101600,L541081,u3031,m198,PICARD,Number One.  You have the bridge.
101601,L541080,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"I'll take care of it, sir."
101602,L541079,u3031,m198,PICARD,Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
101603,L541075,u3031,m198,PICARD,On screen.
101604,L541074,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Sir, we're being hailed."
101605,L541058,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Aye, sir."
101606,L541057,u3031,m198,PICARD,"You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge."
101607,L541052,u3031,m198,PICARD,"That's an order, Commander."
101608,L541051,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter..."
101609,L541050,u3031,m198,PICARD,Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
101610,L541047,u3028,m198,GEORDI,The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
101611,L541046,u3031,m198,PICARD,How long until he can fire?
101612,L541031,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Ready, sir!"
101613,L541030,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Deanna, on my mark."
101614,L541029,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Aye, sir."
101615,L541028,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me."
101616,L541019,u3031,m198,PICARD,Weve got him!
101617,L541018,u3028,m198,GEORDI,Sir?
101618,L541017,u3031,m198,PICARD,He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
101619,L541016,u3031,m198,PICARD,He wants to look me in the eye.
101620,L541015,u3028,m198,GEORDI,What's he doing?
101621,L541012,u3031,m198,PICARD,What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
101622,L541011,u3028,m198,GEORDI,He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
101623,L540858,u3031,m198,PICARD,And that's exactly what he's going to do.
101624,L540857,u3028,m198,GEORDI,It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
101625,L540692,u3031,m198,PICARD,"As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties."
101626,L540691,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain."
101627,L540690,u3031,m198,PICARD,I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
101628,L540688,u3028,m198,GEORDI,There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
101629,L540687,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready."
101630,L540686,u3028,m198,GEORDI,That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
101631,L540685,u3031,m198,PICARD,What programs were accessed?
101632,L540684,u3028,m198,GEORDI,It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
101633,L540497,u3028,m198,GEORDI,Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
101634,L540496,u3031,m198,PICARD,Cannon fodder.
101635,L540373,u3031,m198,PICARD,What do we know about the population?
101636,L540372,u3028,m198,GEORDI,"I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface."
101637,L540357,u3031,m198,PICARD,Theories?
101638,L540356,u3028,m198,GEORDI,Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
101639,L540355,u3031,m198,PICARD,What do we know about the planet?
101640,L540354,u3028,m198,GEORDI,It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
101641,L540487,u3030,m198,JANEWAY,Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
101642,L540486,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Just lucky, Admiral."
101643,L540485,u3030,m198,JANEWAY,
101644,L540484,u3031,m198,PICARD,Not with the Romulans.
101645,L540483,u3030,m198,JANEWAY,
101646,L540482,u3031,m198,PICARD,Understood.
101647,L540481,u3030,m198,JANEWAY,"Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant."
101648,L540480,u3030,m198,JANEWAY,There's more... as always. He's Reman.
101649,L540479,u3031,m198,PICARD,New Praetor?
101650,L540478,u3030,m198,JANEWAY,"A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy."
101651,L540477,u3031,m198,PICARD,With or without the rest of the fleet?
101652,L540476,u3030,m198,JANEWAY,
101653,L540475,u3031,m198,PICARD,Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
101654,L540778,u3036,m198,VICEROY,I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
101655,L540777,u3031,m198,PICARD,There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
101656,L540776,u3036,m198,VICEROY,It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
101657,L540775,u3036,m198,VICEROY,"Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly..."
101658,L540774,u3031,m198,PICARD,That will never happen.
101659,L540773,u3036,m198,VICEROY,I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
101660,L540772,u3031,m198,PICARD,What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
101661,L540771,u3036,m198,VICEROY,"So, human... you've met your better self!"
101662,L540555,u3036,m198,VICEROY,I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
101663,L540554,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to..."
101664,L540553,u3036,m198,VICEROY,Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
101665,L541118,u3037,m198,WORF,"Your new chair, sir."
101666,L541117,u3031,m198,PICARD,What's this?
101667,L541089,u3031,m198,PICARD,On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
101668,L541088,u3037,m198,WORF,"Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock."
101669,L540969,u3037,m198,WORF,"Aye, sir."
101670,L540968,u3031,m198,PICARD,Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
101671,L540922,u3031,m198,PICARD,On screen.
101672,L540921,u3037,m198,WORF,"Sir, we're being hailed."
101673,L540911,u3037,m198,WORF,"Aye, sir"
101674,L540910,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes."
101675,L540683,u3031,m198,PICARD,Who was it?
101676,L540682,u3037,m198,WORF,"Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer."
101677,L540552,u3031,m198,PICARD,On screen.
101678,L540551,u3037,m198,WORF,We're being hailed.
101679,L540548,u3037,m198,WORF,"Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields."
101680,L540547,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Tactical analysis, Mister Worf."
101681,L540546,u3037,m198,WORF,Captain!
101682,L540545,u3031,m198,PICARD,No!
101683,L540539,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Not yet, Mister Worf."
101684,L540538,u3037,m198,WORF,"Sir, I recommend we raise shields."
101685,L540394,u3031,m198,PICARD,If you don't mind.
101686,L540393,u3037,m198,WORF,"To find the head, sir?"
101687,L540352,u3031,m198,PICARD,What sort of signature?
101688,L540351,u3037,m198,WORF,I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
101689,L540350,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?"
101690,L540349,u3037,m198,WORF,Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
101691,L540348,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Wont do what, Mister Worf?"
101692,L540347,u3037,m198,WORF,I won't do it.
101693,L541101,u3031,m198,PICARD,The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
101694,L541100,u3033,m198,RIKER,Serving with you has been an honor.
101695,L541099,u3033,m198,RIKER,I intend to.
101696,L541098,u3031,m198,PICARD,When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
101697,L541097,u3033,m198,RIKER,Anything.
101698,L541096,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?"
101699,L541095,u3033,m198,RIKER,But she's not the Enterprise.
101700,L541094,u3033,m198,RIKER,She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
101701,L541093,u3031,m198,PICARD,"The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her."
101702,L540920,u3031,m198,PICARD,Agreed.
101703,L540919,u3033,m198,RIKER,Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
101704,L540918,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Counselor Troi, report to the bridge."
101705,L540907,u3033,m198,RIKER,He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
101706,L540906,u3031,m198,PICARD,Report.
101707,L540871,u3031,m198,PICARD,We can only hope so.
101708,L540870,u3033,m198,RIKER,Strength in numbers?
101709,L540862,u3031,m198,PICARD,And the Romulans invade.
101710,L540861,u3033,m198,RIKER,Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
101711,L540860,u3031,m198,PICARD,His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
101712,L540859,u3033,m198,RIKER,Sir?
101713,L540834,u3031,m198,PICARD,Can anything be done for him?
101714,L540833,u3033,m198,RIKER,"He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span."
101715,L540557,u3031,m198,PICARD,Away team. Transporter room four.
101716,L540556,u3033,m198,RIKER,Not very chatty.
101717,L540550,u3031,m198,PICARD,She's a predator.
101718,L540549,u3033,m198,RIKER,She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
101719,L540541,u3031,m198,PICARD,Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
101720,L540540,u3033,m198,RIKER,"Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are."
101721,L540536,u3031,m198,PICARD,Counselor?
101722,L540535,u3033,m198,RIKER,It's working.
101723,L540534,u3031,m198,PICARD,"It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy."
101724,L540533,u3033,m198,RIKER,Why don't they answer our hails?
101725,L540500,u3033,m198,RIKER,The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
101726,L540499,u3031,m198,PICARD,A coup d'etat?
101727,L540498,u3033,m198,RIKER,We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
101728,L540473,u3031,m198,PICARD,Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
101729,L540472,u3033,m198,RIKER,"Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command."
101730,L540380,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you."
101731,L540379,u3033,m198,RIKER,Sir --
101732,L540378,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo."
101733,L540377,u3033,m198,RIKER,"Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --"
101734,L540365,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if youll excuse me.  Ill be in the gym."
101735,L540364,u3033,m198,RIKER,"Thank you, sir..."
101736,L540363,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare."
101737,L540362,u3031,m198,PICARD,Still well on our side...
101738,L540361,u3033,m198,RIKER,Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
101739,L541025,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
101740,L541024,u3031,m198,PICARD,I am.
101741,L541023,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc."
101742,L540954,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
101743,L540953,u3031,m198,PICARD,You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
101744,L540952,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Its too late.
101745,L540951,u3031,m198,PICARD,Please.
101746,L540950,u3034,m198,SHINZON,That's your life... not mine.
101747,L540948,u3031,m198,PICARD,But you want to.
101748,L540947,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I don't know.
101749,L540946,u3031,m198,PICARD,"So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?"
101750,L540945,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Yes.
101751,L540941,u3034,m198,SHINZON,He is what his life has made him!
101752,L540940,u3031,m198,PICARD,The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
101753,L540938,u3031,m198,PICARD,I see more than what you are.
101754,L540937,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now."
101755,L540936,u3031,m198,PICARD,Not so long.
101756,L540935,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Long ago.
101757,L540934,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be."
101758,L540933,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are."
101759,L540932,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
101760,L540931,u3031,m198,PICARD,You know that's not possible.
101761,L540930,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed."
101762,L540929,u3031,m198,PICARD,And what of the Enterprise?
101763,L540928,u3034,m198,SHINZON,To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
101764,L540927,u3031,m198,PICARD,Why are you here?
101765,L540926,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me."
101766,L540925,u3031,m198,PICARD,We are.
101767,L540924,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone."
101768,L540759,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself."
101769,L540758,u3031,m198,PICARD,"I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you."
101770,L540757,u3034,m198,SHINZON,It amazes me how little you know yourself.
101771,L540756,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?"
101772,L540755,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest."
101773,L540754,u3031,m198,PICARD,If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
101774,L540753,u3034,m198,SHINZON,My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
101775,L540752,u3031,m198,PICARD,I won't defend my life to you.
101776,L540751,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be."
101777,L540750,u3031,m198,PICARD,I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
101778,L540749,u3034,m198,SHINZON,And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
101779,L540748,u3031,m198,PICARD,You're not Reman.
101780,L540747,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who..."
101781,L540746,u3031,m198,PICARD,What's this all about?
101782,L540745,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
101783,L540742,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go."
101784,L540741,u3031,m198,PICARD,All of this so you could capture me?
101785,L540739,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.
101786,L540738,u3031,m198,PICARD,What are you doing?
101787,L540736,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I was lonely...
101788,L540735,u3031,m198,PICARD,Why am I here?
101789,L540734,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Hello, Jean Luc."
101790,L540676,u3031,m198,PICARD,In time.
101791,L540675,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"In time, Jean Luc."
101792,L540674,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
101793,L540673,u3031,m198,PICARD,"If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned."
101794,L540672,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I know.
101795,L540671,u3031,m198,PICARD,Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
101796,L540670,u3034,m198,SHINZON,There is that.
101797,L540669,u3031,m198,PICARD,With a full head of hair.
101798,L540668,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I always hoped I would hit two meters.
101799,L540667,u3031,m198,PICARD,So I'm not as tall as you expected?
101800,L540666,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Age before rank, Jean Luc."
101801,L540665,u3031,m198,PICARD,"After you, Praetor."
101802,L540664,u3031,m198,PICARD,New worlds.
101803,L540663,u3034,m198,SHINZON,And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
101804,L540662,u3031,m198,PICARD,Yes.
101805,L540661,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Looking up at the stars.
101806,L540660,u3031,m198,PICARD,"No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life..."
101807,L540659,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Were we always explorers?
101808,L540658,u3031,m198,PICARD,"There's so much, and so much of it is dull..."
101809,L540657,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
101810,L540656,u3034,m198,SHINZON,All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
101811,L540655,u3031,m198,PICARD,And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
101812,L540654,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
101813,L540653,u3031,m198,PICARD,I have no reason to.
101814,L540652,u3034,m198,SHINZON,You don't trust me.
101815,L540651,u3034,m198,SHINZON,No race should be a slave to another.
101816,L540650,u3031,m198,PICARD,You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
101817,L540649,u3034,m198,SHINZON,For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
101818,L540648,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew."
101819,L540647,u3031,m198,PICARD,How did you end up on Remus?
101820,L540646,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident."
101821,L540645,u3031,m198,PICARD,Yes. The eyes have it.
101822,L540644,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes."
101823,L540643,u3031,m198,PICARD,Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
101824,L540642,u3034,m198,SHINZON,It's not quite the face you remember.
101825,L540641,u3031,m198,PICARD,You'll acquire a taste for it.
101826,L540640,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
101827,L540639,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that."
101828,L540638,u3031,m198,PICARD,What happened?
101829,L540637,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan."
101830,L540598,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I know.
101831,L540597,u3031,m198,PICARD,You know I need to verify this.
101832,L540596,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
101833,L540595,u3031,m198,PICARD,"We need to talk, just you and I."
101834,L540590,u3031,m198,PICARD,You know I do.
101835,L540589,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?"
101836,L540587,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels."
101837,L540586,u3031,m198,PICARD,Yes.
101838,L540585,u3034,m198,SHINZON,But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
101839,L540584,u3034,m198,SHINZON,And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
101840,L540583,u3031,m198,PICARD,Yes.
101841,L540582,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?"
101842,L540581,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I have dissolved the Senate.
101843,L540580,u3031,m198,PICARD,And the Senate supports you?
101844,L540579,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas."
101845,L540578,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace."
101846,L540577,u3031,m198,PICARD,I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
101847,L540576,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about."
101848,L540575,u3031,m198,PICARD,Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
101849,L540574,u3034,m198,SHINZON,On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
101850,L540573,u3031,m198,PICARD,"Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now."
101851,L540572,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?"
101852,L540568,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I've never met a human woman.
101853,L540567,u3031,m198,PICARD,Praetor?
101854,L540562,u3034,m198,SHINZON,No?
101855,L540561,u3031,m198,PICARD,And you're not as we imagined you.
101856,L540559,u3031,m198,PICARD,Praetor Shinzon?
101857,L540558,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
101858,L541044,u3032,m198,REMAN OFFICER,"But, Praetor, you won't survive without him..."
101859,L541043,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Our greater goal is more important, brother."
101860,L541042,u3032,m198,REMAN OFFICER,What about Picard?
101861,L541041,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
101862,L541040,u3032,m198,REMAN OFFICER,"Disruptors are off-line, sir."
101863,L541039,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Target disruptors. Destroy them.
101864,L540958,u3032,m198,REMAN OFFICER,"Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!"
101865,L540957,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Report!
101866,L540722,u3034,m198,SHINZON,On my way.
101867,L540721,u3032,m198,REMAN OFFICER,"Praetor, we've received the transponder signal."
101868,L541008,u3033,m198,RIKER,Let's go.
101869,L541007,u3037,m198,WORF,Intruder alert!
101870,L540960,u3037,m198,WORF,We're being hailed.
101871,L540959,u3033,m198,RIKER,"Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived."
101872,L540917,u3033,m198,RIKER,"Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online."
101873,L540916,u3037,m198,WORF,Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
101874,L540544,u3037,m198,WORF,Should I raise shields?
101875,L540543,u3033,m198,RIKER,My God...
101876,L540459,u3033,m198,RIKER,Runs in the family.
101877,L540458,u3037,m198,WORF,He's a very unusual android.
101878,L540457,u3033,m198,RIKER,So theyve got him up and running.
101879,L540456,u3037,m198,WORF,It is... invigorating.
101880,L540455,u3033,m198,RIKER,"Well, that sounds relaxing too."
101881,L540999,u3036,m198,VICEROY,She is here.
101882,L540998,u3034,m198,SHINZON,What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
101883,L540982,u3034,m198,SHINZON,FULL STOP AND FIRE !
101884,L540981,u3036,m198,VICEROY,Praetor...
101885,L540977,u3034,m198,SHINZON,You heard me.
101886,L540976,u3036,m198,VICEROY,What?!
101887,L540975,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
101888,L540885,u3036,m198,VICEROY,Seven minutes.
101889,L540884,u3034,m198,SHINZON,How long until we reach the Rift?
101890,L540882,u3036,m198,VICEROY,A matter of hours now.
101891,L540881,u3034,m198,SHINZON,How long?
101892,L540724,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
101893,L540723,u3036,m198,VICEROY,It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
101894,L540720,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Do as I tell you!
101895,L540719,u3036,m198,VICEROY,No -- this is wasting time.
101896,L540718,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Find her again.
101897,L540717,u3036,m198,VICEROY,The bond is broken.
101898,L540680,u3034,m198,SHINZON,My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
101899,L540679,u3036,m198,VICEROY,"Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out."
101900,L540678,u3034,m198,SHINZON,He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
101901,L540677,u3036,m198,VICEROY,This is a mistake.
101902,L540339,u3036,m198,VICEROY,"Yes, Praetor."
101903,L540338,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Are we prepared?
101904,L540821,u3034,m198,SHINZON,And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
101905,L540820,u3035,m198,SURAN,For the moment.
101906,L540819,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?"
101907,L540818,u3035,m198,SURAN,"And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--"
101908,L540817,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"I thought we discussed patience, Commander."
101909,L540816,u3035,m198,SURAN,
101910,L540815,u3034,m198,SHINZON,The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
101911,L540635,u3034,m198,SHINZON,Now go. I have some personal business.
101912,L540634,u3035,m198,SURAN,Praetor.
101913,L540633,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience."
101914,L540632,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Silence, Romulan!"
101915,L540631,u3035,m198,SURAN,Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
101916,L540630,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I have a purpose.
101917,L540629,u3035,m198,SURAN,And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
101918,L540628,u3034,m198,SHINZON,You don't have to understand.
101919,L540627,u3035,m198,SURAN,Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
101920,L540336,u3034,m198,SHINZON,I came this far alone ...
101921,L540335,u3035,m198,SURAN,But surely...
101922,L540334,u3034,m198,SHINZON,The Scimitar will serve my needs.
101923,L540333,u3035,m198,SURAN,"Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you."
101924,L540332,u3034,m198,SHINZON,None.
101925,L540331,u3035,m198,SURAN,How many Warbirds will you need?
101926,L540325,u3034,m198,SHINZON,It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
101927,L540324,u3035,m198,SURAN,"They will obey, Praetor."
101928,L540323,u3034,m198,SHINZON,And?
101929,L540322,u3035,m198,SURAN,They're holding position.
101930,L540321,u3034,m198,SHINZON,"Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?"
101931,L542546,u3047,m199,OFFICER,"Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look."
101932,L542545,u3038,m199,BENNY,I don't think so...
101933,L542544,u3047,m199,OFFICER,"Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?"
101934,L542533,u3047,m199,OFFICER,"No, we can handle this."
101935,L542532,u3038,m199,BENNY,Don't you think you should call a backup?
101936,L542530,u3047,m199,OFFICER,Probably kids.
101937,L542529,u3038,m199,BENNY,What did I tell you?
101938,L542526,u3047,m199,OFFICER,"Flew?! Oh, come on Benny..."
101939,L542525,u3038,m199,BENNY,There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
101940,L542524,u3047,m199,OFFICER,"Benny, there's nothing there."
101941,L542523,u3038,m199,BENNY,"It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?"
101942,L542522,u3047,m199,OFFICER,I don't see anything.
101943,L542521,u3038,m199,BENNY,Right in line with that burning tree.
101944,L542517,u3038,m199,BENNY,I don't want to scare them away.
101945,L542516,u3047,m199,OFFICER,"Benny, God, take it easy..."
101946,L543352,u3039,m199,CLERK,We should have. Let me see.
101947,L543351,u3043,m199,JENNY,Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
101948,L543094,u3039,m199,CLERK,It's still the full price.
101949,L543093,u3043,m199,JENNY,We're only going to be here a few hours...
101950,L543092,u3039,m199,CLERK,I'll have to run your card off now.
101951,L543091,u3043,m199,JENNY,Credit card.
101952,L543090,u3039,m199,CLERK,Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
101953,L543089,u3043,m199,JENNY,I'll take that.
101954,L543088,u3039,m199,CLERK,Sure.
101955,L543087,u3043,m199,JENNY,You have one with two beds?
101956,L543086,u3039,m199,CLERK,"Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two."
101957,L543085,u3043,m199,JENNY,How much are your rooms?
101958,L543084,u3039,m199,CLERK,What can I do for you folks?
101959,L542956,u3039,m199,CLERK,Have a nice trip.
101960,L542955,u3043,m199,JENNY,Thank you.
101961,L542954,u3039,m199,CLERK,Gate three. It's boarding now.
101962,L543242,u3040,m199,COOK,And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
101963,L543241,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Thank you.
101964,L543240,u3040,m199,COOK,"Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride."
101965,L543182,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,It is beautiful.
101966,L543181,u3040,m199,COOK,What do you think of America?
101967,L543180,u3040,m199,COOK,"They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything."
101968,L543179,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No.
101969,L543178,u3040,m199,COOK,Do you have children?
101970,L543173,u3040,m199,COOK,"You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it."
101971,L543172,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No.
101972,L543171,u3040,m199,COOK,Make any money?
101973,L543170,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Eh... yes.
101974,L543169,u3040,m199,COOK,"Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?"
101975,L543168,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I make maps.
101976,L543167,u3040,m199,COOK,What do you do?
101977,L543166,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I understand.
101978,L543165,u3040,m199,COOK,Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
101979,L543152,u3041,m199,DRIVER,About five miles back.
101980,L543151,u3043,m199,JENNY,Where's that?
101981,L543150,u3041,m199,DRIVER,Elmo's...
101982,L543149,u3043,m199,JENNY,What was your last stop?
101983,L543148,u3041,m199,DRIVER,Stay right there...
101984,L543147,u3043,m199,JENNY,Where did you stop last?
101985,L543146,u3041,m199,DRIVER,What the hell do you think you're doing?
101986,L543145,u3043,m199,JENNY,Where did you stop last?
101987,L543117,u3041,m199,DRIVER,He's got a gun!!
101988,L543116,u3043,m199,JENNY,No!!! No!!!
101989,L542621,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,They must have picked it up in space.
101990,L542620,u3042,m199,FOX,Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
101991,L542619,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
101992,L542618,u3042,m199,FOX,Recognize this?
101993,L542590,u3042,m199,FOX,"Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground."
101994,L542589,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?"
101995,L542588,u3042,m199,FOX,"We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?"
101996,L543433,u3042,m199,FOX,Shermin!! Shermin!!!
101997,L543432,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,I just retired.
101998,L543431,u3042,m199,FOX,What?
101999,L543430,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"George... Do you hear me, George?"
102000,L543413,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,I'm afraid we can't let you go.
102001,L543412,u3042,m199,FOX,No deal.
102002,L543347,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
102003,L543346,u3042,m199,FOX,"You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us."
102004,L543345,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Then you're going to have to do it without me.
102005,L543344,u3042,m199,FOX,"No, we don't."
102006,L543343,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,That's the chance we have to take.
102007,L543342,u3042,m199,FOX,We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
102008,L543341,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him."
102009,L543340,u3042,m199,FOX,You're not hearing me.
102010,L543339,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
102011,L543338,u3042,m199,FOX,Washington thinks it's too late for that.
102012,L543337,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
102013,L543336,u3042,m199,FOX,We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
102014,L543335,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,What's all this for?
102015,L543334,u3042,m199,FOX,Shermin...
102016,L543333,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Hello George.
102017,L543140,u3042,m199,FOX,"You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy."
102018,L543139,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it."
102019,L543138,u3042,m199,FOX,Is that what's affecting your performance?
102020,L543137,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is..."
102021,L543136,u3042,m199,FOX,So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
102022,L543135,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal."
102023,L543134,u3042,m199,FOX,I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
102024,L543133,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared."
102025,L543132,u3042,m199,FOX,We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
102026,L542889,u3042,m199,FOX,I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
102027,L542888,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay."
102028,L542887,u3042,m199,FOX,We don't know what else to do. We need results.
102029,L542886,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
102030,L542885,u3042,m199,FOX,Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
102031,L542884,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"I don't like it, George..."
102032,L542883,u3042,m199,FOX,I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
102033,L542882,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over..."
102034,L542756,u3042,m199,FOX,Oh shit!!!
102035,L542755,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
102036,L542753,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
102037,L542752,u3042,m199,FOX,Clarify that.
102038,L542751,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,It's taken on a disguise.
102039,L542750,u3042,m199,FOX,Why did you let it get into a populated area?
102040,L542747,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
102041,L542746,u3042,m199,FOX,It's in a green Mustang?
102042,L542745,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang..."
102043,L542744,u3042,m199,FOX,When can we expect containment?
102044,L542743,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial."
102045,L542629,u3042,m199,FOX,"You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck."
102046,L542628,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone."
102047,L542627,u3042,m199,FOX,"We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time."
102048,L542626,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us."
102049,L542625,u3042,m199,FOX,We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
102050,L542624,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
102051,L542623,u3042,m199,FOX,We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
102052,L542622,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Then it's not an accident that they found us.
102053,L542595,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,What do you mean by 'contain?'
102054,L542594,u3042,m199,FOX,Contain it and get back to me.
102055,L542593,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?"
102056,L542592,u3042,m199,FOX,I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
102057,L542591,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here."
102058,L542587,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Neither did I.
102059,L542586,u3042,m199,FOX,"Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin."
102060,L542585,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
102061,L542584,u3042,m199,FOX,Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
102062,L542583,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
102063,L542582,u3042,m199,FOX,There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
102064,L542581,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"It's real, George."
102065,L543428,u3042,m199,FOX,Watch it. They're coming out.
102066,L543427,u3043,m199,JENNY,I won't let anyone hurt you.
102067,L543402,u3042,m199,FOX,Okay...
102068,L543401,u3043,m199,JENNY,"If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up."
102069,L543400,u3042,m199,FOX,"You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now."
102070,L543399,u3043,m199,JENNY,I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
102071,L543398,u3042,m199,FOX,This is George Fox...
102072,L543397,u3042,m199,FOX,Mrs. Haydn...
102073,L543224,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
102074,L543223,u3043,m199,JENNY,He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
102075,L543222,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Mrs. Haydn...
102076,L543221,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
102077,L543220,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book."
102078,L543219,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Marc Shermin.
102079,L543218,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?"
102080,L543215,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Get a highway patrol unit over there.
102081,L543214,u3043,m199,JENNY,I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
102082,L543213,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
102083,L543211,u3043,m199,JENNY,No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
102084,L543210,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home."
102085,L543209,u3043,m199,JENNY,"I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home."
102086,L543208,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?"
102087,L543447,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Goodbye.
102088,L543446,u3043,m199,JENNY,I will.
102089,L543445,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Tell the baby about me.
102090,L543443,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No.
102091,L543442,u3043,m199,JENNY,"I'm never going to see you again, am I?"
102092,L543441,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I love you.
102093,L543440,u3043,m199,JENNY,You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
102094,L543439,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,What do I do now?
102095,L543438,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I must go.
102096,L543437,u3043,m199,JENNY,Well...
102097,L543417,u3043,m199,JENNY,I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
102098,L543416,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now."
102099,L543415,u3043,m199,JENNY,Where do you think you're going?
102100,L543393,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I will wave to you.
102101,L543392,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you."
102102,L543391,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,The yellow one.
102103,L543390,u3043,m199,JENNY,Where?
102104,L543389,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,There.
102105,L543386,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"No, thank you."
102106,L543385,u3043,m199,JENNY,I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
102107,L543383,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"Many, many days and nights..."
102108,L543382,u3043,m199,JENNY,How long will it take you to get home?
102109,L543381,u3043,m199,JENNY,Yes.
102110,L543380,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,You want the baby to laugh at me.
102111,L543379,u3043,m199,JENNY,Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
102112,L543378,u3043,m199,JENNY,I'd like to...
102113,L543377,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"If you want to keep it, you can."
102114,L543376,u3043,m199,JENNY,This is yours...
102115,L543375,u3043,m199,JENNY,We can.
102116,L543374,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I will say that we can be friends.
102117,L543373,u3043,m199,JENNY,What will you say about us?
102118,L543372,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions."
102119,L543371,u3043,m199,JENNY,"It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything."
102120,L543370,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I understand.
102121,L543369,u3043,m199,JENNY,Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
102122,L543368,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
102123,L543367,u3043,m199,JENNY,It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
102124,L543366,u3043,m199,JENNY,"If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass."
102125,L543365,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Yes.
102126,L543364,u3043,m199,JENNY,The cook again?
102127,L543363,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know."
102128,L543362,u3043,m199,JENNY,I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
102129,L543361,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I want to get money for you and the baby.
102130,L543360,u3043,m199,JENNY,You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
102131,L543359,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I know how to gamble now.
102132,L543358,u3043,m199,JENNY,This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
102133,L543357,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I understand.  Thank you.
102134,L543356,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore."
102135,L543355,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I want to gamble.
102136,L543354,u3043,m199,JENNY,What for?
102137,L543353,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"May I have twenty-five cents, please?"
102138,L543350,u3043,m199,JENNY,You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
102139,L543349,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
102140,L543331,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now."
102141,L543330,u3043,m199,JENNY,I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
102142,L543329,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
102143,L543328,u3043,m199,JENNY,But...
102144,L543327,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one."
102145,L543326,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Yes, they are."
102146,L543325,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,They are beautiful.
102147,L543324,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I gave you a baby last night.
102148,L543323,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Oh, you're pretty..."
102149,L543322,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I understand.
102150,L543321,u3043,m199,JENNY,"No, they don't talk... We talk to them."
102151,L543320,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Do they talk?!
102152,L543319,u3043,m199,JENNY,Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
102153,L543318,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No.
102154,L543317,u3043,m199,JENNY,"You don't forget anything, do you?"
102155,L543316,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Horses.
102156,L543315,u3043,m199,JENNY,Good morning.
102157,L543314,u3043,m199,JENNY,Nothing.
102158,L543313,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,What?
102159,L543309,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I do not get cold.
102160,L543308,u3043,m199,JENNY,You're damn right I am.
102161,L543307,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,You are cold.
102162,L543305,u3043,m199,JENNY,We'll get a ride in the morning.
102163,L543304,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go."
102164,L543303,u3043,m199,JENNY,Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
102165,L543302,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
102166,L543301,u3043,m199,JENNY,Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
102167,L543299,u3043,m199,JENNY,We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
102168,L543298,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,You can stop. I will go on alone.
102169,L543297,u3043,m199,JENNY,What are you saying?
102170,L543296,u3043,m199,JENNY,What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
102171,L543295,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,You promised.
102172,L543294,u3043,m199,JENNY,I will. I will. We still have another day.
102173,L543293,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,You promised you would get me to my ship.
102174,L543292,u3043,m199,JENNY,No one's traveling in this weather.
102175,L543291,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I can't stay on this planet.
102176,L543290,u3043,m199,JENNY,We're not going to get a ride tonight.
102177,L543289,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,The cook.
102178,L543288,u3043,m199,JENNY,Where did you learn that?
102179,L543287,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Asshole!!
102180,L543285,u3043,m199,JENNY,We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
102181,L543284,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I feel better if I move.
102182,L543283,u3043,m199,JENNY,Why can't we wait here for a ride?
102183,L543282,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I must meet my ship.
102184,L543281,u3043,m199,JENNY,Where are you going?
102185,L543275,u3043,m199,JENNY,Come on.
102186,L543274,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I don't want you to be hurt.
102187,L543273,u3043,m199,JENNY,"You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did."
102188,L543272,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I will go. But not you.
102189,L543271,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise."
102190,L543270,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me."
102191,L543269,u3043,m199,JENNY,The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
102192,L543268,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
102193,L543267,u3043,m199,JENNY,The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
102194,L543266,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
102195,L543113,u3043,m199,JENNY,No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
102196,L543112,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Are you angry at me?
102197,L543111,u3043,m199,JENNY,I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
102198,L543110,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,You can have one.
102199,L543109,u3043,m199,JENNY,No. Get in.
102200,L543108,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
102201,L543107,u3043,m199,JENNY,Hurry up.
102202,L543106,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,On the radio they say it's good.
102203,L543105,u3043,m199,JENNY,You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
102204,L543097,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
102205,L543096,u3043,m199,JENNY,Put that back.
102206,L543083,u3043,m199,JENNY,Yes. Sing some more.
102207,L543082,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,You liked my singing?
102208,L543081,u3043,m199,JENNY,That was beautiful.
102209,L543080,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I am not a good singer.
102210,L543078,u3043,m199,JENNY,Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
102211,L543077,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I do not want to.
102212,L543076,u3043,m199,JENNY,I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
102213,L543075,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Yes.
102214,L543074,u3043,m199,JENNY,Do you have music up there?
102215,L543073,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
102216,L543072,u3043,m199,JENNY,I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
102217,L543071,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I like this music.
102218,L543070,u3043,m199,JENNY,I don't know.
102219,L543069,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Why?
102220,L543068,u3043,m199,JENNY,Nobody knows.
102221,L543065,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I am your friend.
102222,L543064,u3043,m199,JENNY,Yes.
102223,L543063,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Are you my friend?
102224,L543062,u3043,m199,JENNY,What are you doing?
102225,L543061,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,He will.
102226,L543060,u3043,m199,JENNY,It's bad.
102227,L543059,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,What is hell?
102228,L543058,u3043,m199,JENNY,Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
102229,L543057,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I understand.
102230,L543056,u3043,m199,JENNY,"The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us."
102231,L543055,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
102232,L543054,u3043,m199,JENNY,A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
102233,L543053,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I don't understand 'friend.'
102234,L543052,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?"
102235,L543051,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
102236,L543050,u3043,m199,JENNY,The captain...
102237,L543049,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship..."
102238,L543048,u3043,m199,JENNY,Yes.
102239,L543047,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Yes?
102240,L543046,u3043,m199,JENNY,You did? That's funny. So did we.
102241,L543045,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars."
102242,L543044,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'"
102243,L543043,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
102244,L543042,u3043,m199,JENNY,You thought we were a different planet?!
102245,L543041,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,It was a mistake.
102246,L543040,u3043,m199,JENNY,Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
102247,L543015,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I was afraid.
102248,L543014,u3043,m199,JENNY,What happened?
102249,L543011,u3043,m199,JENNY,It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
102250,L543010,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,What?
102251,L543009,u3043,m199,JENNY,Goodbye.
102252,L543005,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Please stay.
102253,L543004,u3043,m199,JENNY,Yes?
102254,L543003,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Jennyhaydn.
102255,L543002,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Goodbye.
102256,L543001,u3043,m199,JENNY,Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
102257,L543000,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Go?
102258,L542999,u3043,m199,JENNY,Well... I'm going to go now.
102259,L542998,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Yes.
102260,L542997,u3043,m199,JENNY,Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
102261,L542995,u3043,m199,JENNY,No.
102262,L542994,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Can I have the gun?
102263,L542993,u3043,m199,JENNY,Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
102264,L542991,u3043,m199,JENNY,Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
102265,L542990,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
102266,L542989,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen..."
102267,L542988,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,The car will stop?
102268,L542987,u3043,m199,JENNY,Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
102269,L542986,u3043,m199,JENNY,"You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this..."
102270,L542985,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'"
102271,L542982,u3043,m199,JENNY,Then don't be smart.
102272,L542981,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Yes.
102273,L542980,u3043,m199,JENNY,You want this ticket?
102274,L542979,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?"
102275,L542978,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'..."
102276,L542977,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I do not speak English.
102277,L542976,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English."
102278,L542975,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,But I speak English.
102279,L542974,u3043,m199,JENNY,The driver will...
102280,L542973,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'"
102281,L542972,u3043,m199,JENNY,Say it.
102282,L542971,u3043,m199,JENNY,"That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'"
102283,L542970,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,What is hitchhike?
102284,L542969,u3043,m199,JENNY,I know that. But the buses don't go there.
102285,L542968,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,But I must go here.
102286,L542967,u3043,m199,JENNY,I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
102287,L542966,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Why?
102288,L542965,u3043,m199,JENNY,I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
102289,L542964,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Why?
102290,L542963,u3043,m199,JENNY,No... The closest...
102291,L542962,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Do you have a baby?
102292,L542961,u3043,m199,JENNY,Eh... yes...
102293,L542960,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,A baby is a new person?
102294,L542959,u3043,m199,JENNY,Yes.
102295,L542958,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,Is that a baby?
102296,L542957,u3043,m199,JENNY,The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
102297,L542930,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,When we get here.
102298,L542929,u3043,m199,JENNY,Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
102299,L542928,u3043,m199,JENNY,I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
102300,L542927,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No.
102301,L542926,u3043,m199,JENNY,Then let me go. You don't need me.

102304,L542923,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No.

102306,L542921,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I need you.
102307,L542920,u3043,m199,JENNY,That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...

102322,L542905,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,It was yellow.
102323,L542904,u3043,m199,JENNY,That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!

102444,L543263,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
102445,L543262,u3043,m199,JENNY,Sure.
102446,L543261,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,Wait. Could I have your autograph?
102447,L543260,u3043,m199,JENNY,It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
102448,L543259,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
102449,L543258,u3043,m199,JENNY,Pull over. I've got to get back there.
102450,L543257,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
102451,L543256,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,Fly.
102452,L543255,u3043,m199,JENNY,"If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?"
102453,L543254,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,"I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all."
102454,L543239,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
102455,L543238,u3043,m199,JENNY,"What? No, of course not."
102456,L543237,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,They after you?
102457,L543236,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
102458,L543235,u3043,m199,JENNY,I don't know where he is.
102459,L543234,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,"In the cars, too?!"
102460,L543233,u3043,m199,JENNY,I told you I'm looking for someone.
102461,L543232,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,"Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going."
102462,L543231,u3043,m199,JENNY,"Slow down, slow down."
102463,L543230,u3051,m199,TEENAGER,My grandmother's rich.
102464,L543229,u3043,m199,JENNY,You sure this is your car?
102465,L543249,u3044,m199,LYMAN,We're ready.
102466,L543248,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"You get that, Lyman?"
102467,L543130,u3044,m199,LYMAN,I did.
102468,L543129,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Tell him I'm not here.
102469,L543039,u3044,m199,LYMAN,Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
102470,L543038,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Doesn't make sense.
102471,L543037,u3044,m199,LYMAN,I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
102472,L542899,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
102473,L542898,u3044,m199,LYMAN,Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
102474,L542897,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature."
102475,L542612,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?"
102476,L542611,u3044,m199,LYMAN,"That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you."
102477,L542609,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Give it a rest, Lyman."
102478,L542608,u3044,m199,LYMAN,"This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns."
102479,L542602,u3044,m199,LYMAN,I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
102480,L542601,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
102481,L542580,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Get Fox.
102482,L542579,u3044,m199,LYMAN,Is it for real?
102483,L542895,u3044,m199,LYMAN,"You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?"
102484,L542894,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"You have no conception of this, do you?"
102485,L542893,u3044,m199,LYMAN,Bullshit!
102486,L542892,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool."
102487,L542891,u3044,m199,LYMAN,Save us all a lot of trouble.
102488,L542890,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
102489,L542604,u3044,m199,LYMAN,Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
102490,L542603,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
102491,L542723,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
102492,L542722,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything."
102493,L542720,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,The police think he was high on drugs...
102494,L542719,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,It was a man though... right?
102495,L542718,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
102496,L542717,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?"
102497,L542716,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
102498,L542715,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
102499,L542714,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,Yes.
102500,L542713,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,To the same woman?
102501,L542712,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,Twenty-eight years.
102502,L542711,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"You married, Major?"
102503,L542710,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"I know, but..."
102504,L542709,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,It was only an accident that we discovered them.
102505,L542708,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
102506,L542573,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,We better get it into the box. Come on...
102507,L542572,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Oh, Jesus."
102508,L542570,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be."
102509,L542569,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,People have made mistakes in these situations before.
102510,L542568,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive."
102511,L542567,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,It could have been anything.
102512,L542566,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,"No, sir. Radar."
102513,L542565,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Was there visual contact?
102514,L542564,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
102515,L542563,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,Wait'll you see it.
102516,L542562,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
102517,L542561,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,No.
102518,L542560,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Can you see under the faceplate?
102519,L542559,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
102520,L542558,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?"
102521,L542557,u3045,m199,MAJOR BELL,Very beautiful country up here...
102522,L542556,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,This has always been my favorite time of day.
102523,L543164,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,No.
102524,L543163,u3046,m199,MAN,I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
102525,L543162,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I don't understand.
102526,L543161,u3046,m199,MAN,"Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?"
102527,L543160,u3046,m199,MAN,Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
102528,L543159,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I don't understand.
102529,L543156,u3046,m199,MAN,Hop in.
102530,L543155,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English."
102531,L543154,u3046,m199,MAN,Where are you going?
102532,L542734,u3046,m199,MAN,Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
102533,L542733,u3052,m199,WOMAN,I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
102534,L542732,u3046,m199,MAN,You know that's impossible!
102535,L542731,u3052,m199,WOMAN,"Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car."
102536,L542730,u3046,m199,MAN,"Judy, that's stupid."
102537,L542729,u3052,m199,WOMAN,I told you...
102538,L543036,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
102539,L543035,u3048,m199,SECURITY GUARD,"That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know."
102540,L543034,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,I wouldn't think so.
102541,L543033,u3048,m199,SECURITY GUARD,"Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?"
102542,L543032,u3048,m199,SECURITY GUARD,Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
102543,L543031,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,You saw that?
102544,L543030,u3048,m199,SECURITY GUARD,"Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid."
102545,L543029,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that."
102546,L543028,u3048,m199,SECURITY GUARD,"Because I'm the one who called the police, you know."
102547,L543027,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't"
102548,L543026,u3048,m199,SECURITY GUARD,Is there a reward in this?
102549,L543411,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,"Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George."
102550,L543410,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"If I talk to you, I will miss my ship."
102551,L543409,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
102552,L543408,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
102553,L543407,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,We can't let you do that.
102554,L543406,u3050,m199,STAR MAN,"I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin."
102555,L543405,u3049,m199,SHERMIN,Hello...
102556,L550988,u3057,m200,LENNY,Just not the eyes.
102557,L550987,u3053,m200,BEEMER,"I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal."
102558,L550986,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?"
102559,L550985,u3053,m200,BEEMER,"Come on, let's go, I got to get back."
102560,L550984,u3057,m200,LENNY,"It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--"
102561,L550983,u3053,m200,BEEMER,Bullshit politics.
102562,L550982,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?"
102563,L550981,u3053,m200,BEEMER,"Yeah, that's right."
102564,L550726,u3057,m200,LENNY,A star is born.
102565,L550725,u3054,m200,EDUARDO,No problem.
102566,L550724,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?"
102567,L550723,u3054,m200,EDUARDO,"Yeah, right."
102568,L550722,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it ""being wired,"" but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?"
102569,L550721,u3054,m200,EDUARDO,"Hey, fuck you, man."
102570,L550720,u3057,m200,LENNY,Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
102571,L550719,u3054,m200,EDUARDO,What's all this squid shit?
102572,L550718,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors."
102573,L551312,u3055,m200,FAITH,I live for the moment.
102574,L551311,u3062,m200,TRAN,Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
102575,L551310,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party."
102576,L551065,u3062,m200,TRAN,Maybe later.
102577,L551064,u3055,m200,FAITH,Fuck you.
102578,L551063,u3062,m200,TRAN,The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
102579,L551062,u3062,m200,TRAN,I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
102580,L551061,u3055,m200,FAITH,He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
102581,L551060,u3062,m200,TRAN,"Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  ""Stand by your man"". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him."
102582,L551059,u3055,m200,FAITH,You said you were going to get her out of this.
102583,L551057,u3062,m200,TRAN,You're going down.
102584,L551056,u3055,m200,FAITH,"I made my choice, Lenny."
102585,L551051,u3062,m200,TRAN,"A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?"
102586,L551050,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?"
102587,L550939,u3062,m200,TRAN,Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
102588,L550938,u3055,m200,FAITH,You're too goddamned paranoid.
102589,L550937,u3062,m200,TRAN,"He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now."
102590,L550936,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Leave him alone, Tran."
102591,L550935,u3062,m200,TRAN,Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
102592,L550931,u3062,m200,TRAN,"Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car."
102593,L550930,u3055,m200,FAITH,"We have nothing to talk about, Lenny."
102594,L551428,u3055,m200,FAITH,'We might as well make the best of it.'
102595,L551427,u3059,m200,MAX,"And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'"
102596,L551426,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'"
102597,L551425,u3059,m200,MAX,"I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'"
102598,L551424,u3055,m200,FAITH,"I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max."
102599,L551423,u3059,m200,MAX,"You were supposed to go downstairs, baby."
102600,L551388,u3055,m200,FAITH,My God.
102601,L551387,u3059,m200,MAX,"Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true."
102602,L551385,u3059,m200,MAX,"Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass."
102603,L551384,u3055,m200,FAITH,Jesus.
102604,L551383,u3059,m200,MAX,I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
102605,L551382,u3055,m200,FAITH,You can't just... kill him.
102606,L551381,u3055,m200,FAITH,What're you going to do?
102607,L551380,u3059,m200,MAX,"Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick."
102608,L551379,u3055,m200,FAITH,Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
102609,L551378,u3059,m200,MAX,"This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead."
102610,L551300,u3055,m200,FAITH,What a nightmare.
102611,L551299,u3057,m200,LENNY,The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
102612,L551298,u3055,m200,FAITH,You think Tran killed her?
102613,L551297,u3057,m200,LENNY,Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
102614,L551296,u3055,m200,FAITH,So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
102615,L551286,u3057,m200,LENNY,No.  Mace is in this.
102616,L551285,u3055,m200,FAITH,We should talk alone.
102617,L551284,u3057,m200,LENNY,How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
102618,L551283,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this."
102619,L551282,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape."
102620,L551281,u3055,m200,FAITH,What's going on?
102621,L551048,u3057,m200,LENNY,Tell me.
102622,L551047,u3055,m200,FAITH,You don't know what you're fucking with here.
102623,L551046,u3057,m200,LENNY,I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
102624,L551045,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun."
102625,L551044,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it."
102626,L551043,u3055,m200,FAITH,Who did it?
102627,L551042,u3057,m200,LENNY,Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
102628,L551041,u3055,m200,FAITH,"You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there."
102629,L550969,u3055,m200,FAITH,"You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say ""The End."" You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes."
102630,L550968,u3057,m200,LENNY,Can't do it.
102631,L550967,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me."
102632,L550966,u3057,m200,LENNY,Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
102633,L550965,u3055,m200,FAITH,"You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around."
102634,L550964,u3057,m200,LENNY,"It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him."
102635,L550963,u3055,m200,FAITH,Damn right.
102636,L550962,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will."
102637,L550961,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers."
102638,L550960,u3055,m200,FAITH,Maybe.
102639,L550959,u3057,m200,LENNY,What?  He gonna record you on his label?
102640,L550958,u3055,m200,FAITH,He has his uses too.
102641,L550957,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys."
102642,L550956,u3055,m200,FAITH,"That's a good one, coming from you."
102643,L550955,u3057,m200,LENNY,"It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you."
102644,L550954,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself."
102645,L550953,u3057,m200,LENNY,I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
102646,L550952,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?"
102647,L550951,u3057,m200,LENNY,Tonight.
102648,L550950,u3055,m200,FAITH,You talked to Iris?  When?
102649,L550949,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble."
102650,L550948,u3055,m200,FAITH,You have to go.  I mean it.
102651,L550947,u3057,m200,LENNY,I'm already hurting.
102652,L550946,u3055,m200,FAITH,"I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you."
102653,L550945,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Hi, baby.  I've missed you."
102654,L550933,u3055,m200,FAITH,"No, Lenny."
102655,L550932,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Faith, call me, okay?"
102656,L550926,u3057,m200,LENNY,I just got to talk to you for one second.
102657,L550925,u3055,m200,FAITH,"I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny."
102658,L550920,u3057,m200,LENNY,Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
102659,L550919,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Cut it out, Tran."
102660,L550881,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Make me forget it, baby."
102661,L550880,u3057,m200,LENNY,Forget it's there.
102662,L550879,u3055,m200,FAITH,I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
102663,L550878,u3057,m200,LENNY,I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
102664,L550877,u3055,m200,FAITH,I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
102665,L550736,u3057,m200,LENNY,Watch and see.
102666,L550735,u3055,m200,FAITH,"Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?"
102667,L550773,u3057,m200,LENNY,"You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--"
102668,L550772,u3056,m200,KEITH,"Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?"
102669,L550769,u3057,m200,LENNY,Step into my office.
102670,L550768,u3056,m200,KEITH,What?  Right Here?
102671,L550767,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me."
102672,L550766,u3056,m200,KEITH,"Talk to me about costs, here."
102673,L550765,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable."
102674,L550764,u3056,m200,KEITH,Sounds good.
102675,L550761,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you."
102676,L550760,u3056,m200,KEITH,What kind of things exactly?
102677,L550759,u3057,m200,LENNY,"That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it."
102678,L550758,u3056,m200,KEITH,Clips.
102679,L550757,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software."
102680,L550756,u3056,m200,KEITH,"Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?"
102681,L550755,u3057,m200,LENNY,A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
102682,L550754,u3056,m200,KEITH,No.
102683,L550750,u3056,m200,KEITH,That's right.
102684,L550749,u3057,m200,LENNY,You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
102685,L550748,u3056,m200,KEITH,"I understand.  No, I'm not."
102686,L551421,u3059,m200,MAX,"This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says..."
102687,L551420,u3057,m200,LENNY,How did you hook up with Faith?
102688,L551419,u3059,m200,MAX,"Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second."
102689,L551418,u3057,m200,LENNY,Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
102690,L551417,u3059,m200,MAX,Naawww.
102691,L551416,u3057,m200,LENNY,So there never was a death squad.
102692,L551414,u3059,m200,MAX,You got froggy on me a couple times.
102693,L551413,u3057,m200,LENNY,"You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump."
102694,L551412,u3059,m200,MAX,"No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway."
102695,L551411,u3057,m200,LENNY,"And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend."
102696,L551410,u3059,m200,MAX,"Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times."
102697,L551409,u3059,m200,MAX,"I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control."
102698,L551408,u3057,m200,LENNY,I won't say anything.
102699,L551407,u3059,m200,MAX,Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
102700,L551405,u3059,m200,MAX,You bet.  Did you like it?
102701,L551404,u3057,m200,LENNY,Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
102702,L551403,u3059,m200,MAX,That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
102703,L551402,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?"
102704,L551401,u3059,m200,MAX,That's pretty much the way it happened.
102705,L551400,u3057,m200,LENNY,"So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me."
102706,L551399,u3059,m200,MAX,"You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one."
102707,L551398,u3057,m200,LENNY,Jesus!
102708,L551397,u3059,m200,MAX,You just did.
102709,L551396,u3057,m200,LENNY,What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
102710,L551395,u3059,m200,MAX,I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
102711,L551394,u3057,m200,LENNY,Where's Faith?
102712,L551393,u3059,m200,MAX,I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
102713,L551392,u3059,m200,MAX,Only way I could stand your ties.
102714,L551391,u3057,m200,LENNY,"No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max."
102715,L551321,u3059,m200,MAX,I intend to.
102716,L551320,u3057,m200,LENNY,2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
102717,L551319,u3059,m200,MAX,"Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?"
102718,L551318,u3057,m200,LENNY,"This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?"
102719,L551317,u3059,m200,MAX,Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
102720,L551316,u3057,m200,LENNY,What do you mean?
102721,L551315,u3059,m200,MAX,"He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade."
102722,L551269,u3059,m200,MAX,No.  Bad idea.
102723,L551268,u3057,m200,LENNY,Okay... what about Strickland?
102724,L551267,u3059,m200,MAX,"Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada."
102725,L551264,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!"
102726,L551263,u3059,m200,MAX,"Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright."
102727,L551262,u3057,m200,LENNY,Jesus.
102728,L551261,u3059,m200,MAX,"Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control."
102729,L551260,u3057,m200,LENNY,What stuff?
102730,L551259,u3059,m200,MAX,All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
102731,L551258,u3057,m200,LENNY,Whattya mean?
102732,L551252,u3057,m200,LENNY,No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
102733,L551251,u3059,m200,MAX,Is he dead?
102734,L551250,u3057,m200,LENNY,He's been cooked-off
102735,L551248,u3057,m200,LENNY,"You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!"
102736,L551247,u3059,m200,MAX,Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
102737,L551119,u3059,m200,MAX,"I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam."
102738,L551118,u3057,m200,LENNY,He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
102739,L551117,u3059,m200,MAX,"Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move."
102740,L551116,u3057,m200,LENNY,Looks like she was holding out.
102741,L551115,u3059,m200,MAX,Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
102742,L551114,u3057,m200,LENNY,Faith OK?
102743,L551112,u3057,m200,LENNY,"W'sup, Max?"
102744,L551111,u3059,m200,MAX,"Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed."
102745,L551029,u3057,m200,LENNY,Why me?
102746,L551028,u3059,m200,MAX,That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
102747,L551025,u3057,m200,LENNY,"He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all."
102748,L551024,u3059,m200,MAX,Top ten.
102749,L551023,u3057,m200,LENNY,But this is a bad one.
102750,L551022,u3059,m200,MAX,So've I.  Too much.
102751,L551021,u3057,m200,LENNY,"So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max."
102752,L551020,u3059,m200,MAX,But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
102753,L551019,u3057,m200,LENNY,He records himself raping and killing her--
102754,L551018,u3059,m200,MAX,And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
102755,L551017,u3057,m200,LENNY,He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
102756,L551016,u3059,m200,MAX,"Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?"
102757,L551015,u3057,m200,LENNY,Not now... I don't want to think about it--
102758,L551014,u3059,m200,MAX,Let's work it.
102759,L551013,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah.  No, not really."
102760,L551012,u3059,m200,MAX,You alright?  Y'okay?
102761,L550976,u3059,m200,MAX,I'm on her.
102762,L550975,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her."
102763,L550974,u3059,m200,MAX,"I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?"
102764,L550973,u3057,m200,LENNY,You should feel like shit.
102765,L550972,u3059,m200,MAX,"I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it."
102766,L550971,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy."
102767,L550826,u3057,m200,LENNY,Shutup a second!
102768,L550825,u3059,m200,MAX,"I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--"
102769,L550818,u3059,m200,MAX,"An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?"
102770,L550817,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket."
102771,L550816,u3059,m200,MAX,"See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense."
102772,L550798,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Hey, Iris, you okay?"
102773,L550797,u3059,m200,MAX,"I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes."
102774,L550796,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern."
102775,L550795,u3059,m200,MAX,"Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre."
102776,L550794,u3057,m200,LENNY,Naw.  She won't call me.
102777,L550792,u3059,m200,MAX,"Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!"
102778,L550791,u3057,m200,LENNY,"You were lucky, Max."
102779,L550789,u3057,m200,LENNY,It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
102780,L550788,u3059,m200,MAX,That's not sayin' much.
102781,L550787,u3057,m200,LENNY,This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
102782,L550786,u3059,m200,MAX,D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
102783,L550785,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Thanks, Max."
102784,L550784,u3059,m200,MAX,"Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie."
102785,L550781,u3057,m200,LENNY,Least you can do.
102786,L550780,u3059,m200,MAX,"Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink."
102787,L550779,u3057,m200,LENNY,Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
102788,L550778,u3059,m200,MAX,You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
102789,L551155,u3057,m200,LENNY,She never gave me a tape.
102790,L551154,u3061,m200,TICK,"I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'"
102791,L551153,u3057,m200,LENNY,What clip?  What was it?
102792,L551152,u3061,m200,TICK,"Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip."
102793,L551151,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!"
102794,L551150,u3061,m200,TICK,"Iris, man.  Pay attention."
102795,L551149,u3057,m200,LENNY,Who was just here?
102796,L551148,u3061,m200,TICK,"Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here."
102797,L551147,u3057,m200,LENNY,What?
102798,L551146,u3061,m200,TICK,"Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all..."
102799,L551143,u3061,m200,TICK,Well... the guy's fucked up.
102800,L551142,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer."
102801,L551141,u3061,m200,TICK,Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
102802,L550690,u3057,m200,LENNY,What else you got?
102803,L550689,u3061,m200,TICK,Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
102804,L550688,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer."
102805,L550687,u3061,m200,TICK,"Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'"
102806,L550686,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'."
102807,L550685,u3061,m200,TICK,"Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice."
102808,L550684,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me."
102809,L550683,u3061,m200,TICK,"Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'."
102810,L550682,u3061,m200,TICK,"Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it..."
102811,L550681,u3057,m200,LENNY,So lay it off to somebody else.
102812,L550680,u3061,m200,TICK,"Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it."
102813,L550679,u3057,m200,LENNY,I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
102814,L550678,u3061,m200,TICK,Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
102815,L550677,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut."
102816,L550676,u3061,m200,TICK,"I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?"
102817,L550675,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah, but how'd it get to you?"
102818,L550674,u3061,m200,TICK,With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
102819,L550673,u3057,m200,LENNY,How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
102820,L550672,u3061,m200,TICK,Sorry.
102821,L550671,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick."
102822,L550670,u3061,m200,TICK,"Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny."
102823,L551055,u3062,m200,TRAN,I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
102824,L551054,u3057,m200,LENNY,It's alright.  He means it.
102825,L551053,u3062,m200,TRAN,"Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?"
102826,L551052,u3057,m200,LENNY,Charm.
102827,L550928,u3057,m200,LENNY,"That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?"
102828,L550927,u3062,m200,TRAN,About what?
102829,L550924,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Faith, can I talk to you a second?"
102830,L550923,u3062,m200,TRAN,I always do.
102831,L550922,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out."
102832,L550921,u3062,m200,TRAN,"Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist."
102833,L550918,u3062,m200,TRAN,I already got everything I need from you.
102834,L550917,u3057,m200,LENNY,"You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls."
102835,L550916,u3062,m200,TRAN,"You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?"
102836,L550873,u3060,m200,STRICKLAND,Your existence.
102837,L550872,u3057,m200,LENNY,Your sex life?
102838,L550871,u3060,m200,STRICKLAND,"I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?"
102839,L550870,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there."
102840,L550869,u3060,m200,STRICKLAND,Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
102841,L550868,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures."
102842,L550867,u3060,m200,STRICKLAND,Commissioner Strickland.
102843,L550866,u3057,m200,LENNY,Strickland.
102844,L550865,u3060,m200,STRICKLAND,Nero.
102845,L551451,u3058,m200,MACE,Yeah.  See you there.
102846,L551450,u3057,m200,LENNY,See you downtown.
102847,L551449,u3058,m200,MACE,Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
102848,L551448,u3057,m200,LENNY,Yeah.  We did.
102849,L551447,u3058,m200,MACE,"Hey, Lenny.  We made it."
102850,L551443,u3057,m200,LENNY,Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
102851,L551442,u3058,m200,MACE,Are we under arrest?
102852,L551363,u3058,m200,MACE,"Yeah, right.  Fucked."
102853,L551362,u3057,m200,LENNY,Then we'll be right where we are now.
102854,L551361,u3058,m200,MACE,Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
102855,L551360,u3057,m200,LENNY,No.  Trust me.
102856,L551359,u3058,m200,MACE,A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
102857,L551358,u3057,m200,LENNY,Take it to him.
102858,L551354,u3057,m200,LENNY,Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
102859,L551353,u3058,m200,MACE,That's the original.  There are no copies.
102860,L551352,u3057,m200,LENNY,I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
102861,L551351,u3058,m200,MACE,And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
102862,L551350,u3057,m200,LENNY,Alright.  We're going up.
102863,L551348,u3058,m200,MACE,Uh unh.
102864,L551347,u3057,m200,LENNY,You see Tran?
102865,L551346,u3058,m200,MACE,No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
102866,L551345,u3057,m200,LENNY,Got your ticket?
102867,L551344,u3058,m200,MACE,"Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on."
102868,L551343,u3057,m200,LENNY,Mace... you're a girl.
102869,L551340,u3058,m200,MACE,"No, it's not."
102870,L551339,u3057,m200,LENNY,"But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left."
102871,L551338,u3058,m200,MACE,You never told me.
102872,L551337,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul."
102873,L551336,u3058,m200,MACE,No.  It didn't.
102874,L551335,u3057,m200,LENNY,And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
102875,L551334,u3058,m200,MACE,I guess.
102876,L551333,u3057,m200,LENNY,"It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them..."
102877,L551332,u3058,m200,MACE,Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
102878,L551325,u3058,m200,MACE,"Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that."
102879,L551324,u3057,m200,LENNY,Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
102880,L551323,u3058,m200,MACE,I'm not going.
102881,L551322,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--"
102882,L551294,u3058,m200,MACE,Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
102883,L551293,u3057,m200,LENNY,Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
102884,L551271,u3057,m200,LENNY,Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
102885,L551270,u3058,m200,MACE,Who's Strickland?
102886,L551266,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah, right, blow it open."
102887,L551265,u3058,m200,MACE,"The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow..."
102888,L551254,u3058,m200,MACE,How long does it last?  Oh.
102889,L551253,u3057,m200,LENNY,He's totally cut off from the outer world.
102890,L551246,u3057,m200,LENNY,"To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am."
102891,L551245,u3058,m200,MACE,Why?
102892,L551244,u3057,m200,LENNY,I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
102893,L551243,u3058,m200,MACE,I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
102894,L551242,u3057,m200,LENNY,It was a tough call.
102895,L551241,u3058,m200,MACE,Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
102896,L551240,u3057,m200,LENNY,There's a plus side?
102897,L551239,u3058,m200,MACE,"Well, look at the plus side."
102898,L551238,u3057,m200,LENNY,"So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny."
102899,L551232,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'."
102900,L551231,u3058,m200,MACE,People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
102901,L551230,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I've got a good idea, yeah."
102902,L551229,u3058,m200,MACE,You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
102903,L551228,u3057,m200,LENNY,We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
102904,L551226,u3057,m200,LENNY,Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
102905,L551225,u3058,m200,MACE,I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
102906,L551224,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?"
102907,L551203,u3057,m200,LENNY,Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
102908,L551202,u3058,m200,MACE,Uh unh.  I won't do it.
102909,L551201,u3057,m200,LENNY,I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
102910,L551200,u3058,m200,MACE,Tell me.
102911,L551192,u3057,m200,LENNY,"It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving."
102912,L551191,u3058,m200,MACE,You sure?
102913,L551190,u3057,m200,LENNY,Those two guys were cops.
102914,L551186,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it."
102915,L551185,u3058,m200,MACE,I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
102916,L551180,u3058,m200,MACE,"Fire's out, isn't it?"
102917,L551179,u3057,m200,LENNY,Are you out of your fucking mind?!
102918,L551178,u3057,m200,LENNY,The gas tank's going to go any second!
102919,L551177,u3058,m200,MACE,This is bad.
102920,L551176,u3058,m200,MACE,"It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway."
102921,L551175,u3057,m200,LENNY,Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
102922,L551174,u3058,m200,MACE,Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
102923,L551173,u3057,m200,LENNY,Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
102924,L551172,u3058,m200,MACE,Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
102925,L551171,u3057,m200,LENNY,Shit!
102926,L551166,u3057,m200,LENNY,It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
102927,L551165,u3058,m200,MACE,"Lenny, give them the tape."
102928,L551158,u3058,m200,MACE,Something in your car...
102929,L551157,u3057,m200,LENNY,"She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car..."
102930,L551156,u3058,m200,MACE,Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
102931,L551135,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful."
102932,L551134,u3058,m200,MACE,"Lenny, have you lost it completely?"
102933,L551131,u3057,m200,LENNY,No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
102934,L551130,u3058,m200,MACE,You better keep a low profile for a while.
102935,L551129,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!"
102936,L551128,u3058,m200,MACE,Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
102937,L551126,u3057,m200,LENNY,This tie doesn't go with blue!
102938,L551125,u3058,m200,MACE,What is it?
102939,L551123,u3057,m200,LENNY,Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
102940,L551122,u3058,m200,MACE,Where we going?
102941,L551121,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Jesus, Mace!"
102942,L551120,u3058,m200,MACE,Whatup Lenny?
102943,L551103,u3057,m200,LENNY,S'okay.  I know you still love me.
102944,L551102,u3058,m200,MACE,"I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry."
102945,L551101,u3058,m200,MACE,OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
102946,L551100,u3057,m200,LENNY,How's Zander?
102947,L551099,u3058,m200,MACE,Sure.
102948,L551098,u3057,m200,LENNY,"The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?"
102949,L551097,u3058,m200,MACE,Now you're really getting paranoid.
102950,L551096,u3057,m200,LENNY,And what about the guy that was following me?
102951,L551095,u3058,m200,MACE,That's where it gets a little strange.
102952,L551094,u3057,m200,LENNY,Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
102953,L551093,u3058,m200,MACE,"Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?"
102954,L551092,u3057,m200,LENNY,"If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko."
102955,L551091,u3058,m200,MACE,So the guy's not a sicko.
102956,L551090,u3057,m200,LENNY,"She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason."
102957,L551089,u3058,m200,MACE,Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
102958,L551088,u3057,m200,LENNY,No it doesn't.
102959,L551087,u3058,m200,MACE,"But that doesn't add, does it."
102960,L551086,u3057,m200,LENNY,"See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve."
102961,L551083,u3058,m200,MACE,It's not your fault.
102962,L551082,u3057,m200,LENNY,"She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night."
102963,L551081,u3057,m200,LENNY,Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
102964,L551080,u3058,m200,MACE,"No more, Lenny."
102965,L551079,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong..."
102966,L551078,u3058,m200,MACE,Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
102967,L551077,u3057,m200,LENNY,It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
102968,L551076,u3058,m200,MACE,So that gives you something.
102969,L551075,u3057,m200,LENNY,He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
102970,L551073,u3057,m200,LENNY,Never really thought about it.
102971,L551072,u3058,m200,MACE,You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
102972,L551071,u3057,m200,LENNY,Is this great fabric or what?
102973,L551039,u3058,m200,MACE,So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
102974,L551038,u3057,m200,LENNY,Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
102975,L551035,u3058,m200,MACE,"This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts."
102976,L551034,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Jesus, Mace.  Back off."
102977,L551031,u3057,m200,LENNY,I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
102978,L551030,u3058,m200,MACE,"Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach."
102979,L551027,u3057,m200,LENNY,Wants to share.
102980,L551026,u3058,m200,MACE,And gives it to you.
102981,L551008,u3058,m200,MACE,Are you sure it's real?
102982,L551007,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her."
102983,L551006,u3058,m200,MACE,Blackjack?  I don't understand--
102984,L551005,u3057,m200,LENNY,Black.  Jack.
102985,L551004,u3058,m200,MACE,"My God, Lenny.  What is it?"
102986,L551000,u3057,m200,LENNY,Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
102987,L550999,u3058,m200,MACE,What is it?
102988,L550995,u3057,m200,LENNY,No idea.
102989,L550994,u3058,m200,MACE,What's that?  Present from Faith?
102990,L550993,u3057,m200,LENNY,"It is my sword and my shield, Macey."
102991,L550992,u3058,m200,MACE,What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
102992,L550991,u3057,m200,LENNY,I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
102993,L550990,u3058,m200,MACE,"You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all."
102994,L550915,u3057,m200,LENNY,You'll see.
102995,L550914,u3058,m200,MACE,Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
102996,L550913,u3057,m200,LENNY,She's my destiny.
102997,L550912,u3058,m200,MACE,She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
102998,L550911,u3057,m200,LENNY,She still loves me.
102999,L550910,u3058,m200,MACE,Forget her.
103000,L550909,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Rams... that's football, right?"
103001,L550908,u3058,m200,MACE,Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
103002,L550907,u3057,m200,LENNY,Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
103003,L550905,u3058,m200,MACE,"Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love."
103004,L550904,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her."
103005,L550903,u3058,m200,MACE,"Jesus, Lenny."
103006,L550902,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way."
103007,L550901,u3058,m200,MACE,Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
103008,L550900,u3057,m200,LENNY,"You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?"
103009,L550899,u3058,m200,MACE,"Look, I gotta get some sleep."
103010,L550898,u3057,m200,LENNY,"I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really."
103011,L550897,u3058,m200,MACE,"Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer."
103012,L550896,u3057,m200,LENNY,Macey... I've never seen you like this.
103013,L550895,u3058,m200,MACE,"No, you're just trying to get off."
103014,L550894,u3057,m200,LENNY,So am I.  Just trying to get by.
103015,L550893,u3058,m200,MACE,"No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here."
103016,L550892,u3057,m200,LENNY,I thought we were friends.
103017,L550891,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?"
103018,L550890,u3058,m200,MACE,"I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else."
103019,L550889,u3057,m200,LENNY,That would be no.
103020,L550887,u3058,m200,MACE,Get it.
103021,L550886,u3057,m200,LENNY,I need my case.  It's still in the back.
103022,L550884,u3057,m200,LENNY,In LA?  Are you crazy?
103023,L550883,u3058,m200,MACE,"I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny."
103024,L550882,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?"
103025,L550876,u3057,m200,LENNY,Let's talk in the car.
103026,L550875,u3058,m200,MACE,Are we having a bad night?
103027,L550864,u3058,m200,MACE,You will not live to see the morning.
103028,L550863,u3057,m200,LENNY,Coming with you.
103029,L550862,u3058,m200,MACE,What the fuck are you doing?
103030,L550860,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind."
103031,L550859,u3058,m200,MACE,Fumitsu.
103032,L550858,u3057,m200,LENNY,What's his name?
103033,L550856,u3058,m200,MACE,Define love.
103034,L550855,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Yeah, but that was for love."
103035,L550854,u3058,m200,MACE,Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
103036,L550853,u3057,m200,LENNY,Define illegal.
103037,L550852,u3058,m200,MACE,"Lenny, this shit's illegal."
103038,L550851,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks."
103039,L550850,u3058,m200,MACE,Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
103040,L550849,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--"
103041,L550848,u3058,m200,MACE,"Uh huh, I wanna hear this part."
103042,L550847,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives."
103043,L550846,u3058,m200,MACE,Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
103044,L550845,u3057,m200,LENNY,"No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it."
103045,L550844,u3058,m200,MACE,"So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?"
103046,L550843,u3058,m200,MACE,Driving Mr. Lenny.
103047,L550842,u3057,m200,LENNY,Mace!  You're a life-saver.
103048,L550841,u3058,m200,MACE,"Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab."
103049,L550840,u3058,m200,MACE,"Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends."
103050,L550839,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight."
103051,L550838,u3058,m200,MACE,Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
103052,L550837,u3057,m200,LENNY,Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
103053,L550836,u3058,m200,MACE,Sleaze to peddle.
103054,L550835,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell."
103055,L550834,u3058,m200,MACE,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today."
103056,L550833,u3057,m200,LENNY,"Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--"
103057,L550820,u3057,m200,LENNY,"They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?"
103058,L550819,u3058,m200,MACE,"Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story."
103059,L551195,u3063,m200,ZANDER,"Aw, Mom!"
103060,L551194,u3058,m200,MACE,"We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop."
103061,L551110,u3058,m200,MACE,Well give me some then... I'm starving.
103062,L551109,u3063,m200,ZANDER,Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
103063,L551108,u3058,m200,MACE,What is that?
103064,L551107,u3058,m200,MACE,Are you going to make me beg?
103065,L551106,u3063,m200,ZANDER,Right.  That explains it.
103066,L551105,u3058,m200,MACE,Just Lenny.
103067,L551104,u3063,m200,ZANDER,Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
103068,L551276,u3059,m200,MAX,You really want that on your head?
103069,L551275,u3058,m200,MACE,"Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!"
103070,L551274,u3059,m200,MAX,Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
103071,L551273,u3058,m200,MACE,So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
103072,L551257,u3059,m200,MAX,There's more to this whole thing than you think.
103073,L551256,u3058,m200,MACE,This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
103074,L551255,u3059,m200,MAX,Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
103075,L551037,u3058,m200,MACE,Take the tape to the cops.
103076,L551036,u3059,m200,MAX,"Problem is, Lenny knows everybody."
103077,L551033,u3058,m200,MACE,"Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?"
103078,L551032,u3059,m200,MAX,"He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something."
103079,L550830,u3059,m200,MAX,Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
103080,L550829,u3058,m200,MACE,But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
103081,L550828,u3059,m200,MAX,"Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy."
103082,L550827,u3058,m200,MACE,"Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?"
103083,L550822,u3059,m200,MAX,"Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up."
103084,L550821,u3058,m200,MACE,"No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?"
103085,L562603,u3064,m201,CANDY,"The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet."
103086,L562602,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Testa?
103087,L562601,u3064,m201,CANDY,"To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name."
103088,L562600,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Besides that.
103089,L562599,u3064,m201,CANDY,Um... he was older.
103090,L562598,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Was this him?
103091,L562506,u3065,m201,DAITZ,Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
103092,L562505,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
103093,L562502,u3065,m201,DAITZ,"You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was ""out to get him."" The decision was made to relieve him."
103094,L562501,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
103095,L562500,u3065,m201,DAITZ,"...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low."
103096,L562499,u3065,m201,DAITZ,"Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low..."
103097,L562498,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,No.
103098,L562497,u3065,m201,DAITZ,"Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter ""Z,"" turned it on it's side, got ""N"" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?"
103099,L562496,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Have you had a chance to think about --
103100,L562262,u3077,m201,SALINAS,The diner?
103101,L562261,u3066,m201,DUNCAN,"No, sir."
103102,L562260,u3077,m201,SALINAS,Anybody talk to the press?
103103,L562259,u3066,m201,DUNCAN,Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
103104,L562258,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?"
103105,L562221,u3066,m201,DUNCAN,"I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority."
103106,L562220,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there."
103107,L562200,u3066,m201,DUNCAN,Yeah.
103108,L562199,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?"
103109,L562198,u3066,m201,DUNCAN,"Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?"
103110,L562812,u3067,m201,DYLAN,Winona.
103111,L562811,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?"
103112,L562810,u3067,m201,DYLAN,She's buried.
103113,L562809,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You have the body?
103114,L562808,u3067,m201,DYLAN,Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
103115,L562807,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What?
103116,L562806,u3067,m201,DYLAN,You heard?
103117,L562805,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
103118,L562804,u3067,m201,DYLAN,Hi there.
103119,L562803,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?"
103120,L562802,u3067,m201,DYLAN,Dylan here.
103121,L562389,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her."
103122,L562388,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong."
103123,L562387,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Show's over, boys. Nobody home."
103124,L562385,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?"
103125,L562384,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,The room key's in the car. On the seat.
103126,L562382,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Let's take a look.
103127,L562381,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response."
103128,L562380,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What does the Manager say?
103129,L562379,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?"
103130,L562378,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Hey, Sheriff."
103131,L562377,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I'm on my way.
103132,L562376,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?"
103133,L562375,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You tell me.
103134,L562374,u3067,m201,DYLAN,What's the bad news?
103135,L562373,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news."
103136,L562372,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan."
103137,L562371,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Agent Mackelway.
103138,L562296,u3067,m201,DYLAN,I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
103139,L562295,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,This isn't in our database?
103140,L562294,u3067,m201,DYLAN,Who knows.
103141,L562293,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You're thinking...?
103142,L562292,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished."
103143,L562291,u3067,m201,DYLAN,I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
103144,L562290,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
103145,L562289,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?"
103146,L562280,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"That's right, Jan."
103147,L562279,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor."
103148,L562243,u3067,m201,DYLAN,Ten miles back on the Texas side.
103149,L562242,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
103150,L562230,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo."
103151,L562229,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?"
103152,L562228,u3067,m201,DYLAN,"Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell."
103153,L562227,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You run the plates?
103154,L562844,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns."
103155,L562843,u3068,m201,EAGLEFOOT,A grill pattern.
103156,L562842,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks."
103157,L562841,u3068,m201,EAGLEFOOT,The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
103158,L562840,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I'm sorry. This won't take long.
103159,L562839,u3068,m201,EAGLEFOOT,"The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse."
103160,L562313,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after."
103161,L562312,u3068,m201,EAGLEFOOT,"Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat."
103162,L562306,u3077,m201,SALINAS,This is Agent Mackelway.
103163,L562305,u3068,m201,EAGLEFOOT,"Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back."
103164,L562300,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?"
103165,L562299,u3068,m201,EAGLEFOOT,We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
103166,L562298,u3077,m201,SALINAS,I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
103167,L562297,u3068,m201,EAGLEFOOT,"Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off."
103168,L562880,u3078,m201,ZERO,Not as much as you'd think.
103169,L562879,u3069,m201,FOREMAN,"Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot."
103170,L562878,u3078,m201,ZERO,It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
103171,L562877,u3069,m201,FOREMAN,You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
103172,L562876,u3078,m201,ZERO,"Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity."
103173,L562875,u3069,m201,FOREMAN,I have 6 tons.
103174,L562874,u3078,m201,ZERO,"Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6."
103175,L562873,u3069,m201,FOREMAN,There seems to be a discrepancy.
103176,L562196,u3070,m201,HAROLD,Why me? What do you want from me!?
103177,L562195,u3074,m201,LOW,I've been looking for you.
103178,L562192,u3070,m201,HAROLD,What do you want from me?
103179,L562191,u3074,m201,LOW,You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
103180,L562190,u3070,m201,HAROLD,"Oh God, mister, please leave me alone."
103181,L562189,u3074,m201,LOW,"Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there."
103182,L562186,u3074,m201,LOW,What's wrong with me?
103183,L562185,u3070,m201,HAROLD,You're a... you're sick.
103184,L562184,u3074,m201,LOW,"Not bad, huh?"
103185,L562183,u3070,m201,HAROLD,My God.
103186,L562181,u3074,m201,LOW,"Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?"
103187,L562180,u3070,m201,HAROLD,"Look, mister..."
103188,L562179,u3074,m201,LOW,"Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?"
103189,L562178,u3070,m201,HAROLD,What are you...?
103190,L562177,u3074,m201,LOW,"You know, you ever think about other women?"
103191,L562176,u3070,m201,HAROLD,Excuse me?
103192,L562175,u3074,m201,LOW,"You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know..."
103193,L562174,u3070,m201,HAROLD,Look...
103194,L562173,u3074,m201,LOW,About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
103195,L562172,u3070,m201,HAROLD,What?
103196,L562171,u3074,m201,LOW,Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
103197,L562170,u3070,m201,HAROLD,"I don't mean to be rude, but..."
103198,L562169,u3074,m201,LOW,Whole country or just hereabouts?
103199,L562168,u3070,m201,HAROLD,Yeah.
103200,L562167,u3074,m201,LOW,"You must travel a lot, huh?"
103201,L562166,u3070,m201,HAROLD,Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
103202,L562165,u3074,m201,LOW,Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
103203,L562164,u3070,m201,HAROLD,You... surprised me.
103204,L562163,u3074,m201,LOW,Hi. What's in the case?
103205,L562162,u3070,m201,HAROLD,Jesus.
103206,L562286,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Put a BOLO out on that.
103207,L562285,u3071,m201,JANITA,"An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford."
103208,L562284,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What kind?
103209,L562283,u3071,m201,JANITA,There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
103210,L562282,u3071,m201,JANITA,It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
103211,L562281,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,He was sitting here?
103212,L562278,u3071,m201,JANITA,He had an orange hat on.
103213,L562277,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,How did you know he was a construction worker?
103214,L562276,u3071,m201,JANITA,"I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember."
103215,L562275,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What did he look like?
103216,L562274,u3071,m201,JANITA,Yes.
103217,L562273,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?"
103218,L562416,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?"
103219,L562415,u3077,m201,SALINAS,Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
103220,L562414,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about ""Zorro Killer"" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?"
103221,L562413,u3077,m201,SALINAS,Maybe something to do with Zorro.
103222,L562412,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,He said it was a clue?
103223,L562316,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
103224,L562315,u3077,m201,SALINAS,At the field office.
103225,L562314,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,You have the photo from the diner?
103226,L562311,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,What's with the eyelids?
103227,L562310,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence."
103228,L562309,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,What about his killer?
103229,L562308,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count."
103230,L562950,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them."
103231,L562949,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you."
103232,L562948,u3073,m201,KULOK,Please.
103233,L562947,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,What are you doing?
103234,L562946,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Deputy Director, get out, sir."
103235,L562596,u3073,m201,KULOK,Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
103236,L562595,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Another what?
103237,L562594,u3073,m201,KULOK,We have another one.
103238,L562593,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,What?
103239,L562592,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know."
103240,L562345,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Smarter than us.
103241,L562344,u3073,m201,KULOK,Maybe cause he's smart.
103242,L562343,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?"
103243,L562304,u3073,m201,KULOK,Just an observer.
103244,L562303,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics."
103245,L562904,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
103246,L562903,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Dick Low's a killer too.
103247,L562902,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
103248,L562901,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target."
103249,L562900,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?"
103250,L562899,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him."
103251,L562898,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
103252,L562897,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
103253,L562896,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
103254,L562895,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,He's got you believing in Zero now too.
103255,L562747,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him."
103256,L562746,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I understand.
103257,L562745,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed."
103258,L562744,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir."
103259,L562743,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,There was talk of a file photo.
103260,L562742,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I didn't use Low's name.
103261,L562741,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
103262,L562740,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I was looking for a pattern.
103263,L562739,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames."
103264,L562738,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket."
103265,L562737,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,You didn't tell anyone where you were?
103266,L562736,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I was visiting an old college friend.
103267,L562735,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Why did you go to Chicago?
103268,L562625,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way."
103269,L562624,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Huh?, sir."
103270,L562623,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
103271,L562622,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
103272,L562621,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
103273,L562618,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Collected shoes too?
103274,L562617,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was ""Imelda."" Have to give him that, had a sense of humor."
103275,L562591,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him."
103276,L562590,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
103277,L562589,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here."
103278,L562588,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"You knew the arm slash was not ""Zorro."""
103279,L562587,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close."
103280,L562586,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,How long ago?
103281,L562585,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file."
103282,L562584,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso."
103283,L562583,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero."
103284,L562582,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"""Was?"""
103285,L562581,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met."
103286,L562580,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
103287,L562579,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"""Murman"" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original ""Catch Me Before I Kill Again"" killer. Short for ""Murder Man."" It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field."
103288,L562558,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
103289,L562557,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I'm hesitant to...
103290,L562556,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,I don't believe this.
103291,L562555,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing."
103292,L562547,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?"
103293,L562546,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Had trouble sleeping last night, sir."
103294,L562545,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?"
103295,L562428,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
103296,L562427,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?"
103297,L562426,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What I do requires confidentiality.
103298,L562425,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,I'll take it into consideration.
103299,L562424,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?"
103300,L562423,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
103301,L562422,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently."
103302,L562421,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms."
103303,L562410,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Go ahead.
103304,L562409,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
103305,L562405,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?"
103306,L562404,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Do you think he singled you out?
103307,L562403,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,He got away. I had him. He got away.
103308,L562402,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
103309,L562401,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him."
103310,L562400,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"How do you feel, Agent"
103311,L562369,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Then why do I still have a badge?
103312,L562368,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Its called insubordination.
103313,L562367,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again."
103314,L562366,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,You refused to comply with a direct order.
103315,L562365,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way."
103316,L562364,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
103317,L562363,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
103318,L562362,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned."
103319,L562361,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
103320,L562360,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,I'll relay this to CIIAC.
103321,L562353,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,MyDick.
103322,L562352,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,From the grave?
103323,L562351,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Speck. Harold Speck.
103324,L562350,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Who?
103325,L562349,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I think I talked to him.
103326,L562347,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,This better be important.
103327,L562346,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington."
103328,L562945,u3074,m201,LOW,"You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person."
103329,L562944,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
103330,L562943,u3074,m201,LOW,"Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it."
103331,L562942,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass."
103332,L562941,u3074,m201,LOW,"When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --"
103333,L562937,u3074,m201,LOW,"Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --"
103334,L562936,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,You are so fucked up.
103335,L562935,u3074,m201,LOW,"How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report."
103336,L562934,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me."
103337,L562933,u3074,m201,LOW,"You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose."
103338,L562932,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,Don't you touch him.
103339,L562926,u3072,m201,KOESSLER,"Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked."
103340,L562925,u3074,m201,LOW,"Miss me, Dave?"
103341,L562907,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I'm going to Amarillo.
103342,L562906,u3073,m201,KULOK,What happened?
103343,L562872,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information."
103344,L562871,u3073,m201,KULOK,How are we going to find him?
103345,L562870,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country."
103346,L562869,u3073,m201,KULOK,It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
103347,L562868,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Jaime --
103348,L562867,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I've got to take a piss.
103349,L562866,u3073,m201,KULOK,I...
103350,L562865,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
103351,L562863,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"But it was your idea: ""use Zero,"" you said, use Zero to get Low."
103352,L562862,u3073,m201,KULOK,"You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going."
103353,L562861,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
103354,L562860,u3073,m201,KULOK,Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
103355,L562859,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Low calls him Suspect Zero.
103356,L562858,u3073,m201,KULOK,All the same killer?
103357,L562857,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as ""burn residue."" Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection."
103358,L562856,u3073,m201,KULOK,It's quite advanced.
103359,L562853,u3073,m201,KULOK,What's going on?
103360,L562852,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Yeah, of course."
103361,L562851,u3073,m201,KULOK,You okay?
103362,L562850,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
103363,L562849,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Tom, you okay?"
103364,L562848,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer."
103365,L562847,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,But why this pattern?
103366,L562832,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now."
103367,L562831,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?"
103368,L562830,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it."
103369,L562829,u3073,m201,KULOK,You're putting me in a difficult position.
103370,L562828,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead."
103371,L562827,u3073,m201,KULOK,"It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong."
103372,L562826,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us."
103373,L562825,u3073,m201,KULOK,I'd be real careful if I were you.
103374,L562824,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low."
103375,L562823,u3073,m201,KULOK,Koessler doesn't know any of this?
103376,L562822,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret."
103377,L562821,u3073,m201,KULOK,Does one exist?
103378,L562820,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
103379,L562819,u3073,m201,KULOK,And you're working with him?
103380,L562818,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You were right. He found me.
103381,L562817,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Slow down a second, you met with Low --"
103382,L562816,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on."
103383,L562815,u3073,m201,KULOK,What's going on?
103384,L562814,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I guess I'm a little paranoid.
103385,L562813,u3073,m201,KULOK,This feels like something out of a spy novel.
103386,L562714,u3073,m201,KULOK,"But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low."
103387,L562713,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
103388,L562712,u3073,m201,KULOK,Suspect Zero.
103389,L562711,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Start killing people for real?
103390,L562710,u3073,m201,KULOK,You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
103391,L562709,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
103392,L562696,u3073,m201,KULOK,I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
103393,L562695,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What's up?
103394,L562694,u3073,m201,KULOK,Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
103395,L562693,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Jaime? Where are you?
103396,L562692,u3073,m201,KULOK,Hello?
103397,L562657,u3073,m201,KULOK,I just need to go a little slow.
103398,L562656,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
103399,L562655,u3073,m201,KULOK,"That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around."
103400,L562654,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Not the way I can.
103401,L562653,u3073,m201,KULOK,And nobody else can do that?
103402,L562652,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
103403,L562651,u3073,m201,KULOK,"You need time to think. About the case, about you and me."
103404,L562650,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What's that?
103405,L562649,u3073,m201,KULOK,Then there's the other issue.
103406,L562648,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,That's true.
103407,L562647,u3073,m201,KULOK,There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
103408,L562646,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Oh.
103409,L562645,u3073,m201,KULOK,"No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me."
103410,L562644,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence."
103411,L562643,u3073,m201,KULOK,Maybe we should back off a bit.
103412,L562642,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You did.
103413,L562641,u3073,m201,KULOK,I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
103414,L562640,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that."
103415,L562639,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that."
103416,L562620,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman."
103417,L562619,u3073,m201,KULOK,You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
103418,L562615,u3073,m201,KULOK,Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
103419,L562614,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
103420,L562613,u3073,m201,KULOK,"You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs."
103421,L562612,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You mean --
103422,L562611,u3073,m201,KULOK,Sue Ann Hanson.
103423,L562610,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,The tattoo?
103424,L562609,u3073,m201,KULOK,"We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --"
103425,L562608,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Jesus.
103426,L562607,u3073,m201,KULOK,"We did find these, however."
103427,L562606,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
103428,L562605,u3073,m201,KULOK,"No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van."
103429,L562604,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Find the feet?
103430,L562528,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Not yet. Not about this, either."
103431,L562527,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Not about coming to see Daitz?
103432,L562526,u3073,m201,KULOK,Just routine stuff.
103433,L562525,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What did you tell him?
103434,L562524,u3073,m201,KULOK,He's called a couple times.
103435,L562523,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Does Koessler ask about me?
103436,L562522,u3073,m201,KULOK,I've been thinking about this.
103437,L562521,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I know.
103438,L562520,u3073,m201,KULOK,It's a no-no.
103439,L562519,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"""Intra-Agency fraternizing."""
103440,L562518,u3073,m201,KULOK,There are Agency regulations about this.
103441,L562517,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Oh yeah, I forgot."
103442,L562516,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Because you asked him to, stupid."
103443,L562515,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
103444,L562514,u3073,m201,KULOK,"No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd."
103445,L562513,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd."
103446,L562512,u3073,m201,KULOK,Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
103447,L562511,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
103448,L562510,u3073,m201,KULOK,Huh?
103449,L562509,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?"
103450,L562508,u3073,m201,KULOK,Don't be too harsh.
103451,L562507,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me."
103452,L562473,u3073,m201,KULOK,He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
103453,L562472,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
103454,L562471,u3073,m201,KULOK,"I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better."
103455,L562470,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature."
103456,L562469,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Me too.  Make any headway with ""Zorro""?"
103457,L562468,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her."
103458,L562465,u3073,m201,KULOK,My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
103459,L562464,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?"
103460,L562463,u3073,m201,KULOK,What's this country coming to?
103461,L562462,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,He thinks he looks young.
103462,L562461,u3073,m201,KULOK,Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
103463,L562460,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Look at this fellow... or this one.
103464,L562458,u3073,m201,KULOK,Sex.
103465,L562457,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,What's that?
103466,L562456,u3073,m201,KULOK,And one other thing.
103467,L562455,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
103468,L562454,u3073,m201,KULOK,"I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me."
103469,L562453,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us."
103470,L562452,u3073,m201,KULOK,You got a point there.
103471,L562451,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?"
103472,L562450,u3073,m201,KULOK,This is some serious shit.
103473,L562449,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: ""I went live last month."""
103474,L562448,u3073,m201,KULOK,"""Gone live?"""
103475,L562447,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler."
103476,L562446,u3073,m201,KULOK,They're all criminals?
103477,L562445,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence."
103478,L562444,u3073,m201,KULOK,You want to have dinner?
103479,L562443,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,The other reason?
103480,L562442,u3073,m201,KULOK,That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
103481,L562441,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying ""friends"" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, ""How to Plant Perennials."" Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how."
103482,L562440,u3073,m201,KULOK,What about the chat rooms themselves?
103483,L562439,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes ""ghosted,"" invisible."
103484,L562438,u3073,m201,KULOK,Don't even go there. What's up?
103485,L562437,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,The man knew how to dress.
103486,L562436,u3073,m201,KULOK,Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
103487,L562418,u3073,m201,KULOK,It explains a lot.
103488,L562417,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Yes I do.
103489,L562408,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Where's my watch? It's gone.
103490,L562407,u3073,m201,KULOK,Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
103491,L562336,u3073,m201,KULOK,A very sexy case.
103492,L562335,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,That information's being withheld from the media.
103493,L562334,u3073,m201,KULOK,And who kills in the manner of his victim.
103494,L562333,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists."
103495,L562332,u3073,m201,KULOK,Doesn't fit.
103496,L562331,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental."
103497,L562330,u3073,m201,KULOK,This is a sexy case.
103498,L562329,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?"
103499,L562328,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Why did he come out here? What's going on?
103500,L562327,u3073,m201,KULOK,Not especially.
103501,L562326,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You work with Koessler?
103502,L562325,u3073,m201,KULOK,Five months. I love it.
103503,L562324,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,How long have you been downtown?
103504,L562323,u3073,m201,KULOK,I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
103505,L562322,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"The Academy, then CIIAC."
103506,L562321,u3073,m201,KULOK,"You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?"
103507,L562320,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
103508,L562319,u3073,m201,KULOK,None taken.
103509,L562318,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense."
103510,L562317,u3073,m201,KULOK,Thanks for the ride.
103511,L562986,u3073,m201,KULOK,I'll be back.
103512,L562985,u3074,m201,LOW,"Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me."
103513,L562983,u3073,m201,KULOK,Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
103514,L562982,u3074,m201,LOW,No weapon.
103515,L562981,u3073,m201,KULOK,"Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon."
103516,L562963,u3073,m201,KULOK,I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
103517,L562962,u3074,m201,LOW,Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
103518,L562961,u3074,m201,LOW,"Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me."
103519,L562960,u3073,m201,KULOK,Mack must think Zero has a police band.
103520,L562955,u3073,m201,KULOK,Sit back.
103521,L562954,u3074,m201,LOW,Unlock these cuffs.
103522,L562931,u3074,m201,LOW,"Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?"
103523,L562930,u3073,m201,KULOK,Kulok.
103524,L562929,u3074,m201,LOW,Agent...
103525,L562994,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Yeah.
103526,L562993,u3074,m201,LOW,Was it Zero?
103527,L562992,u3074,m201,LOW,The boy's okay. I saw him...
103528,L562991,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Yeah.
103529,L562990,u3074,m201,LOW,Is he dead?
103530,L562799,u3074,m201,LOW,"Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya."
103531,L562798,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You? You went by the book?
103532,L562797,u3074,m201,LOW,"This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did."
103533,L562796,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Maybe you should back off.
103534,L562795,u3074,m201,LOW,We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
103535,L562794,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Those were just fantasies.
103536,L562793,u3074,m201,LOW,"I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --"
103537,L562792,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,It was the mall.
103538,L562791,u3074,m201,LOW,"You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone."
103539,L562790,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Who told you about her?
103540,L562789,u3074,m201,LOW,"If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater."
103541,L562788,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I already have an employer.
103542,L562787,u3074,m201,LOW,"There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man."
103543,L562786,u3074,m201,LOW,"Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart."
103544,L562785,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,You knew it was me all along?
103545,L562784,u3074,m201,LOW,"And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned."
103546,L562783,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,How do you know who's real and who's not?
103547,L562782,u3074,m201,LOW,"After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags."
103548,L562781,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
103549,L562780,u3074,m201,LOW,"Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?"
103550,L562779,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Zero killed them all?
103551,L562778,u3074,m201,LOW,"It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims."
103552,L562776,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found."
103553,L562775,u3074,m201,LOW,Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
103554,L562774,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"""Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."""
103555,L562773,u3074,m201,LOW,You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
103556,L562772,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I don't carry it with me.
103557,L562771,u3074,m201,LOW,"Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?"
103558,L562770,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,So you went underground?
103559,L562769,u3074,m201,LOW,"Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition."
103560,L562768,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Suspect Zero?
103561,L562767,u3074,m201,LOW,"I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive."
103562,L562766,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"What was your weakness, sir?"
103563,L562765,u3074,m201,LOW,"He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them."
103564,L562764,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,He's moved on to TV.
103565,L562763,u3074,m201,LOW,He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
103566,L562762,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz."
103567,L562761,u3074,m201,LOW,How's the arm?
103568,L562760,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops."
103569,L562759,u3074,m201,LOW,Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
103570,L562752,u3074,m201,LOW,"When you exit, head east on 10th."
103571,L562751,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Yes, sir."
103572,L562750,u3074,m201,LOW,This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
103573,L562749,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Yes.
103574,L562748,u3074,m201,LOW,Agent Mackelway?
103575,L562398,u3074,m201,LOW,"I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out."
103576,L562397,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Who are you?
103577,L562396,u3074,m201,LOW,The little piggie speaks.
103578,L562395,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,How did you know Speck was a killer?
103579,L562734,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
103580,L562733,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover."
103581,L562732,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
103582,L562731,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I want to go live with you.
103583,L562730,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[What does the file say?]
103584,L562729,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
103585,L562728,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[You tell me.]
103586,L562727,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
103587,L562726,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
103588,L562725,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
103589,L562724,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[Not the heart, the watch.]"
103590,L562723,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I want to help you.
103591,L562722,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]"
103592,L562721,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Let's talk about Zero.
103593,L562717,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you."
103594,L562716,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]"
103595,L562674,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]"
103596,L562673,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try."
103597,L562672,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
103598,L562671,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"If I owe, I will go."
103599,L562670,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]"
103600,L562669,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I've been to Chicago.
103601,L562667,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[Follow me.]
103602,L562666,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Lead the way, Murman."
103603,L562665,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]"
103604,L562659,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Something came up, Murman, my man."
103605,L562658,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[Lionheart, what happened?]"
103606,L562532,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Whatever happened to MyDick?
103607,L562531,u3076,m201,MURMAN,[Reality very risky.]
103608,L562478,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
103609,L562477,u3076,m201,MURMAN,"[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]"
103610,L562894,u3077,m201,SALINAS,Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
103611,L562893,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
103612,L562892,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?"
103613,L562891,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I don't think you understand.
103614,L562887,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero."
103615,L562886,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?"
103616,L562885,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo."
103617,L562884,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?"
103618,L562883,u3077,m201,SALINAS,350 miles.
103619,L562882,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,How far is Amarillo?
103620,L562420,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it."
103621,L562419,u3077,m201,SALINAS,But why attack an Agent?
103622,L562359,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I talked to him.
103623,L562358,u3077,m201,SALINAS,Speck is dead.
103624,L562357,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the ""item"" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick."
103625,L562356,u3077,m201,SALINAS,I don't...
103626,L562355,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
103627,L562354,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"""MyDick?"""
103628,L562302,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory."
103629,L562301,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,No.
103630,L562266,u3077,m201,SALINAS,The same.
103631,L562265,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Koessler?
103632,L562264,u3077,m201,SALINAS,This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
103633,L562263,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
103634,L562224,u3077,m201,SALINAS,Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
103635,L562223,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Yes, sir."
103636,L562222,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?"
103637,L562219,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen."
103638,L562218,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about."
103639,L562217,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket."
103640,L562216,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
103641,L562215,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"""Attitude Adjustment Issues"" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?"
103642,L562214,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Four hundred and sixty, sir."
103643,L562213,u3077,m201,SALINAS,I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
103644,L562212,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I screwed up twice, sir."
103645,L562211,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"""Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center."" Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here."
103646,L562210,u3077,m201,SALINAS,Sounds like fun.
103647,L562209,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir."
103648,L562208,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?"
103649,L562207,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,Thomas Mackelway.
103650,L562206,u3077,m201,SALINAS,"Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?"
103651,L562205,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I believe it's in my file, sir."
103652,L562204,u3077,m201,SALINAS,What did you do to end up here?
103653,L562203,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Yes, sir."
103654,L562202,u3077,m201,SALINAS,So you're the new meat?
103655,L562201,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir."
103656,L562978,u3078,m201,ZERO,Take your shirt off.
103657,L562977,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,It's over for you.
103658,L562976,u3078,m201,ZERO,"You want to ""profile"" me? Find out what makes me ""tick""? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?"
103659,L562972,u3078,m201,ZERO,"Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us."
103660,L562971,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
103661,L562970,u3078,m201,ZERO,Murman!
103662,L562969,u3075,m201,MACKELWAY,"I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart."
103663,L567042,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,"You're money, baby."
103664,L567041,u3088,m202,MIKE,Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
103665,L566830,u3088,m202,MIKE,Shut up.
103666,L566829,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,"Don't do it, Mike."
103667,L566155,u3088,m202,MIKE,Shuddup.
103668,L566154,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,You should call your Grandmother.
103669,L566150,u3088,m202,MIKE,"No. Stop, come on."
103670,L566149,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,Are you calling Her?
103671,L566148,u3088,m202,MIKE,Enough. I've got to use the phone.
103672,L566147,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,"You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges..."
103673,L566146,u3088,m202,MIKE,Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
103674,L566145,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,"That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it."
103675,L566144,u3088,m202,MIKE,It didn't feel that way.
103676,L566143,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
103677,L566142,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't know about that.
103678,L566141,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,Ever since I've known you.
103679,L566140,u3088,m202,MIKE,You're right. I know.
103680,L566139,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,You've been through worse.
103681,L566138,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I know, I know."
103682,L566137,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,You have to put things in perspective.
103683,L566136,u3088,m202,MIKE,Shit.
103684,L566135,u3079,m202,ANSWERING MACHINE,"Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message."
103685,L566743,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Thank you, Nikki."
103686,L566742,u3080,m202,BLONDE,Nikki.
103687,L566741,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Well, thank you...?"
103688,L566739,u3080,m202,BLONDE,You better pay the man.
103689,L566738,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever."
103690,L566737,u3080,m202,BLONDE,I'd say about two weeks.
103691,L566736,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago."
103692,L566735,u3080,m202,BLONDE,Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
103693,L566734,u3088,m202,MIKE,Are you sure? Maybe...
103694,L566733,u3080,m202,BLONDE,I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
103695,L566732,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas..."
103696,L566731,u3080,m202,BLONDE,What's that like?
103697,L566730,u3088,m202,MIKE,Yeah.
103698,L566729,u3080,m202,BLONDE,You're a comedian?
103699,L566728,u3088,m202,MIKE,...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
103700,L566727,u3080,m202,BLONDE,...maybe...
103701,L566726,u3088,m202,MIKE,You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
103702,L566725,u3080,m202,BLONDE,I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
103703,L566724,u3088,m202,MIKE,Thanks.
103704,L566721,u3080,m202,BLONDE,"I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you."
103705,L566720,u3088,m202,MIKE,You like laughing at the misery of others?
103706,L566659,u3088,m202,MIKE,Oh... a Cavalier.
103707,L566658,u3080,m202,BLONDE,What kind of car do you drive?
103708,L566657,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm sorry?
103709,L566656,u3080,m202,BLONDE,What do you drive?
103710,L566655,u3088,m202,MIKE,How are you ladies doing this evening?
103711,L566944,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,Mike...
103712,L566943,u3088,m202,MIKE,"No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to..."
103713,L566942,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,"Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of."
103714,L566941,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either..."
103715,L566940,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
103716,L566939,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Uh, if the guy wants to."
103717,L566938,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
103718,L566937,u3088,m202,MIKE,Anything.
103719,L566936,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,Anything?
103720,L566935,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want."
103721,L566934,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,To do what?
103722,L566933,u3088,m202,MIKE,What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
103723,L566932,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,What else?
103724,L566927,u3088,m202,MIKE,What what? What advantages?
103725,L566926,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,Like what?
103726,L566925,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single."
103727,L566924,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,How?
103728,L566923,u3088,m202,MIKE,It does.
103729,L566922,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,"Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better."
103730,L566921,u3088,m202,MIKE,It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
103731,L566920,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,I thought I was going to die.
103732,L566919,u3088,m202,MIKE,Yeah.
103733,L566918,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,You too?
103734,L566917,u3088,m202,MIKE,Tell me about it...
103735,L566916,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,"Well, I left someone very special behind."
103736,L566915,u3088,m202,MIKE,How was it hard?
103737,L566914,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,"Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah."
103738,L566913,u3088,m202,MIKE,Just like that?
103739,L566912,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,"...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here."
103740,L566909,u3088,m202,MIKE,Not lately.
103741,L566908,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,Why? You're not a real man?
103742,L566907,u3088,m202,MIKE,My reputation seems to have preceded me.
103743,L566906,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,I thought real men don't like quiche.
103744,L566905,u3088,m202,MIKE,I like quiche.
103745,L566904,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,Yes. Like the quiche.
103746,L566903,u3088,m202,MIKE,Like the quiche?
103747,L566902,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,"Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine."
103748,L566901,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm Mike.
103749,L566900,u3081,m202,BRUNETTE,Hi.
103750,L566899,u3088,m202,MIKE,Hi.
103751,L566789,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that ""the money""?"
103752,L566788,u3082,m202,CHARLES,...then ask where you met her...
103753,L566787,u3088,m202,MIKE,Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
103754,L566707,u3088,m202,MIKE,What else is going on?
103755,L566706,u3082,m202,CHARLES,They're out of Glenlivet.
103756,L566614,u3082,m202,CHARLES,Why not? This place is dead anyway.
103757,L566613,u3088,m202,MIKE,You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
103758,L566610,u3088,m202,MIKE,...you might get cut out.
103759,L566609,u3082,m202,CHARLES,...and even then...
103760,L566608,u3088,m202,MIKE,...not until you book it...
103761,L566607,u3082,m202,CHARLES,I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
103762,L566606,u3088,m202,MIKE,...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
103763,L566595,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East."
103764,L566594,u3082,m202,CHARLES,"No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway..."
103765,L566593,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Did you, um, did you get that pilot?"
103766,L566592,u3082,m202,CHARLES,Oh. You know.
103767,L566591,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Charles! What's up, man?"
103768,L566711,u3090,m202,ROB,"...I mean, does it have to be ""Goofy""? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud..."
103769,L566710,u3082,m202,CHARLES,"I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you..."
103770,L566620,u3090,m202,ROB,...Four days..?
103771,L566619,u3082,m202,CHARLES,...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
103772,L566612,u3082,m202,CHARLES,"Hey, man. At least it's Disney."
103773,L566611,u3090,m202,ROB,"I'm considering taking a job as a ""Goofy""."
103774,L566605,u3082,m202,CHARLES,"I still haven't told my folks I didn't get ""Deepspace 9"". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking..."
103775,L566604,u3090,m202,ROB,No.
103776,L566603,u3082,m202,CHARLES,"You haven't told then, huh?"
103777,L566602,u3090,m202,ROB,"I haven't heard an official ""no"" yet."
103778,L566601,u3082,m202,CHARLES,"Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?"
103779,L566597,u3090,m202,ROB,My pleasure.
103780,L566596,u3082,m202,CHARLES,Hi.
103781,L566411,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,Don't worry. He's in good hands.
103782,L566410,u3092,m202,TRENT,Let me just check on my boy.
103783,L566407,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,What an asshole.
103784,L566406,u3092,m202,TRENT,"It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four."
103785,L566389,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically..."
103786,L566388,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,They were auditioning for the same role as you?
103787,L566387,u3092,m202,TRENT,No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
103788,L566359,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,"Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names..."
103789,L566358,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town."
103790,L566357,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,"Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you."
103791,L566441,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,He is so sweet.
103792,L566440,u3085,m202,LISA,I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
103793,L566439,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,He's so sweet. He really said that?
103794,L566437,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
103795,L566436,u3085,m202,LISA,...And she's with someone else.
103796,L566435,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,The poor thing. Six years?
103797,L566397,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,Did you get it?
103798,L566396,u3085,m202,LISA,Oh my God.
103799,L566367,u3085,m202,LISA,"I'm a ""Dorothy""."
103800,L566366,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
103801,L566363,u3085,m202,LISA,No matter what... like splitting aces.
103802,L566362,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,Always...
103803,L566371,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm a comedian.
103804,L566370,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,What do you guys do?
103805,L566293,u3088,m202,MIKE,No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
103806,L566292,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,"Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free."
103807,L566291,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it."
103808,L566290,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,"Wait here, I'll get you that martini."
103809,L566289,u3088,m202,MIKE,Could you believe it?
103810,L566288,u3083,m202,CHRISTY,A couple of high rollers like you?
103811,L566240,u3084,m202,DEALER,"Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables."
103812,L566239,u3088,m202,MIKE,Do you have anything smaller?
103813,L566238,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Sure, that'll be fine."
103814,L566237,u3084,m202,DEALER,You want this in black chips.
103815,L566236,u3088,m202,MIKE,Huh?
103816,L566234,u3088,m202,MIKE,Oh... right.
103817,L566233,u3084,m202,DEALER,"You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it."
103818,L566232,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Uh, I don't want to bet it all."
103819,L566231,u3084,m202,DEALER,You have to lay it on the table.
103820,L566230,u3088,m202,MIKE,Sorry?
103821,L566229,u3084,m202,DEALER,On the table.
103822,L566424,u3085,m202,LISA,I understand.
103823,L566423,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Sorry, it's just that..."
103824,L566422,u3085,m202,LISA,"Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back."
103825,L566421,u3088,m202,MIKE,Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
103826,L566420,u3088,m202,MIKE,Six years.
103827,L566419,u3085,m202,LISA,"Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?"
103828,L566418,u3088,m202,MIKE,"We were a rebound, and we lasted six years."
103829,L566417,u3085,m202,LISA,It's a rebound.
103830,L566416,u3088,m202,MIKE,Why not?
103831,L566415,u3085,m202,LISA,Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
103832,L566414,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I know, but she did. She's with someone else now..."
103833,L566413,u3085,m202,LISA,I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
103834,L566382,u3085,m202,LISA,"What do you do, Trent?"
103835,L566381,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between..."
103836,L566380,u3085,m202,LISA,"Well, who represents you back east?"
103837,L566379,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet..."
103838,L566378,u3085,m202,LISA,Who's your booking agent?
103839,L566377,u3088,m202,MIKE,There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
103840,L566376,u3085,m202,LISA,Why not?
103841,L566375,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy..."
103842,L566374,u3085,m202,LISA,You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
103843,L566373,u3088,m202,MIKE,No...
103844,L566372,u3085,m202,LISA,Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
103845,L567044,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,"Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at ""The Room"". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might..."
103846,L567043,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on."
103847,L567040,u3088,m202,MIKE,That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
103848,L567039,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
103849,L567038,u3088,m202,MIKE,Hi. Sorry about that.
103850,L567031,u3088,m202,MIKE,"No, no. Hold on."
103851,L567030,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,I can call back...
103852,L567029,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Yeah, hold on."
103853,L567028,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,Are you on the other line?
103854,L567027,u3088,m202,MIKE,Lorraine?
103855,L567026,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,"Hi, Mike?"
103856,L567025,u3088,m202,MIKE,Hello?
103857,L566977,u3088,m202,MIKE,...get the hell outta here already...
103858,L566976,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,"...well, it suits you..."
103859,L566975,u3088,m202,MIKE,...The red piece of shit over there...
103860,L566974,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,...Which one...?
103861,L566973,u3088,m202,MIKE,...Nah. I'm right across the street...
103862,L566972,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,Can I give you a ride to your car...?
103863,L566971,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
103864,L566970,u3088,m202,MIKE,...It's really getting late.
103865,L566969,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,"Well, I should be getting..."
103866,L566968,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,"Hey, at least it's not Goofy."
103867,L566967,u3088,m202,MIKE,Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
103868,L566966,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,"Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from ""You Bet Your Life"", right?"
103869,L566965,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Why, you like the duck with the cigar?"
103870,L566964,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
103871,L566963,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into..."
103872,L566962,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
103873,L566961,u3088,m202,MIKE,When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
103874,L566960,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,It's not going to well?
103875,L566959,u3088,m202,MIKE,If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
103876,L566958,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,I'll have to come see you sometime.
103877,L566957,u3088,m202,MIKE,Yeah. And an actor.
103878,L566956,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,You're a comedian?
103879,L566955,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
103880,L566954,u3088,m202,MIKE,That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
103881,L566953,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,I'll be around.
103882,L566952,u3088,m202,MIKE,I would love to see you again sometime.
103883,L566951,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,Me too.
103884,L566950,u3088,m202,MIKE,Listen. I had a great time.
103885,L566949,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,Well... This is it.
103886,L566929,u3088,m202,MIKE,Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
103887,L566928,u3086,m202,LORRAINE,You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
103888,L567037,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,Goodbye. I lov...
103889,L567036,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye."
103890,L567035,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
103891,L567034,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call..."
103892,L567033,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,I heard you might be moving back...
103893,L567032,u3088,m202,MIKE,Hi.
103894,L567023,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,"No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens..."
103895,L567022,u3088,m202,MIKE,Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
103896,L567021,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,"...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre..."
103897,L567020,u3088,m202,MIKE,...the Michelin commercial...
103898,L567019,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
103899,L567018,u3088,m202,MIKE,Why didn't you call?
103900,L567017,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,"I miss you, Mike."
103901,L567016,u3088,m202,MIKE,Really?
103902,L567015,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
103903,L567014,u3088,m202,MIKE,I thought you met someone else.
103904,L567013,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,"You know, us."
103905,L567012,u3088,m202,MIKE,What kind of things?
103906,L567011,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,Yeah.
103907,L567010,u3088,m202,MIKE,Yeah?
103908,L567009,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,Good.  I think about things.
103909,L567008,u3088,m202,MIKE,Fine... I guess. You?
103910,L567007,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,How are you doing?
103911,L567006,u3088,m202,MIKE,...Six months.
103912,L567005,u3087,m202,MICHELLE,How's it going? It's been a while...
103913,L566885,u3088,m202,MIKE,You always know the right thing to say.
103914,L566884,u3090,m202,ROB,"By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight."
103915,L566883,u3090,m202,ROB,Sure.
103916,L566882,u3088,m202,MIKE,Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
103917,L566881,u3090,m202,ROB,...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
103918,L566880,u3088,m202,MIKE,You miss the pain?
103919,L566879,u3090,m202,ROB,"Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile."
103920,L566878,u3088,m202,MIKE,How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
103921,L566877,u3090,m202,ROB,"Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it."
103922,L566876,u3088,m202,MIKE,Then why won't she call...?
103923,L566875,u3090,m202,ROB,"That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are ""money""."
103924,L566874,u3088,m202,MIKE,I didn't make it...
103925,L566873,u3090,m202,ROB,"See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too..."
103926,L566872,u3090,m202,ROB,They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
103927,L566871,u3088,m202,MIKE,They turned you down?
103928,L566870,u3090,m202,ROB,At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
103929,L566869,u3088,m202,MIKE,How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
103930,L566868,u3090,m202,ROB,"Well, you're doing so well..."
103931,L566867,u3088,m202,MIKE,What's dumb about it?
103932,L566866,u3090,m202,ROB,"Well, that's dumb."
103933,L566865,u3088,m202,MIKE,I think I'm gonna move Back East.
103934,L566864,u3090,m202,ROB,She wasn't your type anyway.
103935,L566863,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm such an asshole.
103936,L566862,u3090,m202,ROB,Oh boy.
103937,L566861,u3088,m202,MIKE,Uuuuugh!
103938,L566860,u3090,m202,ROB,It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
103939,L566859,u3088,m202,MIKE,What's the point?
103940,L566858,u3090,m202,ROB,You want to talk about it?
103941,L566857,u3090,m202,ROB,Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
103942,L566856,u3088,m202,MIKE,Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
103943,L566855,u3088,m202,MIKE,No. Just O.J.
103944,L566854,u3090,m202,ROB,"You haven't been drinking, have you?"
103945,L566852,u3090,m202,ROB,"No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?"
103946,L566851,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Thanks, man."
103947,L566653,u3090,m202,ROB,I'll be your winger.
103948,L566652,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
103949,L566651,u3090,m202,ROB,"Go for it, man."
103950,L566650,u3088,m202,MIKE,"No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later."
103951,L566649,u3090,m202,ROB,"You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown."
103952,L566648,u3088,m202,MIKE,I got to at least try once.
103953,L566647,u3090,m202,ROB,It's unbelievable.
103954,L566646,u3088,m202,MIKE,There are so many beautiful women here.
103955,L566643,u3088,m202,MIKE,"He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though."
103956,L566642,u3090,m202,ROB,Him?
103957,L566641,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...""A Boy Named Sue"". I think that's why he's such a bad cat."
103958,L566640,u3090,m202,ROB,"Oh, like that song..."
103959,L566639,u3088,m202,MIKE,Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
103960,L566638,u3090,m202,ROB,What's that guy's name? Sue?
103961,L566633,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Well, let's hit that party."
103962,L566632,u3090,m202,ROB,...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
103963,L566600,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...yeah, a month ago."
103964,L566599,u3090,m202,ROB,I just tested for one...
103965,L566598,u3088,m202,MIKE,Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
103966,L566589,u3090,m202,ROB,There's the rub.
103967,L566588,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Ah, there's the rub..."
103968,L566587,u3090,m202,ROB,I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
103969,L566586,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts."
103970,L566585,u3090,m202,ROB,"It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it."
103971,L566584,u3088,m202,MIKE,I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
103972,L566583,u3090,m202,ROB,Darwinism at its best.
103973,L566582,u3088,m202,MIKE,I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
103974,L566581,u3090,m202,ROB,I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
103975,L566580,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please."
103976,L566579,u3090,m202,ROB,Bud.
103977,L566578,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'll get a Dewars rocks...
103978,L566577,u3090,m202,ROB,Classy.
103979,L566576,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Kinda money, huh?"
103980,L566575,u3088,m202,MIKE,...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
103981,L566574,u3090,m202,ROB,Sounds more like Aids...
103982,L566573,u3088,m202,MIKE,"It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism..."
103983,L566572,u3090,m202,ROB,That doesn't sound too good for business.
103984,L566571,u3088,m202,MIKE,"It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front."
103985,L566570,u3090,m202,ROB,Oh.  Where is this place?
103986,L566569,u3088,m202,MIKE,To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
103987,L566568,u3090,m202,ROB,"So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?"
103988,L566518,u3088,m202,MIKE,Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
103989,L566517,u3090,m202,ROB,An eight.
103990,L566516,u3088,m202,MIKE,What'd you get?
103991,L566515,u3090,m202,ROB,I'll give you an eight.
103992,L566514,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't know. Eight or Nine.
103993,L566513,u3090,m202,ROB,How many strokes?
103994,L566511,u3090,m202,ROB,Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
103995,L566510,u3088,m202,MIKE,What do you have? A Pluto call back?
103996,L566509,u3090,m202,ROB,"I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight."
103997,L566508,u3088,m202,MIKE,You want to hit the town tonight?
103998,L566505,u3088,m202,MIKE,I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
103999,L566504,u3090,m202,ROB,"I do. Good for you, man."
104000,L566503,u3088,m202,MIKE,The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
104001,L566502,u3090,m202,ROB,"Well, until now. Tend the pin."
104002,L566501,u3088,m202,MIKE,I didn't mention her once today.
104003,L566500,u3090,m202,ROB,Oh no?
104004,L566499,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't talk about her that much.
104005,L566498,u3090,m202,ROB,Kinda.
104006,L566497,u3088,m202,MIKE,"What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?"
104007,L566496,u3090,m202,ROB,I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
104008,L566495,u3088,m202,MIKE,Why?
104009,L566494,u3090,m202,ROB,I didn't want to say anything.
104010,L566493,u3088,m202,MIKE,Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
104011,L566492,u3090,m202,ROB,"It's like ""Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."""
104012,L566491,u3088,m202,MIKE,You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
104013,L566490,u3090,m202,ROB,Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
104014,L566489,u3088,m202,MIKE,What do you want? You're tall.
104015,L566488,u3090,m202,ROB,"There's just something about being ""Goofy"". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character."
104016,L566487,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town."
104017,L566486,u3090,m202,ROB,It's definitely a step back for me.
104018,L566485,u3088,m202,MIKE,You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
104019,L566484,u3090,m202,ROB,"I mean, I need the money."
104020,L566483,u3088,m202,MIKE,It's a gig.
104021,L566482,u3090,m202,ROB,I don't think I'm gonna take it.
104022,L566130,u3090,m202,ROB,"Thanks. Thanks, man."
104023,L566129,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her."
104024,L566128,u3090,m202,ROB,No problem.
104025,L566127,u3088,m202,MIKE,...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
104026,L566126,u3090,m202,ROB,"Hey man, don't sweat it."
104027,L566125,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time..."
104028,L566124,u3090,m202,ROB,There's the rub.
104029,L566123,u3088,m202,MIKE,There's the rub.
104030,L566122,u3090,m202,ROB,"Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore."
104031,L566121,u3088,m202,MIKE,Unless she comes back first.
104032,L566120,u3090,m202,ROB,"I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care."
104033,L566119,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Right... Wait, what do you mean?"
104034,L566118,u3090,m202,ROB,Right... or more likely the opposite.
104035,L566117,u3088,m202,MIKE,"So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her."
104036,L566116,u3090,m202,ROB,It sucks.
104037,L566115,u3088,m202,MIKE,Well that sucks.
104038,L566114,u3090,m202,ROB,Right.
104039,L566113,u3088,m202,MIKE,So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
104040,L566112,u3090,m202,ROB,"The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back."
104041,L566111,u3088,m202,MIKE,So what's the difference?
104042,L566110,u3090,m202,ROB,Right.
104043,L566109,u3088,m202,MIKE,So I don't call either way.
104044,L566108,u3090,m202,ROB,Right.
104045,L566107,u3088,m202,MIKE,But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
104046,L566106,u3090,m202,ROB,You don't call.
104047,L566105,u3088,m202,MIKE,And what if I don't want to give up on her?
104048,L566989,u3088,m202,MIKE,"She's really special, guys."
104049,L566988,u3091,m202,SUE,"Good for you, man. He's being smart."
104050,L566897,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?"
104051,L566896,u3091,m202,SUE,"Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days."
104052,L566895,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it."
104053,L566894,u3091,m202,SUE,"But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going..."
104054,L566893,u3091,m202,SUE,"We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk."
104055,L566892,u3088,m202,MIKE,What are they doing here?
104056,L566891,u3091,m202,SUE,"I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun"
104057,L566819,u3091,m202,SUE,...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
104058,L566818,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...It was six months, and she didn't dump..."
104059,L566817,u3091,m202,SUE,"What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago..."
104060,L566816,u3088,m202,MIKE,You live in such a fantasy world...
104061,L566812,u3091,m202,SUE,...People get carjacked...
104062,L566811,u3088,m202,MIKE,Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
104063,L566808,u3091,m202,SUE,"Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A..."
104064,L566807,u3088,m202,MIKE,"You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?"
104065,L566802,u3088,m202,MIKE,You asshole.
104066,L566801,u3091,m202,SUE,He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
104067,L566748,u3088,m202,MIKE,She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
104068,L566747,u3091,m202,SUE,She was cute.
104069,L566705,u3088,m202,MIKE,I can't believe you.
104070,L566704,u3091,m202,SUE,"Big butt... you know, can't fly coach."
104071,L566683,u3091,m202,SUE,Rejected?
104072,L566682,u3088,m202,MIKE,Not well.
104073,L566681,u3091,m202,SUE,How's it going for you two?
104074,L566635,u3091,m202,SUE,Damned if I know...
104075,L566634,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Who threw this party, anyway?"
104076,L566629,u3091,m202,SUE,...He's derivative...
104077,L566628,u3088,m202,MIKE,...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
104078,L566565,u3088,m202,MIKE,He's trying to be an actor.
104079,L566564,u3091,m202,SUE,What's he do?
104080,L566558,u3088,m202,MIKE,"So, what? Eleven?"
104081,L566557,u3091,m202,SUE,...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
104082,L566548,u3088,m202,MIKE,Give me the money. I'll get it.
104083,L566547,u3091,m202,SUE,Pause it.
104084,L566545,u3091,m202,SUE,"No, man, we're in the play-offs."
104085,L566544,u3088,m202,MIKE,Make someone bleed.
104086,L566543,u3091,m202,SUE,"It's kinda money, actually."
104087,L566527,u3091,m202,SUE,"Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup."
104088,L566526,u3088,m202,MIKE,You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
104089,L566523,u3088,m202,MIKE,Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
104090,L566522,u3091,m202,SUE,You little bitch!
104091,L566846,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Wow, I guess you were home..."
104092,L566845,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Don't call me ever again.
104093,L566844,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?"
104094,L566843,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Mike?
104095,L566842,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months..."
104096,L566841,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
104097,L566840,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all..."
104098,L566839,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
104099,L566838,u3088,m202,MIKE,I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike.
104100,L566837,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message.
104101,L566836,u3088,m202,MIKE,"213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye."
104102,L566835,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
104103,L566834,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is..."
104104,L566833,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
104105,L566832,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679..."
104106,L566831,u3089,m202,NIKKI,Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
104107,L566355,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,"Hang on, Voltaire."
104108,L566354,u3088,m202,MIKE,Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
104109,L566339,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I'll have ""pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment""."
104110,L566338,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,That's right.
104111,L566337,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Coffee...  Two coffees. It says ""Breakfast Any Time"", right?"
104112,L566336,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,Are you ready to order?
104113,L566287,u3088,m202,MIKE,Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
104114,L566286,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
104115,L566997,u3092,m202,TRENT,Oh. He's got it under control...
104116,L566996,u3088,m202,MIKE,Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
104117,L566987,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight."
104118,L566986,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Don't give me that! She liked you, man."
104119,L566985,u3088,m202,MIKE,It's not like that...
104120,L566981,u3092,m202,TRENT,You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
104121,L566980,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good."
104122,L566979,u3092,m202,TRENT,You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
104123,L566800,u3088,m202,MIKE,"What an asshole. Didn't you see ""Boys in the Hood""? Now one of us is gonna get shot."
104124,L566799,u3092,m202,TRENT,What the fuck..?
104125,L566782,u3092,m202,TRENT,Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
104126,L566781,u3088,m202,MIKE,"So, two days?"
104127,L566778,u3092,m202,TRENT,No...
104128,L566777,u3088,m202,MIKE,Tomorrow?
104129,L566776,u3092,m202,TRENT,A day.
104130,L566775,u3088,m202,MIKE,How long do I wait to call?
104131,L566766,u3092,m202,TRENT,"No, baby!"
104132,L566765,u3088,m202,MIKE,"You're not just, like, fucking with me?"
104133,L566753,u3092,m202,TRENT,We're not messing with you...
104134,L566752,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Please, don't mess with me right now..."
104135,L566746,u3092,m202,TRENT,What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
104136,L566745,u3088,m202,MIKE,What a surprise.
104137,L566744,u3092,m202,TRENT,"We got the digits, baby."
104138,L566698,u3088,m202,MIKE,That doesn't matter.
104139,L566697,u3092,m202,TRENT,She didn't see.
104140,L566696,u3088,m202,MIKE,"You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up."
104141,L566695,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?"
104142,L566694,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
104143,L566693,u3092,m202,TRENT,Was I money?
104144,L566680,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up."
104145,L566679,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm sorry.
104146,L566676,u3088,m202,MIKE,She didn't notice.
104147,L566675,u3092,m202,TRENT,"You looked right at her, baby."
104148,L566674,u3088,m202,MIKE,What?
104149,L566673,u3092,m202,TRENT,What are you doing?
104150,L566671,u3092,m202,TRENT,Minnie Pearl.
104151,L566670,u3088,m202,MIKE,Which one?
104152,L566669,u3092,m202,TRENT,It's on.
104153,L566668,u3088,m202,MIKE,How you guys doing?
104154,L566624,u3092,m202,TRENT,...It looked money.
104155,L566623,u3088,m202,MIKE,...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
104156,L566618,u3092,m202,TRENT,...through the kitchen...
104157,L566617,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...the Copa, in New York..."
104158,L566563,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Yeah. He's a ""rounder""."
104159,L566562,u3088,m202,MIKE,Yeah. You met him once.
104160,L566561,u3092,m202,TRENT,Who? Rob?
104161,L566556,u3092,m202,TRENT,It starts at eight...
104162,L566555,u3088,m202,MIKE,What time's this party tonight?
104163,L566553,u3092,m202,TRENT,Aww... He got away?
104164,L566552,u3088,m202,MIKE,You guys are such assholes.
104165,L566542,u3092,m202,TRENT,Yeah.
104166,L566541,u3088,m202,MIKE,No.
104167,L566537,u3088,m202,MIKE,What? That was the best part of the old game.
104168,L566536,u3092,m202,TRENT,No. Doesn't that suck?
104169,L566535,u3088,m202,MIKE,This version doesn't have fighting?
104170,L566534,u3092,m202,TRENT,I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
104171,L566480,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off."
104172,L566479,u3088,m202,MIKE,I hear she's getting real fat.
104173,L566478,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Please. And you're sweating him? You're ""all that"" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?"
104174,L566477,u3088,m202,MIKE,I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
104175,L566476,u3092,m202,TRENT,What?!?
104176,L566475,u3088,m202,MIKE,He drives a carriage.
104177,L566474,u3092,m202,TRENT,See? And what does this guy she's with do?
104178,L566473,u3088,m202,MIKE,Selling scrap metal.
104179,L566472,u3092,m202,TRENT,...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
104180,L566471,u3088,m202,MIKE,...a day...
104181,L566470,u3092,m202,TRENT,You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
104182,L566469,u3088,m202,MIKE,Don't remind me.
104183,L566468,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat."
104184,L566467,u3088,m202,MIKE,I just need some time...
104185,L566466,u3092,m202,TRENT,"That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby."
104186,L566465,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better."
104187,L566464,u3092,m202,TRENT,How?
104188,L566463,u3088,m202,MIKE,That was different.
104189,L566462,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Michelle went for you, right."
104190,L566461,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you."
104191,L566460,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, you're so money you don't even know it."
104192,L566459,u3088,m202,MIKE,I just don't think she liked me in that way.
104193,L566458,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip."
104194,L566457,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Yeah, a good friend."
104195,L566456,u3092,m202,TRENT,I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
104196,L566455,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't think so.
104197,L566454,u3092,m202,TRENT,She thought you were money.
104198,L566453,u3088,m202,MIKE,"She didn't like me, anyway."
104199,L566452,u3092,m202,TRENT,"No, baby. You're money."
104200,L566451,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
104201,L566450,u3092,m202,TRENT,"She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?"
104202,L566449,u3088,m202,MIKE,She was hot.
104203,L566448,u3092,m202,TRENT,"I didn't even like her, to be honest."
104204,L566447,u3088,m202,MIKE,Christy was nice...
104205,L566446,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time."
104206,L566445,u3088,m202,MIKE,Sorry about interrupting...
104207,L566444,u3092,m202,TRENT,"You didn't have to get into it, baby."
104208,L566443,u3088,m202,MIKE,She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
104209,L566432,u3092,m202,TRENT,Hold on.
104210,L566431,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man."
104211,L566430,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, you'll check them tomorrow."
104212,L566429,u3088,m202,MIKE,I gotta use the phone.
104213,L566428,u3092,m202,TRENT,What?
104214,L566427,u3088,m202,MIKE,"No, man. I need to use the phone."
104215,L566405,u3088,m202,MIKE,"So, what'd you say to him? ""Double down.""?"
104216,L566404,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like ""How old is the Brother?"". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says ""Eleven."""
104217,L566403,u3088,m202,MIKE,...So give me the fuckin part...
104218,L566400,u3092,m202,TRENT,I'm telling you!
104219,L566399,u3088,m202,MIKE,No! Not the camera guy!
104220,L566398,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like ""Wait a second"". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy."
104221,L566395,u3092,m202,TRENT,Yes!
104222,L566394,u3088,m202,MIKE,No!
104223,L566393,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Wait... Wait... Just ""Brother"". So I go in. ""Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..."" Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying..."
104224,L566392,u3088,m202,MIKE,"""Big Brother"", ""Little Brother""?"
104225,L566391,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Oh... ""I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..."" Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother."
104226,L566390,u3088,m202,MIKE,What was the part?
104227,L566369,u3088,m202,MIKE,Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
104228,L566368,u3092,m202,TRENT,Oh... a Dorothy.
104229,L566365,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job."
104230,L566364,u3088,m202,MIKE,Whatever.
104231,L566361,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?"
104232,L566360,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I'm Mike...  and this is my friend ""Doubledown Trent""."
104233,L566353,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, we're money."
104234,L566352,u3088,m202,MIKE,We didn't do so bad after all.
104235,L566351,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine."
104236,L566350,u3088,m202,MIKE,I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
104237,L566349,u3092,m202,TRENT,You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
104238,L566348,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...It's just, I thought ""Renaissance"" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though..."
104239,L566347,u3092,m202,TRENT,...Baby...
104240,L566346,u3088,m202,MIKE,"""Age of Enlightenment"". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said ""Let me jump your ignorant bones.""..."
104241,L566345,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, you did fine."
104242,L566344,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head."
104243,L566343,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Nice, baby."
104244,L566335,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party."
104245,L566334,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect..."
104246,L566333,u3092,m202,TRENT,"They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it."
104247,L566332,u3088,m202,MIKE,I know. I know.
104248,L566331,u3092,m202,TRENT,"That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?"
104249,L566330,u3088,m202,MIKE,"That was so fuckin' money. It was like that ""Jedi mind"" shit."
104250,L566324,u3092,m202,TRENT,Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
104251,L566323,u3088,m202,MIKE,"...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to..."
104252,L566322,u3092,m202,TRENT,...gotta...
104253,L566321,u3088,m202,MIKE,"It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy..."
104254,L566320,u3092,m202,TRENT,"You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there."
104255,L566319,u3088,m202,MIKE,"It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know..."
104256,L566318,u3092,m202,TRENT,It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
104257,L566317,u3088,m202,MIKE,That's bullshit.
104258,L566316,u3092,m202,TRENT,"You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them."
104259,L566315,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't know...
104260,L566314,u3092,m202,TRENT,Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
104261,L566313,u3088,m202,MIKE,She likes you.
104262,L566312,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you."
104263,L566311,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
104264,L566310,u3092,m202,TRENT,You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
104265,L566309,u3088,m202,MIKE,You think so?
104266,L566308,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, did you hear her? ""You shouldn't leave without getting something for free."" She wants to party, baby."
104267,L566307,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't think so.
104268,L566306,u3092,m202,TRENT,I know she's coming back.
104269,L566305,u3088,m202,MIKE,"What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?"
104270,L566304,u3092,m202,TRENT,Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
104271,L566303,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it."
104272,L566302,u3092,m202,TRENT,"She was smiling at how money I am, baby."
104273,L566301,u3088,m202,MIKE,She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
104274,L566300,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Did she, or did she not smile."
104275,L566299,u3088,m202,MIKE,I can't believe what an asshole you are.
104276,L566298,u3092,m202,TRENT,"She smiled, baby."
104277,L566297,u3088,m202,MIKE,That was so demeaning...
104278,L566296,u3092,m202,TRENT,That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
104279,L566295,u3088,m202,MIKE,What an asshole.
104280,L566285,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner."
104281,L566284,u3088,m202,MIKE,What an asshole.
104282,L566283,u3092,m202,TRENT,Mikey's the big winner.
104283,L566282,u3092,m202,TRENT,Who's the big winner?
104284,L566281,u3088,m202,MIKE,Let's go.
104285,L566280,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, you're money. You're the big winner."
104286,L566279,u3088,m202,MIKE,Let's just leave.
104287,L566278,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, don't talk like that, baby."
104288,L566277,u3088,m202,MIKE,You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
104289,L566276,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table."
104290,L566275,u3088,m202,MIKE,Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
104291,L566274,u3092,m202,TRENT,"I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe."
104292,L566273,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Yea, how much?"
104293,L566272,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Hey, man, I'm down too, you know."
104294,L566271,u3088,m202,MIKE,Thanks for clarifying that.
104295,L566270,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...Well, you know, not counting the first table."
104296,L566260,u3088,m202,MIKE,But I lost! How can you say always?!?
104297,L566259,u3092,m202,TRENT,Always.
104298,L566258,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I'm just saying, not in this particular case."
104299,L566257,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Always, baby."
104300,L566256,u3088,m202,MIKE,Yeah? Well obviously not always!
104301,L566255,u3092,m202,TRENT,"I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven."
104302,L566251,u3092,m202,TRENT,"If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well..."
104303,L566250,u3088,m202,MIKE,...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
104304,L566249,u3092,m202,TRENT,You gotta do it.
104305,L566248,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I know, but..."
104306,L566247,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven."
104307,L566246,u3088,m202,MIKE,What?!?
104308,L566245,u3092,m202,TRENT,Double down.
104309,L566227,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching."
104310,L566226,u3092,m202,TRENT,You think they're watching?
104311,L566225,u3088,m202,MIKE,That's where we make our scene.
104312,L566224,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Well, you look money, baby. We both look money."
104313,L566223,u3088,m202,MIKE,"The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free."
104314,L566222,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby."
104315,L566221,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around."
104316,L566220,u3092,m202,TRENT,What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
104317,L566219,u3088,m202,MIKE,First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
104318,L566218,u3092,m202,TRENT,"We're gonna get laid, baby."
104319,L566217,u3088,m202,MIKE,You're gonna screw up our plan.
104320,L566216,u3092,m202,TRENT,"I'm telling you, they love that shit."
104321,L566215,u3088,m202,MIKE,It doesn't matter...
104322,L566214,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Did she, or did she not smile?"
104323,L566213,u3088,m202,MIKE,That's not cool.
104324,L566212,u3092,m202,TRENT,She smiled baby.
104325,L566211,u3088,m202,MIKE,Cut that shit out.
104326,L566209,u3092,m202,TRENT,What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
104327,L566208,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift."
104328,L566207,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, there are beautiful babies here."
104329,L566206,u3088,m202,MIKE,They're all skanks.
104330,L566205,u3092,m202,TRENT,"That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby."
104331,L566204,u3088,m202,MIKE,This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
104332,L566203,u3092,m202,TRENT,"You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money."
104333,L566202,u3088,m202,MIKE,This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
104334,L566201,u3092,m202,TRENT,"This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates."
104335,L566200,u3088,m202,MIKE,Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
104336,L566198,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!"
104337,L566197,u3088,m202,MIKE,Whu?
104338,L566196,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Wake up, baby."
104339,L566195,u3088,m202,MIKE,Vegas.
104340,L566194,u3092,m202,TRENT,Vegas.
104341,L566193,u3088,m202,MIKE,Vegas!
104342,L566192,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Vegas, baby!"
104343,L566191,u3088,m202,MIKE,Vegas!
104344,L566190,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!"
104345,L566189,u3088,m202,MIKE,Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
104346,L566188,u3092,m202,TRENT,"I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!"
104347,L566187,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
104348,L566186,u3092,m202,TRENT,"I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing."
104349,L566185,u3088,m202,MIKE,"I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though."
104350,L566184,u3092,m202,TRENT,Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
104351,L566183,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works."
104352,L566182,u3092,m202,TRENT,Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
104353,L566181,u3088,m202,MIKE,"No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit."
104354,L566180,u3092,m202,TRENT,Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
104355,L566179,u3088,m202,MIKE,"What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits."
104356,L566178,u3092,m202,TRENT,What?
104357,L566177,u3088,m202,MIKE,Wait.
104358,L566176,u3092,m202,TRENT,Just bring your card. Half an hour.
104359,L566175,u3088,m202,MIKE,I can't lose more than a hundred.
104360,L566174,u3092,m202,TRENT,Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
104361,L566173,u3088,m202,MIKE,I'm not going to Vegas.
104362,L566172,u3092,m202,TRENT,I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
104363,L566171,u3088,m202,MIKE,You're crazy.
104364,L566170,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Tonight, baby."
104365,L566169,u3088,m202,MIKE,When?
104366,L566168,u3092,m202,TRENT,We're going to Vegas.
104367,L566167,u3088,m202,MIKE,What Vegas?
104368,L566166,u3092,m202,TRENT,VEGAS.
104369,L566165,u3088,m202,MIKE,What are you talking about? Vegas?
104370,L566164,u3092,m202,TRENT,"You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas."
104371,L566163,u3088,m202,MIKE,"We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke."
104372,L566162,u3092,m202,TRENT,"I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment."
104373,L566161,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't know...
104374,L566160,u3092,m202,TRENT,Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
104375,L566159,u3088,m202,MIKE,"Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow..."
104376,L566158,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there."
104377,L566157,u3088,m202,MIKE,I don't know...
104378,L566156,u3092,m202,TRENT,That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
104379,L566153,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Lemme get off the other line, baby."
104380,L566152,u3088,m202,MIKE,S'up Trent?
104381,L566151,u3092,m202,TRENT,Hello?
104382,L566999,u3092,m202,TRENT,Our little baby's growing up...
104383,L566998,u3091,m202,SUE,"...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore."
104384,L566995,u3091,m202,SUE,...just be smart about it.
104385,L566994,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...Okay, two..."
104386,L566993,u3091,m202,SUE,You don't have to wait three days...
104387,L566992,u3092,m202,TRENT,I'm telling you. Wait three days...
104388,L566991,u3091,m202,SUE,Be smart about it.
104389,L566990,u3092,m202,TRENT,The bear's got his claws back.
104390,L566984,u3091,m202,SUE,...Definitely...
104391,L566983,u3092,m202,TRENT,Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
104392,L566982,u3091,m202,SUE,Sorry man.
104393,L566948,u3092,m202,TRENT,...it is so on.
104394,L566947,u3091,m202,SUE,It is on.
104395,L566931,u3091,m202,SUE,...it's definitely on.
104396,L566930,u3092,m202,TRENT,It's on.
104397,L566911,u3091,m202,SUE,...it's on.
104398,L566910,u3092,m202,TRENT,It's on...
104399,L566824,u3092,m202,TRENT,Sue!
104400,L566823,u3091,m202,SUE,"I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch..."
104401,L566822,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...Shut up, Sue..."
104402,L566821,u3091,m202,SUE,Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
104403,L566820,u3092,m202,TRENT,...Sue...
104404,L566815,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...Oh yeah, like ""Cypress Hill"" was gonna do anything..."
104405,L566814,u3091,m202,SUE,Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
104406,L566813,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat."
104407,L566810,u3091,m202,SUE,"...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey."
104408,L566809,u3092,m202,TRENT,...Anaheim...
104409,L566804,u3091,m202,SUE,What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
104410,L566803,u3092,m202,TRENT,You dick.
104411,L566791,u3091,m202,SUE,Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
104412,L566790,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party."
104413,L566786,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Yeah, but three days is kinda the money..."
104414,L566785,u3091,m202,SUE,...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
104415,L566784,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?"
104416,L566783,u3091,m202,SUE,Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
104417,L566780,u3092,m202,TRENT,...Yeah.
104418,L566779,u3091,m202,SUE,"...Tomorrow, then a day."
104419,L566772,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like."
104420,L566771,u3091,m202,SUE,You're money.
104421,L566770,u3092,m202,TRENT,Now go over there and get those digits.
104422,L566769,u3091,m202,SUE,...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
104423,L566768,u3092,m202,TRENT,...you're money...
104424,L566767,u3091,m202,SUE,...honestly...
104425,L566764,u3091,m202,SUE,...you're like a big bear.
104426,L566763,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...and fangs... and you're like ""I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?""..."
104427,L566762,u3091,m202,SUE,...and you got big claws and fangs...
104428,L566761,u3092,m202,TRENT,...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
104429,L566760,u3091,m202,SUE,...You're just poking at it...
104430,L566759,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...And you're just looking at your claws like ""How do I kill this bunny?""..."
104431,L566758,u3091,m202,SUE,...shivering...
104432,L566757,u3092,m202,TRENT,...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
104433,L566756,u3091,m202,SUE,...and big fuckin' teeth...
104434,L566755,u3092,m202,TRENT,You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
104435,L566754,u3091,m202,SUE,...we're not...
104436,L566751,u3092,m202,TRENT,"That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know..."
104437,L566750,u3091,m202,SUE,"You are so money, and you don't even know it..."
104438,L566749,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, don't talk that way, baby..."
104439,L566717,u3091,m202,SUE,True.
104440,L566716,u3092,m202,TRENT,...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
104441,L566715,u3091,m202,SUE,...double diamond...
104442,L566714,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail..."
104443,L566713,u3091,m202,SUE,You think?
104444,L566712,u3092,m202,TRENT,It's on.
104445,L566700,u3092,m202,TRENT,What was cold about it?
104446,L566699,u3091,m202,SUE,"That was pretty cold, dude."
104447,L566678,u3092,m202,TRENT,Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
104448,L566677,u3091,m202,SUE,Yes she did.
104449,L566667,u3092,m202,TRENT,"See, baby?"
104450,L566666,u3091,m202,SUE,"No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked."
104451,L566665,u3092,m202,TRENT,Is she looking now?
104452,L566664,u3091,m202,SUE,No.
104453,L566663,u3092,m202,TRENT,Now?
104454,L566662,u3091,m202,SUE,No.
104455,L566661,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Is she looking at me, baby?"
104456,L566645,u3091,m202,SUE,...It's on.
104457,L566644,u3092,m202,TRENT,"Oh, it's on, baby..."
104458,L566567,u3091,m202,SUE,...How novel.
104459,L566566,u3092,m202,TRENT,What a surprise...
104460,L566551,u3091,m202,SUE,...Is he brown?
104461,L566550,u3092,m202,TRENT,Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
104462,L566540,u3091,m202,SUE,Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
104463,L566539,u3092,m202,TRENT,"You could make their heads bleed, though."
104464,L566538,u3091,m202,SUE,I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
104465,L566531,u3091,m202,SUE,Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
104466,L566530,u3092,m202,TRENT,They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
104467,L566529,u3091,m202,SUE,They're a finesse team...
104468,L566528,u3092,m202,TRENT,...against the computer.
104469,L566525,u3091,m202,SUE,That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
104470,L566524,u3092,m202,TRENT,Because he's a bitch.
104471,L566521,u3092,m202,TRENT,Chelios to Roenick...!
104472,L566520,u3091,m202,SUE,Bitch... You little bitch!
104473,L566342,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,I'll be back with the coffee.
104474,L566341,u3092,m202,TRENT,I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
104475,L566340,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,And you?
104476,L566328,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,Six.
104477,L566327,u3092,m202,TRENT,Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
104478,L566326,u3093,m202,WAITRESS,"Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water."
104479,L566325,u3092,m202,TRENT,"...One fifty-nine, Two minutes."
104480,L593445,u3102,m203,HAGEN,You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
104481,L593444,u3094,m203,BONASERA,"Yes, I understand I'm listening."
104482,L593443,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request."
104483,L593425,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Yes.
104484,L593424,u3094,m203,BONASERA,The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
104485,L593423,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Good.  He never doubted you.
104486,L593422,u3094,m203,BONASERA,Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
104487,L593421,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him."
104488,L593420,u3094,m203,BONASERA,"Yes, I understand.  I'm listening."
104489,L593432,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is."
104490,L593431,u3094,m203,BONASERA,What do you wish me to do?
104491,L592864,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return."
104492,L592863,u3094,m203,BONASERA,Godfather.
104493,L592862,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
104494,L592861,u3094,m203,BONASERA,Be my friend.
104495,L592860,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you..."
104496,L592859,u3094,m203,BONASERA,America has been good to me...
104497,L592858,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money."
104498,L592857,u3094,m203,BONASERA,Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
104499,L592856,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,But your daughter is still alive.
104500,L592855,u3094,m203,BONASERA,An eye for an eye!
104501,L592854,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,The Court gave you justice.
104502,L592853,u3094,m203,BONASERA,I ask for Justice.
104503,L592852,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,No.  You ask for too much.
104504,L592851,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,And what is that Bonasera?
104505,L592850,u3094,m203,BONASERA,"What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!"
104506,L592849,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends."
104507,L593724,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport."
104508,L593723,u3095,m203,CARLO,Barzini.
104509,L593722,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?"
104510,L593721,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did."
104511,L593720,u3095,m203,CARLO,"I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!"
104512,L593719,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
104513,L593718,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You have to answer for Santino.
104514,L593717,u3095,m203,CARLO,Godfather!
104515,L593704,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Go back to your house and wait for me...
104516,L593703,u3095,m203,CARLO,"Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike..."
104517,L593638,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I'll come to you when I need you.
104518,L593637,u3095,m203,CARLO,Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
104519,L593408,u3097,m203,CONNIE,Like hell I will.
104520,L593407,u3095,m203,CARLO,You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
104521,L593406,u3097,m203,CONNIE,BA FA GOULE YOU!
104522,L593405,u3095,m203,CARLO,Ba Fa Goulle.
104523,L593404,u3097,m203,CONNIE,"Eat it, it's on the table."
104524,L593403,u3095,m203,CARLO,I'm not hungry yet.
104525,L593402,u3097,m203,CONNIE,The food is on the table.
104526,L593401,u3095,m203,CARLO,"OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?"
104527,L593400,u3097,m203,CONNIE,You're staying home.  You're not going out.
104528,L593398,u3097,m203,CONNIE,"Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!"
104529,L593397,u3095,m203,CARLO,What was that?
104530,L593381,u3095,m203,CARLO,Shut up.
104531,L593380,u3097,m203,CONNIE,"What's the matter, Carlo?"
104532,L593327,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,We gotta move...
104533,L593326,u3112,m203,SONNY,"You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right."
104534,L593325,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,The gun will be there.
104535,L593324,u3112,m203,SONNY,"I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand."
104536,L593235,u3112,m203,SONNY,"OK, but be careful."
104537,L593234,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
104538,L593229,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
104539,L593228,u3112,m203,SONNY,You take care of Paulie?
104540,L593185,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news."
104541,L593184,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,Understood.
104542,L593183,u3112,m203,SONNY,Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
104543,L593099,u3112,m203,SONNY,"No, just you and Paulie."
104544,L593098,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
104545,L593097,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house."
104546,L593096,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,"Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years..."
104547,L593095,u3112,m203,SONNY,How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
104548,L593094,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
104549,L593093,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?"
104550,L593092,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
104551,L593091,u3112,m203,SONNY,Yeah.
104552,L593090,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,You heard about your father?
104553,L593628,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Maybe less...
104554,L593627,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
104555,L593626,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father."
104556,L593620,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting."
104557,L593619,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
104558,L593312,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,"Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble..."
104559,L593311,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,How bad will it be?
104560,L593310,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
104561,L593209,u3109,m203,PAULIE,"Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing."
104562,L593208,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,"Maybe, or you gotta know now."
104563,L593207,u3109,m203,PAULIE,You think we'll go for that last place?
104564,L593202,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,"OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'."
104565,L593201,u3109,m203,PAULIE,Good for ten men...
104566,L593199,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
104567,L593198,u3109,m203,PAULIE,I'll think about it.
104568,L593182,u3109,m203,PAULIE,Sure.
104569,L593181,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,Outside.
104570,L593176,u3109,m203,PAULIE,The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
104571,L593175,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,"I tol' you to stay put, Paulie..."
104572,L592872,u3096,m203,CLEMENZA,"What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay."
104573,L592871,u3109,m203,PAULIE,You look terrif on the floor!
104574,L593025,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
104575,L593024,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,No.
104576,L593023,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,Are you worried about security for your million?
104577,L593022,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed."
104578,L593019,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone."
104579,L593018,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?"
104580,L593017,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
104581,L593016,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
104582,L593015,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
104583,L593014,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,What percentages for my family?
104584,L593013,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend."
104585,L593012,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
104586,L593011,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous."
104587,L592971,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
104588,L592970,u3103,m203,JOHNNY,"It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot."
104589,L592969,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want."
104590,L592968,u3103,m203,JOHNNY,Sure.
104591,L592967,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,You take care of your family?
104592,L592966,u3103,m203,JOHNNY,"He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself."
104593,L592965,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work."
104594,L592957,u3103,m203,JOHNNY,"I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up..."
104595,L592956,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?"
104596,L592955,u3103,m203,JOHNNY,"I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather."
104597,L593651,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Maybe I can help.
104598,L593650,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen."
104599,L593461,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along."
104600,L593460,u3102,m203,HAGEN,He was the one behind Sollozzo?
104601,L593459,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Barzini.
104602,L593458,u3102,m203,HAGEN,You mean Tattaglia.
104603,L593457,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told."
104604,L593456,u3102,m203,HAGEN,When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
104605,L593439,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Now you've had your drink.
104606,L593438,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Yes.
104607,L593437,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,But you needed a drink first.
104608,L593436,u3102,m203,HAGEN,I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
104609,L593435,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows."
104610,L593030,u3102,m203,HAGEN,It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
104611,L593029,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,What is this nonsense?
104612,L592976,u3102,m203,HAGEN,I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
104613,L592975,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?"
104614,L592974,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?"
104615,L592973,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
104616,L592949,u3102,m203,HAGEN,It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
104617,L592948,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
104618,L592947,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Should I bring him in.
104619,L592946,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
104620,L592944,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait."
104621,L592943,u3102,m203,HAGEN,This morning.
104622,L592942,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,When did he call?
104623,L592941,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify."
104624,L592940,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,And with prison record.
104625,L592939,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"He's his own boss, and very competent."
104626,L592937,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo."
104627,L592936,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
104628,L592890,u3102,m203,HAGEN,You understand him better than anyone.
104629,L592889,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Is it necessary?
104630,L593663,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Good.
104631,L593662,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Yes.
104632,L593661,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
104633,L593659,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety..."
104634,L593658,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,How?
104635,L593657,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Barzini will move against you first.
104636,L593656,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out ""Kill me, kill me.""  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man."
104637,L593655,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I'll need him.
104638,L593654,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,I see you have your Luca Brasi.
104639,L593644,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,How did you find out?
104640,L593643,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
104641,L593553,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,What else do you believe in?
104642,L593552,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
104643,L593551,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice."
104644,L593550,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Then why have I become a man like you?
104645,L593549,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America."
104646,L593548,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You wanted me to be your son.
104647,L593547,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"No, I wanted other things for you."
104648,L593546,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me."
104649,L593545,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Accept what's happened, Michael."
104650,L593544,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when."
104651,L593543,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know."
104652,L593542,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,No.
104653,L593541,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
104654,L592991,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you."
104655,L592990,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I'm going to finish school.
104656,L592989,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"And now, what do you choose to do?"
104657,L592988,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
104658,L592987,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,What miracles you do for strangers.
104659,L592986,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,For killing a man.
104660,L592985,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,And this?
104661,L592984,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,For bravery.
104662,L592983,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,What was this for?
104663,L592982,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Tom said he'd take care of it.
104664,L592981,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
104665,L592881,u3107,m203,NAZORINE,An Act of Congress!
104666,L592880,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen."
104667,L592879,u3107,m203,NAZORINE,"Godfather, you understand everything."
104668,L592878,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,You want him to stay in this country.
104669,L592877,u3107,m203,NAZORINE,"Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they..."
104670,L592876,u3098,m203,DON CORLEONE,"Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do."
104671,L592875,u3107,m203,NAZORINE,"...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war..."
104672,L593527,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,"Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed."
104673,L593526,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,What is it?
104674,L593525,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,"Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away."
104675,L593524,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Is that why there are more men on the walls?
104676,L593523,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,"The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name."
104677,L593522,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Things went badly in Palermo?
104678,L593474,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
104679,L593473,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,"That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car."
104680,L593472,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
104681,L593471,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
104682,L593470,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
104683,L593469,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
104684,L593468,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Corleone.
104685,L593467,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,Where are you going?
104686,L593466,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I know.
104687,L593465,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
104688,L593464,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
104689,L593463,u3099,m203,DON TOMMASSINO,"Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa."
104690,L593462,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Don Tommassino.
104691,L593530,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks..."
104692,L593529,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
104693,L593528,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
104694,L593487,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Shhhhh.
104695,L593486,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,"Hey, beautiful girls!"
104696,L593482,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,"Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  ""Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."""
104697,L593481,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Yes.
104698,L593480,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
104699,L593479,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
104700,L593478,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
104701,L593477,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,How do you know I come from America?
104702,L593476,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,You tell us about America.
104703,L593515,u3114,m203,VITELLI,"Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village."
104704,L593514,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,"It's the real Thunderbolt, then."
104705,L593499,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,"And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth."
104706,L593498,u3114,m203,VITELLI,"Beautiful all over, eh?"
104707,L593497,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,"This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?"
104708,L593496,u3114,m203,VITELLI,I know about what you mean!
104709,L593495,u3100,m203,FABRIZZIO,This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
104710,L593494,u3114,m203,VITELLI,"You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight."
104711,L593599,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me."
104712,L593598,u3101,m203,FREDO,"Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him."
104713,L593575,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
104714,L593574,u3101,m203,FREDO,"Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business."
104715,L593572,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Get rid of them...
104716,L593571,u3101,m203,FREDO,Mike!
104717,L593570,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Give them some money and send them home.
104718,L593569,u3101,m203,FREDO,That's for you to find out.
104719,L593568,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Who are those girls?
104720,L593567,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Come here a minute, Fredo."
104721,L593566,u3101,m203,FREDO,Mike!  The party starting!
104722,L593565,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,No.
104723,L593564,u3101,m203,FREDO,Ever seen anything like that before?
104724,L593561,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"You look good, too."
104725,L593560,u3101,m203,FREDO,"You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face."
104726,L593559,u3101,m203,FREDO,"He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner."
104727,L593558,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
104728,L593393,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore."
104729,L593392,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation."
104730,L593391,u3112,m203,SONNY,"No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me."
104731,L593390,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money."
104732,L593389,u3112,m203,SONNY,We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
104733,L593384,u3102,m203,HAGEN,We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
104734,L593383,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Pop, they hit us and we hit them back."
104735,L593331,u3112,m203,SONNY,Can you do it Mike?
104736,L593330,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Jesus, I don't know..."
104737,L593321,u3102,m203,HAGEN,No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
104738,L593320,u3112,m203,SONNY,One of Tattaglia's people?
104739,L593299,u3112,m203,SONNY,McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
104740,L593298,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration."
104741,L593297,u3112,m203,SONNY,"No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?"
104742,L593296,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal..."
104743,L593295,u3112,m203,SONNY,And when they shot me father...
104744,L593294,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business."
104745,L593293,u3112,m203,SONNY,Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
104746,L593292,u3102,m203,HAGEN,The other families won't sit still for all out war.
104747,L593291,u3112,m203,SONNY,"No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street."
104748,L593290,u3102,m203,HAGEN,We should hear what they have to say.
104749,L593289,u3112,m203,SONNY,Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
104750,L593288,u3102,m203,HAGEN,What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
104751,L593287,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse."
104752,L593286,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Was there a definite proposal?
104753,L593187,u3112,m203,SONNY,"OK forget it, just stay on the phone."
104754,L593186,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
104755,L593173,u3112,m203,SONNY,"OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day."
104756,L593172,u3102,m203,HAGEN,We're all tired...
104757,L593171,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way."
104758,L593170,u3102,m203,HAGEN,I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
104759,L593169,u3112,m203,SONNY,That's easy to say; it's not your father.
104760,L593168,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny."
104761,L593167,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?"
104762,L593165,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number."
104763,L593164,u3112,m203,SONNY,"No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up."
104764,L593163,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
104765,L593162,u3112,m203,SONNY,If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
104766,L593161,u3102,m203,HAGEN,What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
104767,L593159,u3112,m203,SONNY,The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
104768,L593158,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Is the hospital covered?
104769,L592963,u3112,m203,SONNY,Okay.  One minute.
104770,L592962,u3102,m203,HAGEN,The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
104771,L593376,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Mama, no."
104772,L593375,u3104,m203,KAY,Will you give this letter to Michael.
104773,L593371,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you."
104774,L593370,u3104,m203,KAY,Will you give this to him.
104775,L593368,u3104,m203,KAY,"Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?"
104776,L593367,u3102,m203,HAGEN,An accident.  No one was hurt.
104777,L593366,u3104,m203,KAY,What was that?
104778,L593365,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all."
104779,L593364,u3104,m203,KAY,I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
104780,L593363,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call..."
104781,L593125,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense."
104782,L593124,u3102,m203,HAGEN,I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
104783,L593123,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
104784,L593122,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
104785,L593121,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business."
104786,L593119,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
104787,L593118,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it."
104788,L593010,u3116,m203,WOLTZ,"Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!"
104789,L593009,u3102,m203,HAGEN,I'm German-Irish.
104790,L593008,u3116,m203,WOLTZ,"You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!"
104791,L593007,u3102,m203,HAGEN,He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
104792,L593006,u3116,m203,WOLTZ,"Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else."
104793,L593005,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship."
104794,L593684,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe."
104795,L593683,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Have you agreed on a meeting?
104796,L593682,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
104797,L593681,u3102,m203,HAGEN,How will they come at you?
104798,L593680,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
104799,L593679,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Did he give you his politicians?
104800,L593678,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him."
104801,L593649,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones..."
104802,L593648,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
104803,L593647,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"Mike, why am I out?"
104804,L593646,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Not so perfectly if you noticed.
104805,L593645,u3102,m203,HAGEN,Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
104806,L593642,u3102,m203,HAGEN,"I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?"
104807,L593641,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that."

104906,L592897,u3104,m203,KAY,Why do they bother him on a day like this?
104907,L592896,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right."

104914,L593258,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
104915,L593257,u3108,m203,NURSE,Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
104916,L593256,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
104917,L593255,u3108,m203,NURSE,You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
104918,L593251,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You just stand here one minute...
104919,L593250,u3108,m203,NURSE,Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
104920,L593249,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
104921,L593329,u3112,m203,SONNY,Probably a year...
104922,L593328,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
104923,L593316,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign."
104924,L593315,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,A million times.
104925,L593314,u3112,m203,SONNY,"What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?"
104926,L593313,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
104927,L593305,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both."
104928,L593304,u3112,m203,SONNY,Go on Mike.
104929,L593301,u3112,m203,SONNY,The kid's right.
104930,L593300,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now."
104931,L593285,u3112,m203,SONNY,The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
104932,L593284,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Cut it out.
104933,L593283,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Mikey, you look beautiful!"
104934,L593254,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I won't panic.
104935,L593253,u3112,m203,SONNY,"All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic."
104936,L593252,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected."
104937,L593233,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things."
104938,L593232,u3112,m203,SONNY,Send some bodyguards.
104939,L593231,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,To the city.
104940,L593230,u3112,m203,SONNY,Where are you going?
104941,L593156,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
104942,L593155,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Christ, if I could only contact Luca."
104943,L593154,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"All right, Sonny.  All right."
104944,L593153,u3112,m203,SONNY,"I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range."
104945,L593152,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,That's not how Pop would have played it.
104946,L593151,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together."
104947,L593150,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop."
104948,L593149,u3112,m203,SONNY,Until the old man tells me different.
104949,L593148,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?"
104950,L593147,u3112,m203,SONNY,"On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad."
104951,L593146,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,How can you be sure?
104952,L593145,u3112,m203,SONNY,"You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie."
104953,L593144,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it."
104954,L593143,u3112,m203,SONNY,One of them fingered the old man.
104955,L593142,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,What?
104956,L593141,u3112,m203,SONNY,"All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?"
104957,L593140,u3112,m203,SONNY,Theresa.
104958,L593139,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny."
104959,L593138,u3112,m203,SONNY,"Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this."
104960,L593137,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I can help you out...
104961,L593136,u3112,m203,SONNY,Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
104962,L593135,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,How's Mom?
104963,L593134,u3112,m203,SONNY,I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
104964,L593348,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
104965,L593347,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,What is it?
104966,L593346,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce..."
104967,L593345,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
104968,L593339,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,Maybe.
104969,L593338,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,We're going to New Jersey?
104970,L593335,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him."
104971,L593334,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
104972,L593333,u3111,m203,SOLLOZZO,"I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened."
104973,L593698,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I do wish to be baptized.
104974,L593697,u3110,m203,PRIEST,Do you wish to be baptized?
104975,L593696,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I do renounce them.
104976,L593695,u3110,m203,PRIEST,And all his works?
104977,L593694,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I do renounce him.
104978,L593693,u3110,m203,PRIEST,Do you renounce Satan.
104979,L593687,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"Yes, I promise."
104980,L593686,u3110,m203,PRIEST,Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
104981,L593677,u3113,m203,TESSIO,I can arrange security.
104982,L593676,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,He talked to you?
104983,L593675,u3113,m203,TESSIO,Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
104984,L593631,u3113,m203,TESSIO,"Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  The two  go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us."
104985,L593630,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
104986,L593629,u3113,m203,TESSIO,Let us fill up our Regimes.
104987,L593618,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Be patient.
104988,L593617,u3113,m203,TESSIO,"I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs."
104989,L593616,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Just be patient.
104990,L593615,u3113,m203,TESSIO,Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
104991,L593597,u3106,m203,MOE,"You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders."
104992,L593596,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
104993,L593595,u3106,m203,MOE,"Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink."
104994,L593594,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You straightened my brother out?
104995,L593591,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
104996,L593590,u3106,m203,MOE,"The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!"
104997,L593589,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
104998,L593588,u3106,m203,MOE,"You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out."
104999,L593587,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,You're unlucky.
105000,L593586,u3106,m203,MOE,You think I scam?
105001,L593585,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
105002,L593584,u3106,m203,MOE,The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
105003,L593583,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,"The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out."
105004,L593582,u3106,m203,MOE,Buy me out?...
105005,L593581,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
105006,L593580,u3106,m203,MOE,The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
105007,L593579,u3105,m203,MICHAEL,Thanks.
105008,L593578,u3106,m203,MOE,"Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?"
105009,L593083,u3112,m203,SONNY,Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
105010,L593082,u3115,m203,VOICE,"I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more."
105011,L593081,u3112,m203,SONNY,Is he alive?
105012,L593080,u3115,m203,VOICE,"Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago."
105013,L593079,u3112,m203,SONNY,I think so.  Detective squad?
105014,L593078,u3115,m203,VOICE,Do you recognize my voice?
105015,L593077,u3112,m203,SONNY,Yeah.
105016,L568821,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
105017,L568820,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --"
105018,L568805,u3122,m204,MARGE,"It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys."
105019,L568804,u3117,m204,DICKIE,He's drowning me!
105020,L568723,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Okay.
105021,L568722,u3122,m204,MARGE,"If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together."
105022,L568709,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Yes please!
105023,L568708,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open."
105024,L568699,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Oh, it was."
105025,L568698,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I hope it wasn't cheap.
105026,L568697,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks."
105027,L568696,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you."
105028,L568692,u3117,m204,DICKIE,No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
105029,L568691,u3122,m204,MARGE,Oh darling -- is that for me?
105030,L568690,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Shut up.
105031,L568689,u3122,m204,MARGE,It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
105032,L568688,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
105033,L568687,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
105034,L568686,u3122,m204,MARGE,I don't like you.
105035,L568685,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Marge, you like everybody."
105036,L568684,u3122,m204,MARGE,"No, I like him."
105037,L568683,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You'd say if you mind?
105038,L568682,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Okay, darling."
105039,L568681,u3117,m204,DICKIE,It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
105040,L568670,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it."
105041,L568669,u3122,m204,MARGE,It's vile.
105042,L568668,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar."
105043,L568653,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Did you speak to my father?
105044,L568652,u3122,m204,MARGE,I'll come down.
105045,L568651,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye."
105046,L568650,u3122,m204,MARGE,Hi Tom.
105047,L568640,u3122,m204,MARGE,I don't get it.
105048,L568639,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Uncanny!
105049,L568636,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st."
105050,L568635,u3122,m204,MARGE,What? What?
105051,L568624,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
105052,L568623,u3122,m204,MARGE,I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
105053,L568619,u3122,m204,MARGE,Shut up!
105054,L568618,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Is that good?
105055,L568617,u3122,m204,MARGE,Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
105056,L568614,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Yes, Tom Ripley's here."
105057,L568613,u3117,m204,DICKIE,We?
105058,L568612,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Well, we ate everything without you."
105059,L568611,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing."
105060,L568610,u3122,m204,MARGE,You just woke up!
105061,L568609,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I just woke up. I'm sorry.
105062,L568608,u3122,m204,MARGE,Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
105063,L568607,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine."
105064,L568601,u3122,m204,MARGE,And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
105065,L568600,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Sure. Any time.
105066,L568599,u3122,m204,MARGE,"You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?"
105067,L568592,u3117,m204,DICKIE,What are you doing in Mongi?
105068,L568591,u3122,m204,MARGE,How do you do.
105069,L568886,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?"
105070,L568885,u3117,m204,DICKIE,What evening?
105071,L568884,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --"
105072,L568883,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
105073,L568882,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What?
105074,L568881,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while."
105075,L568880,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that."
105076,L568879,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Tom, I don't love you."
105077,L568878,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You love me and you're not marrying me.
105078,L568877,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I love Marge.
105079,L568876,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd."
105080,L568875,u3117,m204,DICKIE,How?
105081,L568874,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,How?
105082,L568873,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Marge and I are getting married.
105083,L568872,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me."
105084,L568871,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Oh God, I don't think so."
105085,L568870,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --"
105086,L568869,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Really? To Italy?
105087,L568868,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
105088,L568867,u3117,m204,DICKIE,So tell me.
105089,L568866,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I wanted to tell you my plan.
105090,L568862,u3117,m204,DICKIE,So cool.
105091,L568861,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What?
105092,L568860,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?"
105093,L568859,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
105094,L568858,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
105095,L568857,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Ha.
105096,L568856,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
105097,L568855,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Then I'll take it as a compliment.
105098,L568854,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example."
105099,L568853,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Why?
105100,L568852,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?"
105101,L568851,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Why are you asking all of a sudden?
105102,L568850,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?"
105103,L568849,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Esatto. I'm always planning.
105104,L568848,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Ripley's plans.
105105,L568847,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I've got plans!
105106,L568846,u3117,m204,DICKIE,That's good.
105107,L568845,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
105108,L568844,u3117,m204,DICKIE,To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
105109,L568843,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
105110,L568840,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?"
105111,L568839,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
105112,L568838,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?"
105113,L568837,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
105114,L568836,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
105115,L568835,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way..."
105116,L568833,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it."
105117,L568832,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault."
105118,L568831,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
105119,L568830,u3117,m204,DICKIE,What are you talking about?
105120,L568829,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'm prepared to take the blame.
105121,L568828,u3117,m204,DICKIE,She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
105122,L568819,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
105123,L568818,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?"
105124,L568794,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
105125,L568793,u3117,m204,DICKIE,He's downstairs.
105126,L568792,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Is Freddie here?
105127,L568791,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Freddie drove me back in his car.
105128,L568790,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I thought you'd missed the train.
105129,L568789,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Get undressed in your own room, would you?"
105130,L568788,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
105131,L568787,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Shoes too?
105132,L568779,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
105133,L568778,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
105134,L568777,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What club?
105135,L568776,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station."
105136,L568767,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
105137,L568766,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Freddie?
105138,L568765,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
105139,L568764,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
105140,L568763,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Relax.
105141,L568762,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?"
105142,L568760,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni."
105143,L568759,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
105144,L568758,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
105145,L568757,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
105146,L568756,u3117,m204,DICKIE,What does he say?
105147,L568752,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway."
105148,L568751,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I didn't mean with you in it.
105149,L568750,u3117,m204,DICKIE,No!
105150,L568749,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
105151,L568748,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
105152,L568747,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No, no brothers, no sisters."
105153,L568746,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Do you have any brothers?
105154,L568745,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Well we certainly know that's true.
105155,L568744,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
105156,L568743,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it."
105157,L568742,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain."
105158,L568741,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I know. I write like a child.
105159,L568740,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
105160,L568739,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
105161,L568738,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Now your signature.  Not ""Dickie"". Your signature."
105162,L568737,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient."
105163,L568736,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,No! I've got more than one shirt!
105164,L568735,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
105165,L568734,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Copy out from here...
105166,L568733,u3117,m204,DICKIE,The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
105167,L568732,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York."
105168,L568731,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs."
105169,L568730,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I played piano in a few places.
105170,L568729,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
105171,L568728,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You're breaking my ribs!
105172,L568727,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What?
105173,L568726,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You're breaking my ribs!
105174,L568715,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?"
105175,L568714,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,And Rome.
105176,L568713,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list."
105177,L568712,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I have to go to Venice.
105178,L568711,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Sure. I love Venice.
105179,L568710,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Could we sail to Venice?
105180,L568707,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
105181,L568706,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?"
105182,L568705,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back."
105183,L568704,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Your parents met her.
105184,L568703,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?"
105185,L568678,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?"
105186,L568677,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,This is so good of you.
105187,L568676,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
105188,L568675,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
105189,L568674,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Good afternoon!
105190,L568665,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Bird!
105191,L568664,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
105192,L568663,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
105193,L568660,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz."
105194,L568659,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I love jazz.
105195,L568658,u3117,m204,DICKIE,You like jazz!
105196,L568649,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard."
105197,L568648,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --"
105198,L568647,u3117,m204,DICKIE,It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
105199,L568646,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No, I think your mother, her illness --"
105200,L568645,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I'm never going back!
105201,L568643,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
105202,L568642,u3117,m204,DICKIE,What?
105203,L568641,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?"
105204,L568634,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Marge! You've got to hear this!
105205,L568633,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I met him in New York.
105206,L568632,u3117,m204,DICKIE,I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
105207,L568631,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise."
105208,L568630,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
105209,L568629,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them."
105210,L568628,u3117,m204,DICKIE,What? What's this?
105211,L568627,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
105212,L568626,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression."
105213,L568625,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
105214,L568622,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Sure.
105215,L568621,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Can you mix a martini?
105216,L568620,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'm intruding.
105217,L568616,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No, still here."
105218,L568615,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party."
105219,L568598,u3117,m204,DICKIE,That's funny.
105220,L568597,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"You know, a primer."
105221,L568596,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Say again?
105222,L568595,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's just an undercoat.
105223,L568594,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually."
105224,L568593,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
105225,L568590,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
105226,L568589,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?"
105227,L568588,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me."
105228,L568587,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Okay.  And did we know each other?
105229,L568586,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
105230,L568585,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Who's this?
105231,L568816,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,"Aye, aye."
105232,L568815,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Marge-maintenance.
105233,L568814,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,What are you doing?
105234,L568813,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
105235,L568812,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Sure.
105236,L568811,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Do you think you can steer this thing?
105237,L568810,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,"I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies..."
105238,L568809,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna."
105239,L568781,u3117,m204,DICKIE,"Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life."
105240,L568780,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Dick -- you've got to hear this!
105241,L568771,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,"Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!"
105242,L568770,u3117,m204,DICKIE,This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
105243,L568769,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
105244,L568768,u3117,m204,DICKIE,Frederico!
105245,L569050,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,"Is it on ""delle Croce, just off the Corso""? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you."
105246,L569049,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso."
105247,L569048,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
105248,L569047,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Freddie, do you have something to say?"
105249,L569046,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Have you done something to your hair?
105250,L569045,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Hardly.
105251,L569044,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
105252,L569043,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You should watch that!
105253,L569042,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
105254,L569041,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --"
105255,L569040,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
105256,L569039,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
105257,L569038,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
105258,L569037,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly."
105259,L569036,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,"He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart."
105260,L569035,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What about Christmas?
105261,L569034,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
105262,L569033,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
105263,L569032,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,"The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now."
105264,L569031,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I guess.
105265,L569030,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
105266,L569029,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?"
105267,L569028,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,"Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?"
105268,L569027,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley."
105269,L569025,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,It's Freddie. Let me in.
105270,L569024,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Who is it?
105271,L569023,u3118,m204,FREDDIE,Dickie?
105272,L569022,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Hello?
105273,L569290,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"No, he should talk to you alone."
105274,L569289,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
105275,L569288,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you."
105276,L569287,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
105277,L569286,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
105278,L569285,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Marge has been telling us about the rings.
105279,L569284,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?"
105280,L569283,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Tom.
105281,L569232,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children."
105282,L569231,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
105283,L569230,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
105284,L569229,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I think it might hurt her to know.
105285,L569228,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"No, Marge doesn't know the half of it."
105286,L569221,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie."
105287,L569220,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello."
105288,L569219,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
105289,L569213,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"Marge, good morning. Unusual weather."
105290,L569212,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Yes it is.
105291,L569211,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Far cry from New York.
105292,L569210,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I'm well, thank you."
105293,L569209,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Tom. How are you? You look well.
105294,L569208,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Mr Greenleaf.
105295,L568549,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Good. Now you can go for a reason.
105296,L568548,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but..."
105297,L568547,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars."
105298,L568532,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf..."
105299,L568531,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir."
105300,L568530,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
105301,L569282,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --"
105302,L569281,u3122,m204,MARGE,"I don't know, I don't know, I just know it."
105303,L569226,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
105304,L569225,u3122,m204,MARGE,Such as?
105305,L569224,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --"
105306,L569223,u3122,m204,MARGE,I just don't believe that!
105307,L569222,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself."
105308,L569218,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,"San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?"
105309,L569217,u3122,m204,MARGE,Where's Mr MacCarron?
105310,L569216,u3119,m204,HERBERT GREENLEAF,Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
105311,L568948,u3120,m204,JOAN,One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
105312,L568947,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Thanks, yes, I think we did."
105313,L568946,u3120,m204,JOAN,"I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy."
105314,L568945,u3120,m204,JOAN,I'm sure we've met.
105315,L568944,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
105316,L568943,u3120,m204,JOAN,Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
105317,L568942,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
105318,L569300,u3121,m204,MACCARRON,Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
105319,L569299,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I hope she never knows.
105320,L569298,u3121,m204,MACCARRON,"Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows."
105321,L569294,u3121,m204,MACCARRON,Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
105322,L569293,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Okay.
105323,L569292,u3121,m204,MACCARRON,I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
105324,L569291,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?"
105325,L569280,u3121,m204,MACCARRON,Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
105326,L569279,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Is Mr Greenleaf here?
105327,L569310,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Oh Marge.
105328,L569309,u3122,m204,MARGE,"I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you."
105329,L569308,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What?
105330,L569307,u3122,m204,MARGE,Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
105331,L569306,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --"
105332,L569305,u3122,m204,MARGE,"What are you going to do now, Tom?"
105333,L569304,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day."
105334,L569271,u3122,m204,MARGE,I don't believe a single word you've said.
105335,L569270,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's all true.
105336,L569269,u3122,m204,MARGE,I don't believe you.
105337,L569268,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
105338,L569267,u3122,m204,MARGE,Why? When?
105339,L569266,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I told you. He gave them to me.
105340,L569265,u3122,m204,MARGE,Why do you have Dickie's rings?
105341,L569264,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me."
105342,L569263,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize."
105343,L569262,u3122,m204,MARGE,I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
105344,L569261,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Marge? Where are you going?
105345,L569259,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Shut up! Shut up!
105346,L569258,u3122,m204,MARGE,He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
105347,L569257,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical."
105348,L569256,u3122,m204,MARGE,I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
105349,L569255,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
105350,L569254,u3122,m204,MARGE,Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
105351,L569253,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I can explain.
105352,L569252,u3122,m204,MARGE,You've got Dickie's rings.
105353,L569251,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What?
105354,L569250,u3122,m204,MARGE,I found Dickie's rings.
105355,L569249,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent."
105356,L569248,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long."
105357,L569247,u3122,m204,MARGE,Tom?
105358,L569237,u3122,m204,MARGE,Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
105359,L569236,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,He's having an early night.
105360,L569235,u3122,m204,MARGE,Did Dickie's Dad go?
105361,L569215,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"And you, sir? Any better?"
105362,L569214,u3122,m204,MARGE,Very.
105363,L569207,u3122,m204,MARGE,To the manner born.
105364,L569206,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Look at me what?
105365,L569195,u3122,m204,MARGE,He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
105366,L569194,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,That's a terrific idea.
105367,L569193,u3122,m204,MARGE,Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
105368,L569192,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I was looking forward to seeing him.
105369,L569187,u3122,m204,MARGE,Tom.
105370,L569186,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Hello Marge!
105371,L569185,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Hello Peter, so good to see you."
105372,L569081,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later."
105373,L569080,u3122,m204,MARGE,Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
105374,L569079,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --"
105375,L569078,u3122,m204,MARGE,Where does Dickie live?
105376,L569077,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Get on. I'll take you to him.
105377,L569076,u3122,m204,MARGE,What?
105378,L569075,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?"
105379,L569074,u3122,m204,MARGE,Dickie?
105380,L569073,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Dickie did it.
105381,L569072,u3122,m204,MARGE,"I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?"
105382,L569071,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
105383,L569070,u3122,m204,MARGE,Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
105384,L569069,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Marge, when did you get here?"
105385,L569068,u3122,m204,MARGE,Did he kill Freddie?
105386,L569012,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!"
105387,L569011,u3122,m204,MARGE,He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
105388,L569010,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
105389,L569009,u3122,m204,MARGE,Dickie was at the Opera last night.
105390,L568959,u3122,m204,MARGE,You were going to Venice.
105391,L568958,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest."
105392,L568957,u3122,m204,MARGE,Is he really not here?
105393,L568952,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley."
105394,L568951,u3122,m204,MARGE,Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
105395,L568950,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?"
105396,L568949,u3122,m204,MARGE,Oh my God. Tom.
105397,L568915,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I think you're right.
105398,L568914,u3122,m204,MARGE,He hates being confronted.
105399,L568911,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
105400,L568910,u3122,m204,MARGE,How long's he staying for?
105401,L568909,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone."
105402,L568908,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited..."
105403,L568907,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this."
105404,L568906,u3122,m204,MARGE,Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
105405,L568905,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me."
105406,L568904,u3122,m204,MARGE,What does that mean?
105407,L568903,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine."
105408,L568902,u3122,m204,MARGE,Ha. Did he say why?
105409,L568901,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
105410,L568900,u3122,m204,MARGE,Where's Dickie?
105411,L568899,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
105412,L568898,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks."
105413,L568897,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
105414,L568896,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Tom, you startled me! You're back."
105415,L568895,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Hello Marge.
105416,L568824,u3122,m204,MARGE,I'll go.
105417,L568823,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'll go and see what's the matter.
105418,L568822,u3122,m204,MARGE,Dickie!
105419,L568808,u3122,m204,MARGE,Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
105420,L568807,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What about Cortina?
105421,L568806,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way."
105422,L568803,u3122,m204,MARGE,He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
105423,L568802,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,So I'm learning.
105424,L568801,u3122,m204,MARGE,"The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold."
105425,L568800,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Sure.
105426,L568799,u3122,m204,MARGE,Are you okay?
105427,L568798,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'm fine.
105428,L568797,u3122,m204,MARGE,"You really should go in, it's marvelous."
105429,L568702,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,My fiance.
105430,L568701,u3122,m204,MARGE,Frances?
105431,L568700,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
105432,L568695,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's superb.
105433,L568694,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday."
105434,L568693,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,That ring's so great. The green one.
105435,L568680,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I absolutely agree with Marge.
105436,L568679,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life."
105437,L568667,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"He's not a man, he's a god."
105438,L568666,u3122,m204,MARGE,"Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man."
105439,L568662,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Bird. That's jazz.
105440,L568661,u3122,m204,MARGE,I never said that!
105441,L568656,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Back, I suppose, slowly as I can."
105442,L568655,u3122,m204,MARGE,Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
105443,L568654,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem."
105444,L568638,u3122,m204,MARGE,What's going on?
105445,L568637,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so."
105446,L569000,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?"
105447,L568999,u3122,m204,MARGE,How would you know that?
105448,L568998,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you."
105449,L568997,u3122,m204,MARGE,I told you! I knew it!
105450,L568996,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie."
105451,L568995,u3122,m204,MARGE,Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
105452,L569205,u3122,m204,MARGE,"No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you."
105453,L569204,u3124,m204,PETER,What's funny?
105454,L569203,u3122,m204,MARGE,A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
105455,L569202,u3124,m204,PETER,"That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels."
105456,L569201,u3122,m204,MARGE,This is spectacular.
105457,L569199,u3122,m204,MARGE,Golly. Who's paying for this?
105458,L569198,u3124,m204,PETER,"No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?"
105459,L569197,u3122,m204,MARGE,Is this you?
105460,L569191,u3122,m204,MARGE,He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
105461,L569190,u3124,m204,PETER,Where's Dickie's father?
105462,L569189,u3124,m204,PETER,I think we sort of found each other.
105463,L569188,u3122,m204,MARGE,So you found Peter...
105464,L569015,u3124,m204,PETER,"That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --"
105465,L569014,u3122,m204,MARGE,I hope so.
105466,L569013,u3124,m204,PETER,We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
105467,L569002,u3122,m204,MARGE,Do you know Tom?
105468,L569001,u3124,m204,PETER,"No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley."
105469,L568965,u3122,m204,MARGE,"I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people."
105470,L568964,u3124,m204,PETER,"Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!"
105471,L568954,u3122,m204,MARGE,No glasses.
105472,L568953,u3124,m204,PETER,"Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie."
105473,L569340,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone."
105474,L569339,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him."
105475,L569338,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You know what -- I am.
105476,L569337,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,So -- are you travelling under R?
105477,L569336,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?"
105478,L569335,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible."
105479,L569334,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
105480,L569333,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,You're kidding.
105481,L569332,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
105482,L569331,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
105483,L569330,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I've thought about you.
105484,L569329,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much."
105485,L569328,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Of course. Aunt Joan.
105486,L569327,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
105487,L569326,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Just kidding. Are you alone?
105488,L569325,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,What?
105489,L569324,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward."
105490,L569323,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you..."
105491,L569322,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Hello Meredith.
105492,L569321,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"Dickie, my God!"
105493,L568988,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Exactly. 10.30 --
105494,L568987,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
105495,L568986,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's."
105496,L568985,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight..."
105497,L568984,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Beating you away.
105498,L568983,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
105499,L568982,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"No, I absolutely understand. Of course."
105500,L568981,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't..."
105501,L568980,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
105502,L568979,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"Okay then, you're crazy."
105503,L568978,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us."
105504,L568977,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
105505,L568976,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
105506,L568975,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,I thought you were enjoying yourself?
105507,L568974,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Let's go.
105508,L568939,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'll take them both.
105509,L568938,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
105510,L568936,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,I've never admitted that to anyone.
105511,L568935,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I know.
105512,L568934,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it."
105513,L568933,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
105514,L568932,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --"
105515,L568931,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome."
105516,L568930,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R."
105517,L568929,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Is Freddie in Rome?
105518,L568928,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
105519,L568927,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,How did you know that?
105520,L568926,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
105521,L568925,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What?
105522,L568924,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?"
105523,L568577,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Right.
105524,L568576,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Randall.
105525,L568575,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too."
105526,L568574,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,As in the...?
105527,L568573,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue."
105528,L568572,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Emily.  Just kidding.
105529,L568571,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Which is?
105530,L568570,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
105531,L568569,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there."
105532,L568568,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
105533,L568567,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
105534,L568566,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,Hello.
105535,L568565,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello."
105536,L568564,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall."
105537,L568563,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,"No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating."
105538,L568562,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Excuse me?
105539,L568561,u3123,m204,MEREDITH,What's your secret?
105540,L569172,u3124,m204,PETER,They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
105541,L569171,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
105542,L569170,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,Hmm. C'e questa...
105543,L569169,u3124,m204,PETER,A ragione. A ragione.
105544,L569168,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!
105545,L569155,u3124,m204,PETER,Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
105546,L569154,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
105547,L569153,u3124,m204,PETER,He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
105548,L569152,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
105549,L569149,u3124,m204,PETER,Where have you been since then?
105550,L569148,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
105551,L569145,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf?
105552,L569144,u3124,m204,PETER,"He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder."
105553,L569143,u3127,m204,VERRECCHIA,"Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles."
105554,L569363,u3124,m204,PETER,...Tom is a mystery...
105555,L569362,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You're such a liar...
105556,L569361,u3124,m204,PETER,Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
105557,L569360,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
105558,L569359,u3124,m204,PETER,And don't forget. I have the key.
105559,L569358,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Peter, I... I..."
105560,L569357,u3124,m204,PETER,What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
105561,L569356,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
105562,L569355,u3124,m204,PETER,What do you mean lied about who you are?
105563,L569354,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me."
105564,L569353,u3124,m204,PETER,"Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost."
105565,L569352,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Well that would be even better gossip.
105566,L569351,u3124,m204,PETER,Or Tom and Peter even.
105567,L569350,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?"
105568,L569349,u3124,m204,PETER,Why lie?
105569,L569348,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
105570,L569347,u3124,m204,PETER,Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
105571,L569346,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
105572,L569345,u3124,m204,PETER,Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
105573,L569344,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Was who Meredith?
105574,L569343,u3124,m204,PETER,Was that Meredith?
105575,L569342,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
105576,L569341,u3124,m204,PETER,How was it?
105577,L569319,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too."
105578,L569318,u3124,m204,PETER,"You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person."
105579,L569317,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me."
105580,L569316,u3124,m204,PETER,"Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?"
105581,L569315,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,All kinds of things. Making plans.
105582,L569314,u3124,m204,PETER,Hello. What are you up to?
105583,L569313,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Nothing.
105584,L569312,u3124,m204,PETER,What do you want to change about this moment?
105585,L569311,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
105586,L569277,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I give up.
105587,L569276,u3124,m204,PETER,"Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?"
105588,L569275,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,You try. You try talking to her.
105589,L569274,u3124,m204,PETER,"Tom, are you okay?"
105590,L569245,u3124,m204,PETER,Or I could come back.
105591,L569244,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's okay.
105592,L569243,u3124,m204,PETER,Do you want me to stick around?
105593,L569242,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'm fine.
105594,L569241,u3124,m204,PETER,Are you okay?
105595,L569239,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'll fix some drinks.
105596,L569238,u3124,m204,PETER,Not guilty.
105597,L569234,u3124,m204,PETER,"You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?"
105598,L569233,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
105599,L569184,u3124,m204,PETER,"No key, huh?"
105600,L569183,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if..."
105601,L569181,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was..."
105602,L569180,u3124,m204,PETER,Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
105603,L569179,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do."
105604,L569178,u3124,m204,PETER,"But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody..."
105605,L569177,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel."
105606,L569176,u3124,m204,PETER,"Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?"
105607,L569167,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Just because he doesn't like Americans!
105608,L569166,u3124,m204,PETER,"He's already angry, I don't think --"
105609,L569165,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
105610,L569164,u3124,m204,PETER,He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
105611,L569162,u3124,m204,PETER,He says so many fiances.
105612,L569161,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What did he say?
105613,L569159,u3124,m204,PETER,"Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate."
105614,L569158,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them."
105615,L569157,u3124,m204,PETER,"No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient."
105616,L569156,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,No.
105617,L569151,u3124,m204,PETER,"I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un..."
105618,L569150,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I've been backpacking.
105619,L569147,u3124,m204,PETER,"A Roma, circa tre settimane fa."
105620,L569146,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one."
105621,L569139,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
105622,L569138,u3124,m204,PETER,"You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --"
105623,L569137,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --"
105624,L569136,u3124,m204,PETER,"That's good, isn't it?"
105625,L569135,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
105626,L569134,u3124,m204,PETER,Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
105627,L569133,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,It's okay.
105628,L569132,u3124,m204,PETER,"Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day."
105629,L569131,u3124,m204,PETER,"That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous."
105630,L569130,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What rumour?
105631,L569129,u3124,m204,PETER,"Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?"
105632,L569128,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten."
105633,L569018,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty."
105634,L569017,u3124,m204,PETER,But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
105635,L569016,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,My God.
105636,L569008,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
105637,L569007,u3124,m204,PETER,Not at all. Morning Tom.
105638,L569006,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?"
105639,L568973,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you."
105640,L568972,u3124,m204,PETER,We'll be there.
105641,L568971,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Ten thirty?
105642,L568970,u3124,m204,PETER,I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
105643,L568969,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
105644,L568968,u3124,m204,PETER,And tomorrow?
105645,L568967,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I can't later.
105646,L568966,u3124,m204,PETER,Will we see you later?
105647,L568963,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Thanks.
105648,L568962,u3124,m204,PETER,"Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?"
105649,L568961,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
105650,L568960,u3124,m204,PETER,"Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around."
105651,L568956,u3124,m204,PETER,"Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?"
105652,L568955,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Ditto.
105653,L569122,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Tomorrow.
105654,L569121,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
105655,L569120,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Absolutely.
105656,L569119,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
105657,L569118,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni."
105658,L569117,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,"You have, yes."
105659,L569116,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I have!
105660,L569115,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
105661,L569114,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"It is a little coarse, yes."
105662,L569113,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
105663,L569112,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
105664,L569111,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
105665,L569110,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when."
105666,L569109,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
105667,L569108,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Thank you.
105668,L569107,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later."
105669,L569106,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
105670,L569105,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,31 people.
105671,L569104,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,31 people.
105672,L569103,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day."
105673,L569102,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,"No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat."
105674,L569101,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,No!
105675,L569100,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Does he stay with you here?
105676,L569099,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,A few days ago.
105677,L569098,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
105678,L569097,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I don't remember the exact date.
105679,L569096,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,November 7th is my information.
105680,L569095,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
105681,L569094,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,"November, I thought."
105682,L569093,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago."
105683,L569091,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,What about Ripley?
105684,L569090,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,What about Thomas Ripley?
105685,L569089,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Even her.
105686,L569088,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Even your fiance...?
105687,L569087,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,I really don't want to see anybody.
105688,L569086,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,"Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance."
105689,L569085,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?"
105690,L569084,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
105691,L569083,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Of course. What happened to your face?
105692,L569082,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Can we go up? Do you mind?
105693,L569067,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,No.
105694,L569066,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car."
105695,L569065,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,"Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening."
105696,L569064,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Postmortem?
105697,L569063,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,"So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?"
105698,L569062,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"Yes, if it's going to help, certainly."
105699,L569061,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
105700,L569060,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?"
105701,L569059,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
105702,L569058,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,"I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car."
105703,L569057,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,"It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?"
105704,L569056,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
105705,L569055,u3125,m204,RIPLEY,Yes?
105706,L569054,u3126,m204,ROVERINI,Dickie Greenleaf?
105707,L569751,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Nah. I ain't interested.
105708,L569750,u3128,m205,ANDY,"I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box."
105709,L569749,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Huh?
105710,L569748,u3128,m205,ANDY,You like ball games?
105711,L569746,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first.  You got anything to carry these in?
105712,L569745,u3128,m205,ANDY,"It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over."
105713,L569744,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next."
105714,L569743,u3128,m205,ANDY,Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
105715,L569742,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Huh?
105716,L569741,u3128,m205,ANDY,You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
105717,L569740,u3128,m205,ANDY,"Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle."
105718,L569739,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Is there a firing range around?
105719,L569738,u3128,m205,ANDY,You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
105720,L569737,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Nah, this'll be fine."
105721,L569736,u3128,m205,ANDY,"Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building."
105722,L569735,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,How much to get a permit to carry?
105723,L569734,u3128,m205,ANDY,"The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one."
105724,L569733,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,How much for everything.
105725,L569732,u3128,m205,ANDY,"That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125."
105726,L569731,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
105727,L569730,u3128,m205,ANDY,"Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?"
105728,L569727,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I got money.
105729,L569726,u3128,m205,ANDY,That's an expensive gun.
105730,L569725,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,You got a .44 Magnum?
105731,L570071,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Sure.
105732,L570070,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?"
105733,L570069,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Yeah.
105734,L570068,u3129,m205,BETSY,Travis?
105735,L570067,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Thank you, Travis."
105736,L570066,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please."
105737,L570064,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all."
105738,L570063,u3129,m205,BETSY,"How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers."
105739,L570062,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, I hope he wins."
105740,L570061,u3129,m205,BETSY,Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
105741,L570060,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I see where Palantine got the nomination.
105742,L570059,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Hello, Betsy."
105743,L570058,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Hello, Travis."
105744,L569688,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Can I call you?
105745,L569687,u3129,m205,BETSY,Keep it.
105746,L569686,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What about the record?
105747,L569685,u3129,m205,BETSY,I'm getting a taxi.
105748,L569684,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,But... Betsy...
105749,L569683,u3129,m205,BETSY,"It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis."
105750,L569682,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Huh?
105751,L569681,u3129,m205,BETSY,"No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all."
105752,L569680,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
105753,L569679,u3129,m205,BETSY,"No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home."
105754,L569678,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good."
105755,L569676,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty..."
105756,L569675,u3129,m205,BETSY,My God!
105757,L569674,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Well... mostly...
105758,L569673,u3129,m205,BETSY,I mean porno movies.
105759,L569672,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,This is sort of high class...
105760,L569671,u3129,m205,BETSY,You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
105761,L569670,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, I don't follow movies too much..."
105762,L569669,u3129,m205,BETSY,These are not the kind of movies I go to.
105763,L569668,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What do you mean?
105764,L569667,u3129,m205,BETSY,I'm leaving.
105765,L569666,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Where are you going?
105766,L569665,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
105767,L569664,u3129,m205,BETSY,What's wrong?
105768,L569663,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Damn.
105769,L569662,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them."
105770,L569661,u3129,m205,BETSY,But this is a porno movie.
105771,L569660,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I bought a couple of tickets.
105772,L569659,u3129,m205,BETSY,What are you doing?
105773,L569658,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
105774,L569657,u3129,m205,BETSY,So you haven't heard this record yet?
105775,L569656,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
105776,L569655,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music."
105777,L569654,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK."
105778,L569653,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Travis, you haven't even played the record?"
105779,L569652,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"He'll, what else can I do with it all?"
105780,L569651,u3129,m205,BETSY,You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
105781,L569630,u3129,m205,BETSY,Kris Kristofferson.
105782,L569629,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
105783,L569628,u3129,m205,BETSY,The singer?
105784,L569627,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Oh. Who was that again?
105785,L569626,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction."
105786,L569625,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed."
105787,L569624,u3129,m205,BETSY,"That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said ""Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction""."
105788,L569623,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What?
105789,L569622,u3129,m205,BETSY,You know what you remind me of?
105790,L569621,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,It keeps ya busy.
105791,L569620,u3129,m205,BETSY,You must be rich.
105792,L569619,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night."
105793,L569618,u3129,m205,BETSY,You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
105794,L569617,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week."
105795,L569616,u3129,m205,BETSY,What hours do you work?
105796,L569615,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap."
105797,L569614,u3129,m205,BETSY,"That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?"
105798,L569613,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up."
105799,L569612,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night."
105800,L569611,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell."
105801,L569610,u3129,m205,BETSY,That would have been quite a coincidence.
105802,L569609,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up."
105803,L569608,u3129,m205,BETSY,The DMZ?
105804,L569607,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
105805,L569606,u3129,m205,BETSY,You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
105806,L569605,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
105807,L569604,u3129,m205,BETSY,Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
105808,L569603,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
105809,L569602,u3129,m205,BETSY,Huh?
105810,L569601,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I know. I could have picked you up.
105811,L569600,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis."
105812,L569598,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon."
105813,L569597,u3129,m205,BETSY,The moon?
105814,L569596,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out."
105815,L569595,u3129,m205,BETSY,That's really something.
105816,L569594,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him."
105817,L569593,u3129,m205,BETSY,What did you do?
105818,L569592,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said ""West 45th Street"" and conked out."
105819,L569591,u3129,m205,BETSY,Really?
105820,L569590,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once."
105821,L569589,u3129,m205,BETSY,What kind of people?
105822,L569588,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you."
105823,L569587,u3129,m205,BETSY,"After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while."
105824,L569586,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know."
105825,L569585,u3129,m205,BETSY,So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
105826,L569584,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much."
105827,L569583,u3129,m205,BETSY,Where do you live?
105828,L569582,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I can believe that.
105829,L569581,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before."
105830,L569580,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, ""One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"""
105831,L569579,u3129,m205,BETSY,"We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering."
105832,L569575,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Thank you, Travis."
105833,L569574,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,My name is Travis.
105834,L569573,u3129,m205,BETSY,Yes?
105835,L569572,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy..."
105836,L569571,u3129,m205,BETSY,All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
105837,L569570,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you."
105838,L569569,u3129,m205,BETSY,I don't know...
105839,L569568,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend."
105840,L569567,u3129,m205,BETSY,Why?
105841,L569566,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me."
105842,L569565,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?"
105843,L569564,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night."
105844,L569563,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Well, we're all working tonight."
105845,L569562,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you."
105846,L569561,u3129,m205,BETSY,"If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something."
105847,L569560,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker."
105848,L569559,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging."
105849,L569556,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Yes, mam."
105850,L569555,u3129,m205,BETSY,You want to canvass?
105851,L569554,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President."
105852,L569553,u3129,m205,BETSY,Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
105853,L569552,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Who mam?
105854,L569551,u3129,m205,BETSY,Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
105855,L569835,u3138,m205,TOM,Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
105856,L569834,u3129,m205,BETSY,"No, I don't think so.  That's someone else."
105857,L569832,u3138,m205,TOM,Just follow me.
105858,L569831,u3129,m205,BETSY,What is it? I'm busy.
105859,L569830,u3138,m205,TOM,"Betsy, come over here a moment."
105860,L569544,u3138,m205,TOM,Show me how he did that again.
105861,L569543,u3129,m205,BETSY,"No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure."
105862,L569542,u3138,m205,TOM,"I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --"
105863,L569541,u3129,m205,BETSY,"No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point."
105864,L569540,u3138,m205,TOM,"With the other hand, right?"
105865,L569539,u3129,m205,BETSY,"First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it."
105866,L569538,u3138,m205,TOM,"I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief."
105867,L569537,u3129,m205,BETSY,Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
105868,L569536,u3138,m205,TOM,"Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic."
105869,L569535,u3129,m205,BETSY,"As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them."
105870,L569534,u3138,m205,TOM,"Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something."
105871,L569533,u3129,m205,BETSY,"He's Black, OK?"
105872,L569532,u3138,m205,TOM,You sure he's not Italian?
105873,L569531,u3129,m205,BETSY,"No, why?"
105874,L569530,u3138,m205,TOM,Is he Italian?
105875,L569529,u3129,m205,BETSY,He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
105876,L569528,u3138,m205,TOM,"Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos..."
105877,L569527,u3129,m205,BETSY,No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
105878,L569526,u3138,m205,TOM,I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
105879,L569525,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Oh, are you all right?"
105880,L569524,u3138,m205,TOM,Ouch!
105881,L569523,u3129,m205,BETSY,This I gotta see.
105882,L569522,u3138,m205,TOM,"This is gotta be a game, right?"
105883,L569521,u3129,m205,BETSY,Try holding the match like this.
105884,L569466,u3129,m205,BETSY,I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
105885,L569465,u3138,m205,TOM,How long has he been there?
105886,L569464,u3129,m205,BETSY,That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
105887,L569463,u3138,m205,TOM,What taxi driver?
105888,L569462,u3129,m205,BETSY,Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
105889,L569461,u3138,m205,TOM,"No, why?"
105890,L569460,u3129,m205,BETSY,Have you been noticing anything strange?
105891,L569459,u3138,m205,TOM,Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
105892,L569458,u3129,m205,BETSY,That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
105893,L569457,u3138,m205,TOM,"Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?"
105894,L569456,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it."
105895,L569455,u3138,m205,TOM,With who?
105896,L569454,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere."
105897,L569453,u3138,m205,TOM,"Kidding around... you know, fun."
105898,L569452,u3129,m205,BETSY,Just what?
105899,L569451,u3138,m205,TOM,"No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just..."
105900,L569450,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,"
105901,L569449,u3138,m205,TOM,More people watch it.
105902,L569448,u3129,m205,BETSY,Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
105903,L569447,u3138,m205,TOM,"Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues."
105904,L569446,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Oh, Tom, please."
105905,L569445,u3138,m205,TOM,"Just didn't get around to it, huh?"
105906,L569444,u3129,m205,BETSY,"No, I didn't forget ""sexy""."
105907,L569443,u3138,m205,TOM,"You forgot ""sexy""."
105908,L569442,u3129,m205,BETSY,"First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man."
105909,L569441,u3138,m205,TOM,I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
105910,L569440,u3129,m205,BETSY,Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
105911,L569439,u3138,m205,TOM,"The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?"
105912,L569438,u3129,m205,BETSY,"Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases."
105913,L569434,u3130,m205,CONCESSION GIRL,That's a dollar forty-seven.
105914,L569433,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,That's fine.
105915,L569432,u3130,m205,CONCESSION GIRL,We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
105916,L569431,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last."
105917,L569430,u3130,m205,CONCESSION GIRL,Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
105918,L569429,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"No, I'm serious, really..."
105919,L569428,u3130,m205,CONCESSION GIRL,"Awh, come off it, Pal."
105920,L569427,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What is your name? My name is Travis.
105921,L569785,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"And the kid says, ""Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin."" McCall says, ""What can I tell you?"""
105922,L569784,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Fuckin' One-Ball.
105923,L569781,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, ""Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?"
105924,L569780,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,One-Ball McCall?
105925,L569779,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher..."
105926,L569520,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me."
105927,L569519,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?"
105928,L569518,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em."
105929,L569517,u3140,m205,WIZARD,I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
105930,L569516,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,For a fee.
105931,L569515,u3140,m205,WIZARD,For a fee.
105932,L569514,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch."
105933,L569513,u3140,m205,WIZARD,The cops and company raise hell they find out.
105934,L569512,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around."
105935,L569506,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is."
105936,L569505,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"You run all over town, don't you, Travis?"
105937,L569498,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
105938,L569497,u3140,m205,WIZARD,We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
105939,L569496,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
105940,L569494,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,A real skunk.
105941,L569493,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk."
105942,L569492,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,And what happened?
105943,L569491,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Well, I said, ""Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."""
105944,L569490,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,You said that?
105945,L569489,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said ""Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."""
105946,L569486,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?"
105947,L569485,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Yeah.
105948,L569484,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?"
105949,L569483,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,What did you do?
105950,L569482,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still."
105951,L569481,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Could you see anything?
105952,L569480,u3140,m205,WIZARD,Yeah.
105953,L569479,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,No.
105954,L569478,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!"
105955,L569477,u3140,m205,WIZARD,Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
105956,L569476,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,"
105957,L569473,u3140,m205,WIZARD,The kind with a brush.
105958,L569472,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it."
105959,L569471,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge..."
105960,L569723,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis."
105961,L569722,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,20 bucks?
105962,L569511,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Nah.  I suppose not.
105963,L569510,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,You carry a piece? You need one?
105964,L569509,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I have.
105965,L569508,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,"I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?"
105966,L569507,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Huh?
105967,L569504,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,In the jungle. 122nd.
105968,L569503,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Where.
105969,L569502,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off."
105970,L569501,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Stick up?
105971,L569488,u3131,m205,DOUGH-BOY,Stick up?
105972,L569487,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
105973,L570019,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,My work may take me out of New York.
105974,L570018,u3132,m205,IRIS,What do you mean?
105975,L570017,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
105976,L570016,u3132,m205,IRIS,You don't have to.
105977,L570015,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
105978,L570014,u3132,m205,IRIS,I sure hate to go alone...
105979,L570013,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I can't. Otherwise, I would."
105980,L570012,u3132,m205,IRIS,Sure you don't want to come with me?
105981,L570011,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it."
105982,L570010,u3132,m205,IRIS,Do you really think I should go to the commune?
105983,L570009,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it."
105984,L570008,u3132,m205,IRIS,"You're not much with girls, are you?"
105985,L570007,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that."
105986,L570006,u3132,m205,IRIS,God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
105987,L570005,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em."
105988,L570004,u3132,m205,IRIS,How?
105989,L570003,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
105990,L570002,u3132,m205,IRIS,"Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once."
105991,L570001,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Cops don't do nothin.
105992,L570000,u3132,m205,IRIS,What should I do? Call the cops?
105993,L569999,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,You just gonna leave 'em?
105994,L569998,u3132,m205,IRIS,Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
105995,L569997,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
105996,L569996,u3132,m205,IRIS,"God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me."
105997,L569995,u3132,m205,IRIS,Yeah.
105998,L569994,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Do I look like a narc?
105999,L569993,u3132,m205,IRIS,You a narc?
106000,L569992,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
106001,L569991,u3132,m205,IRIS,What's so important?
106002,L569990,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
106003,L569989,u3132,m205,IRIS,Why?
106004,L569988,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Besides, I've got to stay here."
106005,L569987,u3132,m205,IRIS,You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
106006,L569986,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I... I don't get along with people like that.
106007,L569985,u3132,m205,IRIS,Why not?
106008,L569984,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Me? I could never go to a place like that.
106009,L569983,u3132,m205,IRIS,Why don't you come to a commune with me?
106010,L569982,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me."
106011,L569981,u3132,m205,IRIS,"Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here."
106012,L569980,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
106013,L569979,u3132,m205,IRIS,What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
106014,L569978,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,He shoots dope too.
106015,L569977,u3132,m205,IRIS,I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
106016,L569976,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,He looks like a killer.
106017,L569975,u3132,m205,IRIS,I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
106018,L569974,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Huh?
106019,L569973,u3132,m205,IRIS,He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
106020,L569972,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"That fella ""Sport"" looks like a killer to me."
106021,L569971,u3132,m205,IRIS,Who's a killer?
106022,L569970,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
106023,L569969,u3132,m205,IRIS,"God, you are square."
106024,L569967,u3132,m205,IRIS,Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
106025,L569966,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
106026,L569965,u3132,m205,IRIS,Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
106027,L569964,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place."
106028,L569963,u3132,m205,IRIS,Pittsburgh.
106029,L569962,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Where?
106030,L569960,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Where is home?
106031,L569959,u3132,m205,IRIS,...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
106032,L569939,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then."
106033,L569938,u3132,m205,IRIS,"Well, you want to or not?"
106034,L569937,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
106035,L569936,u3132,m205,IRIS,Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
106036,L569935,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do."
106037,L569934,u3132,m205,IRIS,That's not hard to do.
106038,L569933,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Can I see you again?
106039,L569932,u3132,m205,IRIS,"I understand, mister. It means something, really."
106040,L569931,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, I tried."
106041,L569930,u3132,m205,IRIS,"I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself."
106042,L569929,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,But that one night?
106043,L569928,u3132,m205,IRIS,I can leave anytime I want.
106044,L569927,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Don't you want to go?
106045,L569926,u3132,m205,IRIS,"I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away."
106046,L569925,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Do you understand why I came here?
106047,L569923,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Don't you understand anything?
106048,L569922,u3132,m205,IRIS,You can do it in my mouth.
106049,L569921,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
106050,L569918,u3132,m205,IRIS,Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
106051,L569917,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Listen...
106052,L569916,u3132,m205,IRIS,"Oh, come off it, man."
106053,L569915,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Do they drug you?
106054,L569914,u3132,m205,IRIS,I musta been stoned.
106055,L569913,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
106056,L569912,u3132,m205,IRIS,Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
106057,L569911,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
106058,L569910,u3132,m205,IRIS,You want to make it like this?
106059,L569909,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
106060,L569908,u3132,m205,IRIS,"We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?"
106061,L569907,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
106062,L569906,u3132,m205,IRIS,I don't remember.
106063,L569905,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
106064,L569904,u3132,m205,IRIS,No.
106065,L569903,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
106066,L569902,u3132,m205,IRIS,Why? Who are you?
106067,L569900,u3132,m205,IRIS,That's what you think.
106068,L569899,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,That's a nice name.
106069,L569898,u3132,m205,IRIS,Iris.
106070,L569897,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What's your real name?
106071,L569896,u3132,m205,IRIS,I don't like my real name.
106072,L569895,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What's your real name?
106073,L569894,u3132,m205,IRIS,It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
106074,L569893,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,That ain't much of a name.
106075,L569892,u3132,m205,IRIS,Easy.
106076,L569891,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,What's your name?
106077,L569890,u3132,m205,IRIS,"It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up."
106078,L569889,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Yeah. From the likes of them.
106079,L569888,u3132,m205,IRIS,A girl needs protection.
106080,L569887,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Why you hang around with them greasers?
106081,L569868,u3132,m205,IRIS,All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
106082,L569867,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Well... I guess so.
106083,L569866,u3132,m205,IRIS,You looking for some action?
106084,L569865,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Hello.
106085,L569411,u3133,m205,MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT,"Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!"
106086,L569410,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,No.
106087,L569409,u3133,m205,MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT,"There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know."
106088,L569408,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Have you tried the telephone?
106089,L569407,u3133,m205,MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT,"The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?"
106090,L569406,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
106091,L569405,u3133,m205,MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT,Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
106092,L569404,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Why should it be grounded?
106093,L569650,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir."
106094,L569649,u3134,m205,PALANTINE,"Nice talking to you, Travis."
106095,L569648,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Damn straight.
106096,L569647,u3134,m205,PALANTINE,"I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes."
106097,L569646,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out."
106098,L569645,u3134,m205,PALANTINE,There must be something...
106099,L569644,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much."
106100,L569643,u3134,m205,PALANTINE,"Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?"
106101,L569641,u3134,m205,PALANTINE,"I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors."
106102,L569640,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy."
106103,L569639,u3134,m205,PALANTINE,"Why, thank you Travis."
106104,L569638,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you."
106105,L569637,u3134,m205,PALANTINE,Yes I am.
106106,L569636,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?"
106107,L569399,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Yes, Sir."

106110,L569396,u3135,m205,PERSONNEL OFFICER,"Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?"
106111,L569395,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,So I hear.

106148,L569846,u3136,m205,SECRET SERVICE MAN,Is that so?

106153,L569841,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
106154,L569840,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there."

106156,L569838,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.

106188,L569823,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard."
106189,L569822,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in."
106190,L569821,u3140,m205,WIZARD,"Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am."
106191,L569820,u3139,m205,TRAVIS,"Like do anything, you know."

106216,L577057,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.

106236,L577397,u3144,m206,SANCHEZ,"You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed."
106237,L577396,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Thank you.
106238,L577209,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
106239,L577208,u3144,m206,SANCHEZ,Maybe.  Not really.
106240,L577206,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.

106242,L577801,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,What's that?  Mason?
106243,L577800,u3143,m206,MASON,"St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow."
106244,L577798,u3143,m206,MASON,Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
106245,L577797,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,God's speed.
106246,L577795,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,"All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back."
106247,L577794,u3143,m206,MASON,"I'm not a fool, Billy."
106248,L577793,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,You knew?  All this time?
106249,L577792,u3143,m206,MASON,"Womack ripped it up, right?"
106250,L577791,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,"Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?"
106251,L577728,u3143,m206,MASON,Partners.
106252,L577727,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Partners?
106253,L577673,u3143,m206,MASON,An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
106254,L577672,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,"I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break."
106255,L577671,u3143,m206,MASON,"Surprise, surprise."
106256,L577668,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,"The cell, Mason."
106257,L577667,u3143,m206,MASON,"You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ...."
106258,L577663,u3143,m206,MASON,It's about time.
106259,L577662,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Mason.  Mason?
106260,L577627,u3143,m206,MASON,"Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them."
106261,L577626,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Wait.
106262,L577623,u3143,m206,MASON,Now they only have three rockets left.
106263,L577622,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,What are you doing?
106264,L577620,u3143,m206,MASON,I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
106265,L577619,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,"What, vou?"
106266,L577618,u3143,m206,MASON,Wrong.
106267,L577617,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,I'll go.
106268,L577599,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,It's all I could think of.
106269,L577598,u3143,m206,MASON,Limp dick?
106270,L577558,u3143,m206,MASON,No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
106271,L577557,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
106272,L577515,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Wait.  Where're you going?
106273,L577514,u3143,m206,MASON,For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
106274,L577513,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
106275,L577428,u3143,m206,MASON,For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
106276,L577427,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Motor oil?
106277,L577312,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,"Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go."
106278,L577311,u3143,m206,MASON,John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
106279,L577237,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Yes.  You'll be outside.
106280,L577236,u3143,m206,MASON,You suppose?
106281,L577235,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,Well yes I suppose ...
106282,L577234,u3143,m206,MASON,"During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?"
106283,L577233,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,I don't understand....
106284,L577226,u3143,m206,MASON,Tell me what you really do.
106285,L577225,u3142,m206,GOODSPEED,I'm a field agent.
106286,L577224,u3143,m206,MASON,"What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed."
106287,L588515,u3145,m207,ADELE,"And  I love you, Pete!"
106288,L588514,u3157,m207,PETE,"Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!"
106289,L588513,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again..."
106290,L588512,u3157,m207,PETE,I see you got the telegram.
106291,L588447,u3157,m207,PETE,"Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you."
106292,L588446,u3145,m207,ADELE,Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
106293,L588369,u3157,m207,PETE,Okay.  What's the second thing?
106294,L588368,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while."
106295,L588367,u3157,m207,PETE,"Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this."
106296,L588366,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning."
106297,L588363,u3157,m207,PETE,Damn...
106298,L588362,u3145,m207,ADELE,Did you bring along something to read?
106299,L588360,u3157,m207,PETE,"Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers..."
106300,L588359,u3145,m207,ADELE,And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
106301,L588358,u3157,m207,PETE,I wish you were coming with me.
106302,L588357,u3145,m207,ADELE,"You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that."
106303,L588356,u3157,m207,PETE,Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
106304,L588355,u3145,m207,ADELE,You've got everything?
106305,L588308,u3145,m207,ADELE,Whatever happens.
106306,L588307,u3157,m207,PETE,You'll stand by me?
106307,L588306,u3145,m207,ADELE,"I am, too."
106308,L588305,u3157,m207,PETE,"What about you, Delly?"
106309,L588304,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side."
106310,L588303,u3157,m207,PETE,"Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want ""suspected communists"" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, ""Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"""
106311,L588302,u3145,m207,ADELE,"But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?"
106312,L588301,u3157,m207,PETE,"The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them."
106313,L588300,u3145,m207,ADELE,I believe you.
106314,L588298,u3157,m207,PETE,"Thanks, I like it.  I think."
106315,L588297,u3145,m207,ADELE,"You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name."
106316,L588296,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much."
106317,L588295,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Oh, yes.  Yes, he was."
106318,L588294,u3157,m207,PETE,"This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?"
106319,L588293,u3157,m207,PETE,Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
106320,L588292,u3145,m207,ADELE,I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
106321,L588291,u3157,m207,PETE,Hi.
106322,L588290,u3145,m207,ADELE,Hi.
106323,L588074,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"I had it, a minute ago..."
106324,L588073,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working."
106325,L588057,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Honey, I... I can't... it's the..."
106326,L588056,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down."
106327,L587903,u3152,m207,LARDNER,It's possible.
106328,L587902,u3145,m207,ADELE,"You mean,  me?"
106329,L587901,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst."
106330,L587900,u3145,m207,ADELE,... including me.  Right?
106331,L587899,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone..."
106332,L587898,u3145,m207,ADELE,Dad...
106333,L587897,u3152,m207,LARDNER,Well...
106334,L587896,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?"
106335,L587895,u3152,m207,LARDNER,That always used to work.
106336,L587894,u3145,m207,ADELE,I think  it's worse  now.
106337,L587887,u3145,m207,ADELE,"No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  ""Your  honor, I  object!"""
106338,L587886,u3152,m207,LARDNER,That's my girl!  Did you...?
106339,L587885,u3145,m207,ADELE,Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
106340,L587884,u3152,m207,LARDNER,How'd it go?
106341,L587883,u3152,m207,LARDNER,Delly?  In here.
106342,L587882,u3145,m207,ADELE,Dad?
106343,L588264,u3145,m207,ADELE,No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
106344,L588263,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Delly, shhhhhh..."
106345,L588258,u3154,m207,LUKE,Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
106346,L588257,u3145,m207,ADELE,I see...
106347,L588256,u3154,m207,LUKE,Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
106348,L588255,u3145,m207,ADELE,What... do you remember?
106349,L588123,u3154,m207,LUKE,Guess I must've learned.
106350,L588122,u3145,m207,ADELE,It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
106351,L588121,u3154,m207,LUKE,Thanks.
106352,L588120,u3145,m207,ADELE,Your dancing's very good.
106353,L588119,u3154,m207,LUKE,That's... pretty frightening.
106354,L588118,u3145,m207,ADELE,Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
106355,L588117,u3154,m207,LUKE,"How do you tell those two apart, anyway?"
106356,L588104,u3145,m207,ADELE,Oh.  Okay.
106357,L588103,u3154,m207,LUKE,Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
106358,L588102,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Now, did you remember that, or..."
106359,L588101,u3154,m207,LUKE,No kidding.
106360,L588100,u3145,m207,ADELE,Exactly.  And he got good.
106361,L588099,u3154,m207,LUKE,"... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on."
106362,L588098,u3145,m207,ADELE,"You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet..."
106363,L588097,u3154,m207,LUKE,Huh.  That was nice of me.
106364,L588096,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer."
106365,L588095,u3154,m207,LUKE,My what?
106366,L588094,u3145,m207,ADELE,"No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends."
106367,L588093,u3154,m207,LUKE,They're not bad.
106368,L588092,u3154,m207,LUKE,Oh.
106369,L588091,u3145,m207,ADELE,You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
106370,L588090,u3154,m207,LUKE,I don't smoke?
106371,L588089,u3145,m207,ADELE,When did you start smoking?
106372,L588088,u3154,m207,LUKE,Have you got a cigarette?
106373,L588087,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Well, there's got to be a way..."
106374,L588086,u3154,m207,LUKE,A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
106375,L588085,u3145,m207,ADELE,What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
106376,L588084,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around."
106377,L588083,u3145,m207,ADELE,Nine hundred...
106378,L588082,u3154,m207,LUKE,"It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly."
106379,L588081,u3145,m207,ADELE,"You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening..."
106380,L588080,u3154,m207,LUKE,Oh.
106381,L588079,u3145,m207,ADELE,"We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday."
106382,L588078,u3154,m207,LUKE,What?
106383,L588077,u3145,m207,ADELE,This is strange.  Do you feel it?
106384,L588068,u3145,m207,ADELE,"... and It's just... well, deja vu."
106385,L588067,u3154,m207,LUKE,Oh...
106386,L588066,u3145,m207,ADELE,No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
106387,L588000,u3145,m207,ADELE,Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
106388,L587999,u3154,m207,LUKE,Were we going to get married?
106389,L587998,u3145,m207,ADELE,I'm  fine.  Really.
106390,L587997,u3154,m207,LUKE,Do you have the...
106391,L587996,u3145,m207,ADELE,Nothing.
106392,L587995,u3154,m207,LUKE,What was that?
106393,L587994,u3145,m207,ADELE,Yes.  Hic!
106394,L587993,u3154,m207,LUKE,We were in love... weren't we?
106395,L587992,u3145,m207,ADELE,Yeah...
106396,L587991,u3154,m207,LUKE,"No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along."
106397,L587990,u3145,m207,ADELE,"No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?"
106398,L587989,u3154,m207,LUKE,I'm sorry.
106399,L587988,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now."
106400,L587987,u3154,m207,LUKE,You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
106401,L587985,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that."
106402,L587984,u3154,m207,LUKE,What did... what did I want to be?
106403,L587983,u3145,m207,ADELE,"You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl."
106404,L587982,u3154,m207,LUKE,Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
106405,L587981,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  ""A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?""  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact."
106406,L587980,u3154,m207,LUKE,Whoa.
106407,L587979,u3145,m207,ADELE,And why not?
106408,L587978,u3154,m207,LUKE,"So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?"
106409,L587977,u3145,m207,ADELE,"After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here."
106410,L587976,u3154,m207,LUKE,"It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it."
106411,L587975,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Right here.  ""Albert Lucas Trumbo."" And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them."
106412,L587973,u3145,m207,ADELE,Through the door.  It comes apart.
106413,L587972,u3154,m207,LUKE,How'd they get it inside?
106414,L587971,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here."
106415,L587969,u3145,m207,ADELE,Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
106416,L587968,u3154,m207,LUKE,Why me?
106417,L587967,u3145,m207,ADELE,You first.
106418,L587966,u3145,m207,ADELE,You must not remember anything. Come on.
106419,L587965,u3154,m207,LUKE,City hall?
106420,L587963,u3154,m207,LUKE,Well... where can we go?
106421,L587962,u3145,m207,ADELE,Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
106422,L587956,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome."
106423,L587955,u3145,m207,ADELE,"You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere."
106424,L587954,u3154,m207,LUKE,I did?  Huh!
106425,L587953,u3145,m207,ADELE,"Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight."
106426,L587952,u3154,m207,LUKE,I do?
106427,L587951,u3145,m207,ADELE,You look... different.
106428,L587950,u3154,m207,LUKE,Me too.
106429,L587949,u3145,m207,ADELE,"No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time."
106430,L587948,u3154,m207,LUKE,What.
106431,L587944,u3154,m207,LUKE,I've seen you before.  Your picture...
106432,L587943,u3145,m207,ADELE,Do you... remember me?
106433,L588437,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Well, then, as what did you go?"
106434,L588436,u3157,m207,PETE,"That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member."
106435,L588435,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party."
106436,L588434,u3157,m207,PETE,I'm not refuting anything.
106437,L588433,u3146,m207,CLYDE,Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
106438,L588432,u3157,m207,PETE,"No, sir."
106439,L588431,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?"
106440,L588427,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive..."
106441,L588426,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?"
106442,L588425,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?"
106443,L588422,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom..."
106444,L588421,u3146,m207,CLYDE,Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
106445,L588420,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her."
106446,L588419,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"We see it.  For the record, it reads ""Lucille Angstrom.""  What's the point of this?"
106447,L588418,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there."
106448,L588417,u3146,m207,CLYDE,Start with what you knew then.
106449,L588416,u3157,m207,PETE,"Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?"
106450,L588415,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the ""Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"""
106451,L588414,u3157,m207,PETE,Yes it does.
106452,L588413,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?"
106453,L588412,u3157,m207,PETE,"Yes... yes, I do."
106454,L588411,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the ""Bread Instead of Bullets Club"" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?"
106455,L588410,u3157,m207,PETE,"Mr. Clyde, I remember everything."
106456,L588409,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently ""blotted out"" as a result of your ""accident."""
106457,L588408,u3157,m207,PETE,"Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?"
106458,L588405,u3146,m207,CLYDE,And what is the state of your memory now?
106459,L588404,u3157,m207,PETE,Yes.
106460,L588403,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... ""accident,"" Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this ""accident"" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?"
106461,L588402,u3157,m207,PETE,"Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there."
106462,L588401,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called ""The Bijou,"" is that also true?"
106463,L588400,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right."
106464,L588399,u3157,m207,PETE,"Yes, sir."
106465,L588398,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?"
106466,L588397,u3157,m207,PETE,Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
106467,L588396,u3146,m207,CLYDE,Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
106468,L588395,u3157,m207,PETE,Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
106469,L588394,u3146,m207,CLYDE,"Mr. Appleton, do you know an ""Albert Lucas Trumbo?"""
106470,L588393,u3157,m207,PETE,"Sir, that is true."
106471,L588458,u3147,m207,DOYLE,"Mr. Appleton, you will..."
106472,L588457,u3157,m207,PETE,"Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it."
106473,L588456,u3147,m207,DOYLE,"Go ahead, son."
106474,L588455,u3157,m207,PETE,I... I need a drink of water.
106475,L588454,u3147,m207,DOYLE,Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
106476,L588443,u3157,m207,PETE,"I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail."
106477,L588442,u3147,m207,DOYLE,"Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath."
106478,L588439,u3147,m207,DOYLE,"The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth."
106479,L588438,u3157,m207,PETE,I'm a little hesitant to say.
106480,L588386,u3157,m207,PETE,Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
106481,L588385,u3147,m207,DOYLE,Yes.  A prepared statement.
106482,L588384,u3157,m207,PETE,A statement?
106483,L588383,u3147,m207,DOYLE,"Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?"
106484,L588382,u3157,m207,PETE,"I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman."
106485,L588381,u3147,m207,DOYLE,"The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?"
106486,L588380,u3157,m207,PETE,"Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California."
106487,L588379,u3147,m207,DOYLE,Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
106488,L588378,u3157,m207,PETE,I do.
106489,L588377,u3147,m207,DOYLE,"Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?"
106490,L587810,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke."
106491,L587809,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Thanks for the lift, Cecil."
106492,L587808,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Well, son, you're home!"
106493,L587807,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,Here we are.
106494,L587789,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"Ben, when's Delly due back?"
106495,L587788,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Only one in town.  Get in, son."
106496,L587757,u3150,m207,HARRY,Listen to me!  The young man in there...
106497,L587756,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?"
106498,L587755,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there..."
106499,L587791,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
106500,L587790,u3152,m207,LARDNER,Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
106501,L587782,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!"
106502,L587781,u3152,m207,LARDNER,Mother o'god...
106503,L587779,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,Shhhhhh.
106504,L587778,u3152,m207,LARDNER,Are you saying that he's...
106505,L587776,u3152,m207,LARDNER,By all means.
106506,L587775,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory."
106507,L587763,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?"
106508,L587762,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?"
106509,L587761,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"No wallet, huh?"
106510,L588276,u3157,m207,PETE,I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
106511,L588275,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers..."
106512,L587785,u3157,m207,PETE,The Bijou?
106513,L587784,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou."
106514,L587774,u3157,m207,PETE,I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
106515,L587773,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,Or the Bijou.  Either one.
106516,L587772,u3157,m207,PETE,"""It's a Wonderful Life?"""
106517,L587771,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?"
106518,L587770,u3157,m207,PETE,"""It's a Wonderful Life."""
106519,L587769,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,What's that?
106520,L587768,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well, this place sorta reminds me of something."
106521,L587767,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,But what?
106522,L587766,u3157,m207,PETE,No.  But...
106523,L587765,u3148,m207,ELDRIDGE,"You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?"
106524,L587764,u3157,m207,PETE,Yes.
106525,L588185,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt..."
106526,L588184,u3149,m207,FITTS,So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
106527,L588153,u3149,m207,FITTS,You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
106528,L588152,u3154,m207,LUKE,A super market.  Huh.
106529,L588151,u3149,m207,FITTS,The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
106530,L588150,u3154,m207,LUKE,"That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?"
106531,L588149,u3149,m207,FITTS,"Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land."
106532,L588148,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Well, he loves the place.  It's his home."
106533,L588147,u3149,m207,FITTS,"I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought."
106534,L588146,u3154,m207,LUKE,We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
106535,L588145,u3149,m207,FITTS,And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
106536,L588144,u3154,m207,LUKE,Thanks.
106537,L588143,u3149,m207,FITTS,"Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back."
106538,L588142,u3154,m207,LUKE,Good to meet you.  Again.
106539,L588141,u3149,m207,FITTS,"Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town."
106540,L588247,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son."
106541,L588246,u3154,m207,LUKE,"You're not going anywhere, Harry."
106542,L588245,u3150,m207,HARRY,"I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?"
106543,L588244,u3150,m207,HARRY,Vultures...
106544,L588243,u3154,m207,LUKE,A few.
106545,L588242,u3150,m207,HARRY,Anybody take it?
106546,L588241,u3154,m207,LUKE,I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
106547,L588240,u3150,m207,HARRY,Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
106548,L588239,u3154,m207,LUKE,Did I what?
106549,L588238,u3150,m207,HARRY,Did you... did you...
106550,L588237,u3154,m207,LUKE,I'm here.
106551,L588231,u3154,m207,LUKE,"I know, I know... keep still."
106552,L588230,u3150,m207,HARRY,The film broke...
106553,L588229,u3154,m207,LUKE,Jesus...
106554,L588165,u3154,m207,LUKE,Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
106555,L588164,u3150,m207,HARRY,Luke... what time is it?
106556,L588162,u3150,m207,HARRY,"You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me ""Dad."""
106557,L588161,u3154,m207,LUKE,... what?
106558,L588160,u3150,m207,HARRY,Ha!
106559,L588159,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Dad, I..."
106560,L588158,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact..."
106561,L588157,u3154,m207,LUKE,Yes.
106562,L588156,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Beautiful, wasn't it?"
106563,L588134,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Oh, no, I..."
106564,L588133,u3154,m207,LUKE,Why don't you two get out there and dance?
106565,L588050,u3150,m207,HARRY,They're...
106566,L588049,u3154,m207,LUKE,"And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?"
106567,L588046,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up."
106568,L588045,u3150,m207,HARRY,Yes?
106569,L588044,u3154,m207,LUKE,Well...
106570,L587960,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly."
106571,L587959,u3154,m207,LUKE,You bet.
106572,L587958,u3150,m207,HARRY,"You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess."
106573,L587957,u3154,m207,LUKE,"I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up."
106574,L587924,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry."
106575,L587923,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him ""Cueball."""
106576,L587911,u3154,m207,LUKE,... Ernie.
106577,L587910,u3150,m207,HARRY,Ernie.
106578,L587881,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to."
106579,L587880,u3154,m207,LUKE,But I...
106580,L587870,u3150,m207,HARRY,"I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you..."
106581,L587869,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Yeah, I know, but poultry...?"
106582,L587868,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures."
106583,L587867,u3154,m207,LUKE,"""one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"""
106584,L587866,u3150,m207,HARRY,Yes?
106585,L587865,u3154,m207,LUKE,"""Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."""
106586,L587864,u3150,m207,HARRY,Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
106587,L587863,u3154,m207,LUKE,"""February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"""
106588,L587862,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here."
106589,L587861,u3150,m207,HARRY,"No, your mother did, then I did after she passed."
106590,L587860,u3154,m207,LUKE,Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
106591,L587849,u3154,m207,LUKE,"You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has."
106592,L587848,u3150,m207,HARRY,"I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too."
106593,L587837,u3150,m207,HARRY,Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
106594,L587836,u3154,m207,LUKE,Oh.  What... what time is it?
106595,L587835,u3150,m207,HARRY,This is the staff of the Bijou.
106596,L587834,u3154,m207,LUKE,Who... are they?
106597,L587833,u3150,m207,HARRY,They couldn't wait to see you.
106598,L587826,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home."
106599,L587825,u3154,m207,LUKE,Mother.  She's beautiful.
106600,L587824,u3150,m207,HARRY,"That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul."
106601,L587821,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live."
106602,L587820,u3154,m207,LUKE,Didn't you have any help?
106603,L587819,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this ""television"" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to."
106604,L587818,u3154,m207,LUKE,Why?
106605,L587817,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight."
106606,L587816,u3154,m207,LUKE,Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
106607,L587815,u3154,m207,LUKE,Ah.
106608,L587814,u3150,m207,HARRY,We've been closed for a while.
106609,L587813,u3154,m207,LUKE,Can't wait.
106610,L587812,u3150,m207,HARRY,Wait'll you see the inside!
106611,L587805,u3154,m207,LUKE,Nine and-a-half years...
106612,L587804,u3150,m207,HARRY,Nine and-a-half years ago.
106613,L587803,u3150,m207,HARRY,You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
106614,L587802,u3154,m207,LUKE,When did I leave?
106615,L587801,u3150,m207,HARRY,You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
106616,L587798,u3154,m207,LUKE,Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
106617,L587797,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been ""Luke"" since you were a baby."
106618,L587796,u3154,m207,LUKE,And... what's my name again?
106619,L587795,u3150,m207,HARRY,"Harry, son.  Harry."
106620,L587794,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?"
106621,L587662,u3151,m207,JERRY,Pete...
106622,L587661,u3157,m207,PETE,"'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer."
106623,L587660,u3157,m207,PETE,I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
106624,L587659,u3151,m207,JERRY,Then I'll call you a cab.
106625,L587658,u3157,m207,PETE,Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
106626,L587657,u3151,m207,JERRY,"I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her."
106627,L587656,u3157,m207,PETE,"Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist."
106628,L587655,u3151,m207,JERRY,"Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up."
106629,L587654,u3157,m207,PETE,Sandra Sinclair.
106630,L587653,u3151,m207,JERRY,"Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?"
106631,L587652,u3157,m207,PETE,"This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike."
106632,L587651,u3151,m207,JERRY,"Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?"
106633,L587650,u3157,m207,PETE,"You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?"
106634,L587649,u3151,m207,JERRY,You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
106635,L587648,u3157,m207,PETE,Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
106636,L587647,u3151,m207,JERRY,"Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him."
106637,L587646,u3157,m207,PETE,Zackly.
106638,L587645,u3151,m207,JERRY,The G-man?
106639,L587644,u3157,m207,PETE,You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
106640,L587643,u3151,m207,JERRY,What.
106641,L587642,u3157,m207,PETE,"Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something."
106642,L587641,u3157,m207,PETE,"Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave."
106643,L587640,u3151,m207,JERRY,Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
106644,L587787,u3157,m207,PETE,We live in a theater?
106645,L587786,u3152,m207,LARDNER,That's where you live.
106646,L587754,u3157,m207,PETE,Wish I could say the same thing.
106647,L587753,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me."
106648,L587752,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are..."
106649,L587751,u3157,m207,PETE,She's very pretty.
106650,L587750,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does."
106651,L587748,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Well, at least you remember ""Moby Dick."""
106652,L587747,u3157,m207,PETE,Call me... Ishmael?
106653,L587746,u3152,m207,LARDNER,What is it?
106654,L587745,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all."
106655,L587744,u3157,m207,PETE,"I... no, I... I just can't..."
106656,L587743,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?"
106657,L587742,u3157,m207,PETE,It's possible.  I just don't remember.
106658,L587741,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before."
106659,L587740,u3157,m207,PETE,Thanks.
106660,L587739,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Here, one of mine."
106661,L587738,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean."
106662,L587737,u3157,m207,PETE,I guess I did.
106663,L587736,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in."
106664,L587735,u3157,m207,PETE,I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
106665,L587734,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Been drinkin' a bit, have we?"
106666,L587733,u3157,m207,PETE,"No, sir."
106667,L587732,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Any idea how you got here, son?"
106668,L588235,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry."
106669,L588234,u3154,m207,LUKE,Can we get him to the hospital?
106670,L588233,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down."
106671,L588072,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"No, I'm not much of a dancer."
106672,L588071,u3154,m207,LUKE,Aren't you coming?
106673,L588070,u3152,m207,LARDNER,You kids off to the dance?
106674,L588063,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big."
106675,L588062,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it..."
106676,L588061,u3154,m207,LUKE,What's wrong?
106677,L588060,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Evening, Doctor Lardner."
106678,L588059,u3152,m207,LARDNER,"Evening, Luke."
106679,L588030,u3161,m207,SUPER,"Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave."
106680,L588029,u3153,m207,LEO,Take a hike.  Am-scray.
106681,L588028,u3161,m207,SUPER,Huh?
106682,L588027,u3153,m207,LEO,"Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone."
106683,L588026,u3161,m207,SUPER,Thirty a month.
106684,L588025,u3153,m207,LEO,What's his rent?
106685,L588024,u3161,m207,SUPER,"Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?"
106686,L588023,u3153,m207,LEO,Wouldn't blame him if he was.
106687,L588022,u3161,m207,SUPER,You think he's drunk somewhere?
106688,L588021,u3161,m207,SUPER,"Hey, it's the best way to tell."
106689,L588020,u3153,m207,LEO,Jesus.
106690,L588019,u3161,m207,SUPER,Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
106691,L588018,u3153,m207,LEO,You smell gas?
106692,L588498,u3153,m207,LEO,Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
106693,L588497,u3157,m207,PETE,Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
106694,L588496,u3153,m207,LEO,"So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself."
106695,L588495,u3157,m207,PETE,"Oh god, oh, god, no, I..."
106696,L588494,u3153,m207,LEO,"You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for ""Studio One"" on CBS."
106697,L588493,u3157,m207,PETE,"Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college..."
106698,L588492,u3153,m207,LEO,"Well, that's not what they think."
106699,L588491,u3157,m207,PETE,"Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them."
106700,L588490,u3153,m207,LEO,"What, all of a sudden, ""Lucille Angstrom"" isn't a name?"
106701,L588489,u3157,m207,PETE,"Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that."
106702,L588488,u3153,m207,LEO,"Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do."
106703,L588487,u3157,m207,PETE,What do you mean?
106704,L588486,u3153,m207,LEO,"Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning."
106705,L588485,u3153,m207,LEO,"What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?"
106706,L588484,u3157,m207,PETE,"Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore."
106707,L588483,u3153,m207,LEO,Not at all.
106708,L588482,u3157,m207,PETE,"Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail."
106709,L588481,u3153,m207,LEO,Why not?
106710,L588480,u3157,m207,PETE,Not any more.
106711,L588479,u3153,m207,LEO,"Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer."
106712,L588478,u3157,m207,PETE,Luke didn't smoke.
106713,L588477,u3153,m207,LEO,When'd you quit smoking?
106714,L588476,u3157,m207,PETE,No thanks.
106715,L588475,u3153,m207,LEO,Cigarette?
106716,L588474,u3153,m207,LEO,"No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble."
106717,L588473,u3157,m207,PETE,I'm not sorry for what I said.
106718,L588472,u3153,m207,LEO,That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
106719,L588328,u3153,m207,LEO,"Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden."
106720,L588327,u3157,m207,PETE,"It's wrong, Leo."
106721,L588326,u3153,m207,LEO,"Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's."
106722,L588325,u3157,m207,PETE,That's not the country Luke fought for.
106723,L588324,u3153,m207,LEO,"Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it."
106724,L588320,u3157,m207,PETE,"So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one."
106725,L588319,u3153,m207,LEO,Exactly.
106726,L588318,u3157,m207,PETE,And I won't be a communist anymore.
106727,L588317,u3153,m207,LEO,"However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you."
106728,L588316,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them."
106729,L588315,u3153,m207,LEO,"The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong."
106730,L587620,u3157,m207,PETE,"Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!"
106731,L587619,u3153,m207,LEO,"Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?"
106732,L587618,u3157,m207,PETE,"So, it is a blacklist."
106733,L587617,u3153,m207,LEO,"That's the one, ""Ashes To Ashes."" I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen."
106734,L587616,u3157,m207,PETE,"""Ashes To Ashes?"""
106735,L587615,u3153,m207,LEO,"Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um..."
106736,L587614,u3157,m207,PETE,"Yeah, well, that's enough."
106737,L587613,u3153,m207,LEO,They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
106738,L587611,u3157,m207,PETE,Why not?
106739,L587610,u3153,m207,LEO,You can't testify.
106740,L587609,u3157,m207,PETE,"At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!"
106741,L587608,u3153,m207,LEO,You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
106742,L587607,u3157,m207,PETE,Exactly.
106743,L587606,u3153,m207,LEO,I know.  A Purple Heart.
106744,L587605,u3157,m207,PETE,I was decorated.
106745,L587604,u3153,m207,LEO,"Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix."
106746,L587603,u3157,m207,PETE,"Leo, you're my agent.  Tell ""them"" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!"
106747,L587602,u3153,m207,LEO,"They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know."
106748,L587601,u3157,m207,PETE,What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
106749,L587600,u3153,m207,LEO,"Kid, that cuts no ice with them."
106750,L587599,u3157,m207,PETE,"I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!"
106751,L587598,u3153,m207,LEO,You should watch what you say.
106752,L587597,u3157,m207,PETE,"Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway."
106753,L587596,u3153,m207,LEO,"So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization."
106754,L587595,u3157,m207,PETE,"No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!"
106755,L587594,u3153,m207,LEO,"Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell ""they"" is.  ""They"" know who ""they"" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?"
106756,L587593,u3157,m207,PETE,"Who the hell is this ""they?"""
106757,L587592,u3153,m207,LEO,"Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did."
106758,L587591,u3157,m207,PETE,I... I don't believe this.
106759,L587590,u3153,m207,LEO,"Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?"
106760,L588225,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
106761,L588224,u3154,m207,LUKE,What?
106762,L588223,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,"Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!"
106763,L588201,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,Some of it might come back to you.
106764,L588200,u3154,m207,LUKE,"No, I..."
106765,L588199,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,Sit.  Play with me.
106766,L588198,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,"Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it ""heaven music.""  ""Teach me some heaven music,"" you used to say."
106767,L588197,u3154,m207,LUKE,I can play the piano?
106768,L588196,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,I taught you that.
106769,L588195,u3154,m207,LUKE,That was beautiful.
106770,L588137,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,Nineteen-oh-nine.
106771,L588136,u3154,m207,LUKE,When was that?
106772,L588135,u3155,m207,MRS. TERWILLIGER,I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
106773,L588052,u3154,m207,LUKE,Oh.
106774,L588051,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,That's my r-r-rent.
106775,L588016,u3154,m207,LUKE,Yeah... me too.
106776,L588015,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,"T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war."
106777,L588012,u3154,m207,LUKE,Of course.
106778,L588011,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,"We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?"
106779,L588010,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat."
106780,L588009,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Cat.
106781,L588008,u3154,m207,LUKE,So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
106782,L588006,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me."
106783,L588005,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Found me.
106784,L587843,u3154,m207,LUKE,"Well, then, why do they call you ""Old Tim?"""
106785,L587842,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,No.
106786,L587841,u3154,m207,LUKE,Is there a young Tim?
106787,L588353,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,"I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here."
106788,L588352,u3157,m207,PETE,I thought you...
106789,L588351,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
106790,L588350,u3157,m207,PETE,My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
106791,L588349,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Oh...
106792,L588348,u3157,m207,PETE,"I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident."
106793,L588347,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Oh.
106794,L588346,u3157,m207,PETE,It's about me.
106795,L588345,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Oh.
106796,L588344,u3157,m207,PETE,"Tim, I have to tell you something."
106797,L588343,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,They will.  They w-w-will.
106798,L588342,u3157,m207,PETE,The customers?  I don't know...
106799,L588341,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,"They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back."
106800,L588340,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Thanks.
106801,L588339,u3157,m207,PETE,"Please, sit."
106802,L588338,u3157,m207,PETE,Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
106803,L588337,u3156,m207,OLD TIM,Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
106804,L587638,u3158,m207,SANDRA,I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
106805,L587637,u3157,m207,PETE,"Will you help me, Sandy?"
106806,L587634,u3157,m207,PETE,"They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help."
106807,L587633,u3158,m207,SANDRA,"You mean, he was... let go, too?"
106808,L587632,u3157,m207,PETE,"Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching."
106809,L587631,u3158,m207,SANDRA,"He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?"
106810,L587630,u3157,m207,PETE,I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
106811,L587629,u3158,m207,SANDRA,That you got let go.
106812,L587628,u3157,m207,PETE,What exactly did you hear?
106813,L587627,u3158,m207,SANDRA,What happened?
106814,L587574,u3157,m207,PETE,"You bet, honey."
106815,L587573,u3158,m207,SANDRA,"Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?"
106816,L587731,u3160,m207,STANTON,Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
106817,L587730,u3157,m207,PETE,"Thank you, Mr. Lawson."
106818,L587729,u3160,m207,STANTON,"Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off."
106819,L587700,u3160,m207,STANTON,Got any money?
106820,L587699,u3157,m207,PETE,Yes.  Very.
106821,L587698,u3160,m207,STANTON,"You hungry, son?"
106822,L587696,u3160,m207,STANTON,"Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe."
106823,L587695,u3157,m207,PETE,The war...
106824,L587694,u3160,m207,STANTON,Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
106825,L587693,u3160,m207,STANTON,"'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?"
106826,L587692,u3157,m207,PETE,They all know you?
106827,L587690,u3160,m207,STANTON,"You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?"
106828,L587689,u3157,m207,PETE,I suppose.  Thanks.
106829,L587688,u3160,m207,STANTON,"Actually, my grandpap.  But ""ancestors"" sounds better, don't it?  Here."
106830,L587687,u3157,m207,PETE,Ancestors?
106831,L588286,u3159,m207,SAUNDERS,All right.  All right.  We'll see.
106832,L588285,u3157,m207,PETE,No.  Absolutely not.
106833,L588284,u3159,m207,SAUNDERS,"Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?"
106834,L588282,u3157,m207,PETE,"No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner."
106835,L588281,u3159,m207,SAUNDERS,Would that be Miss Sinclair?
106836,L588280,u3157,m207,PETE,My girlfriend.  If she still is...
106837,L588279,u3159,m207,SAUNDERS,Who?
106838,L588278,u3157,m207,PETE,I already have.
106839,L588277,u3159,m207,SAUNDERS,"Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?"
106840,L589057,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark."
106841,L589056,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Look.
106842,L589055,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Is anyone there?
106843,L589052,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Then go.
106844,L589051,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
106845,L589050,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
106846,L589049,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?"
106847,L589048,u3162,m208,ANNIE,That's up to you.
106848,L589047,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Do you think I should go?
106849,L589045,u3171,m208,MELANIE,It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
106850,L589044,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie."
106851,L589043,u3171,m208,MELANIE,He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
106852,L589039,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever."
106853,L589038,u3171,m208,MELANIE,And the second?
106854,L589037,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason."
106855,L589036,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I did.
106856,L589035,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself."
106857,L589034,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I'm sorry. Forgive me.
106858,L589033,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"You get straight to the point, don't you?"
106859,L589032,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
106860,L589031,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished."
106861,L589030,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I see.
106862,L589029,u3162,m208,ANNIE,I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
106863,L589028,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
106864,L589027,u3162,m208,ANNIE,She already has a daughter.
106865,L589026,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
106866,L589025,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned."
106867,L589024,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman."
106868,L589023,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
106869,L589022,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't understand.
106870,L589021,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Afraid I'd give Mitch.
106871,L589020,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Afraid you'd take Mitch?
106872,L589019,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Because she was afraid.
106873,L589018,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Then why did she object to you?
106874,L589017,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends."
106875,L589016,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Then what was it?
106876,L589015,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all."
106877,L589014,u3171,m208,MELANIE,And what had you done?
106878,L589013,u3162,m208,ANNIE,When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
106879,L589012,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it."
106880,L589011,u3171,m208,MELANIE,A trifle.
106881,L589010,u3162,m208,ANNIE,With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
106882,L589009,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Different?
106883,L589008,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now."
106884,L589007,u3171,m208,MELANIE,When was this?
106885,L589006,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia."
106886,L589005,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What do you mean?
106887,L589004,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
106888,L589003,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
106889,L589002,u3162,m208,ANNIE,You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
106890,L589001,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I suspected as much.
106891,L589000,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"I guess you knew that, anyway."
106892,L588998,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago."
106893,L588997,u3171,m208,MELANIE,How'd you happen to come here?
106894,L588996,u3162,m208,ANNIE,San Francisco.
106895,L588995,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Where are you from originally, Annie?"
106896,L588994,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to."
106897,L588993,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I despise it.
106898,L588992,u3162,m208,ANNIE,How do you like our little hamlet?
106899,L588991,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I think so.
106900,L588990,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Or would you rather I changed the subject?
106901,L588987,u3162,m208,ANNIE,It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
106902,L588986,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Thank you.
106903,L588985,u3162,m208,ANNIE,All right.
106904,L588984,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?"
106905,L588983,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?"
106906,L588982,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"If you have some, I'd..."
106907,L588981,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Would you like some brandy?
106908,L588980,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, it's not the cut that's bothering me."
106909,L588979,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
106910,L588978,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
106911,L588977,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Miss Daniels? Is that you?
106912,L588847,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?"
106913,L588846,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here."
106914,L588845,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it."
106915,L588844,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
106916,L588843,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full."
106917,L588842,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Well, I'd really hope to rent it for..."
106918,L588841,u3171,m208,MELANIE,That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
106919,L588840,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Yes?
106920,L588839,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I was wondering...
106921,L588838,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, I did."
106922,L588837,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?"
106923,L588736,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Thank you.
106924,L588735,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels."
106925,L588734,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Lovebirds.
106926,L588733,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?"
106927,L588731,u3162,m208,ANNIE,I guess that's where everyone meets him.
106928,L588730,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
106929,L588729,u3162,m208,ANNIE,It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
106930,L588728,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
106931,L588727,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Did you drive up from San Francisco?
106932,L588724,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"Actually, it's none of my business."
106933,L588723,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
106934,L588722,u3162,m208,ANNIE,You're leaving after you see Cathy?
106935,L588721,u3171,m208,MELANIE,No. Just a few hours.
106936,L588720,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
106937,L588719,u3171,m208,MELANIE,It's a lovely garden.
106938,L588718,u3162,m208,ANNIE,"I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know."
106939,L588717,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, not really."
106940,L588716,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Are you a friend of Mitch's?
106941,L588714,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
106942,L588713,u3171,m208,MELANIE,They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
106943,L588712,u3162,m208,ANNIE,That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
106944,L588711,u3171,m208,MELANIE,The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
106945,L588710,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Cathy?
106946,L588709,u3171,m208,MELANIE,The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
106947,L588708,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Yes?
106948,L588707,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but..."
106949,L588706,u3162,m208,ANNIE,Yes?
106950,L588705,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Miss Hayworth?
106951,L589639,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Take them.
106952,L589638,u3163,m208,CATHY,They haven't harmed anyone.
106953,L589570,u3168,m208,LYDIA,They're birds!
106954,L589569,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Mom, they're in a cage!"
106955,L589568,u3168,m208,LYDIA,No!
106956,L589567,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?"
106957,L589555,u3168,m208,LYDIA,If your father were here...
106958,L589554,u3163,m208,CATHY,Mother!
106959,L589130,u3163,m208,CATHY,Just listen to them!
106960,L589129,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Yes, I did."
106961,L588880,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?"
106962,L588879,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice..."
106963,L588878,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice."
106964,L588877,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Cathy!
106965,L588876,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods."
106966,L588871,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?"
106967,L588870,u3163,m208,CATHY,"It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good."
106968,L588869,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either."
106969,L588900,u3163,m208,CATHY,"If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party."
106970,L588899,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
106971,L588898,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge."
106972,L588897,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't know yet.
106973,L588896,u3163,m208,CATHY,Don't you like Bodega Bay?
106974,L588895,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Darling, of course I do!"
106975,L588894,u3163,m208,CATHY,Don't you like us?
106976,L588893,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
106977,L588892,u3163,m208,CATHY,Are you coming to my party?
106978,L588891,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I know.
106979,L588890,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know."
106980,L588889,u3163,m208,CATHY,Just a little one.
106981,L588888,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't think your mother would like that.
106982,L588887,u3163,m208,CATHY,Could I have a puff?
106983,L588886,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Oh, I suppose so."
106984,L588885,u3163,m208,CATHY,Is smoking fun?
106985,L588873,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Your brother told me.
106986,L588872,u3163,m208,CATHY,I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
106987,L588856,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well, I suppose..."
106988,L588855,u3163,m208,CATHY,They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
106989,L588854,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes?
106990,L588853,u3163,m208,CATHY,Miss Daniels?
106991,L589657,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I think they'll be all right, honey."
106992,L589656,u3163,m208,CATHY,Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
106993,L589647,u3172,m208,MITCH,Shhh. Shhhhh.
106994,L589646,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Mitch, let's turn back."
106995,L589607,u3163,m208,CATHY,Is she all right?
106996,L589606,u3172,m208,MITCH,Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
106997,L589575,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people."
106998,L589574,u3163,m208,CATHY,Why are they trying to kill people?
106999,L589573,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I don't know, honey."
107000,L589572,u3163,m208,CATHY,Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
107001,L589128,u3163,m208,CATHY,"Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?"
107002,L589127,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco."
107003,L589124,u3172,m208,MITCH,"That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie."
107004,L589123,u3163,m208,CATHY,We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
107005,L589119,u3163,m208,CATHY,What's the matter with them?
107006,L589118,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Take it into the living room, would you, hon?"
107007,L589117,u3163,m208,CATHY,Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
107008,L589116,u3172,m208,MITCH,She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
107009,L589115,u3163,m208,CATHY,Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
107010,L588690,u3164,m208,CLERK,It's Alice.
107011,L588689,u3166,m208,HARRY'S VOICE,"No, it's Lois!"
107012,L588688,u3164,m208,CLERK,"It's Alice, ain't it?"
107013,L588687,u3166,m208,HARRY'S VOICE,Lois!
107014,L588686,u3164,m208,CLERK,The little Brenner girl.
107015,L588685,u3166,m208,HARRY'S VOICE,What?
107016,L588701,u3164,m208,CLERK,It's nothing.
107017,L588700,u3171,m208,MELANIE,How much for the phone calls?
107018,L588699,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
107019,L588698,u3164,m208,CLERK,Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
107020,L588697,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Thank you.
107021,L588696,u3164,m208,CLERK,"Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl."
107022,L588695,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes?
107023,L588694,u3164,m208,CLERK,"That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?"
107024,L588693,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I need her exact name, you see."
107025,L588692,u3164,m208,CLERK,"Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean."
107026,L588691,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Are you sure?
107027,L588684,u3164,m208,CLERK,"Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?"
107028,L588683,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107029,L588682,u3164,m208,CLERK,The little Brenner girl?
107030,L588681,u3171,m208,MELANIE,The little girl's name.
107031,L588680,u3164,m208,CLERK,Yep?
107032,L588679,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I wonder if you could tell me...
107033,L588678,u3164,m208,CLERK,Okay.
107034,L588677,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Daniels.
107035,L588676,u3164,m208,CLERK,What name?
107036,L588675,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Thank you.
107037,L588674,u3164,m208,CLERK,D'you want me to order one for you?
107038,L588673,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Of course.
107039,L588672,u3164,m208,CLERK,Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
107040,L588671,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Where would I get a boat?
107041,L588670,u3164,m208,CLERK,"Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do."
107042,L588669,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"It's a surprise, you see."
107043,L588668,u3164,m208,CLERK,Mmmm.
107044,L588667,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me."
107045,L588666,u3164,m208,CLERK,Mmmm.
107046,L588665,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"You see, I wanted to surprise them."
107047,L588664,u3164,m208,CLERK,"Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door."
107048,L588663,u3171,m208,MELANIE,The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
107049,L588662,u3164,m208,CLERK,Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
107050,L588661,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I see. How do I get down there?
107051,L588660,u3164,m208,CLERK,Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
107052,L588659,u3171,m208,MELANIE,The two kids?
107053,L588658,u3164,m208,CLERK,"Nope, just Lydia and the two kids."
107054,L588657,u3171,m208,MELANIE,The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
107055,L588656,u3171,m208,MELANIE,That's where the Brenners live.
107056,L588655,u3164,m208,CLERK,And the white house?
107057,L588654,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes?
107058,L588653,u3164,m208,CLERK,See them two big trees across there?
107059,L588652,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes?
107060,L588651,u3164,m208,CLERK,See where I'm pointing?
107061,L588650,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Where?
107062,L588649,u3164,m208,CLERK,Right across the bay there.
107063,L588648,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, but where?"
107064,L588647,u3164,m208,CLERK,Right here. Bodega Bay.
107065,L588646,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Where does he live?
107066,L588645,u3164,m208,CLERK,Yep.
107067,L588644,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Do you know him?
107068,L588643,u3164,m208,CLERK,Yep.
107069,L588642,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
107070,L588641,u3164,m208,CLERK,Try my best.
107071,L588640,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I wonder if you could help me.
107072,L588639,u3164,m208,CLERK,Morning.
107073,L588638,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Good morning.
107074,L589494,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,Birds are not bad!
107075,L589493,u3165,m208,DEKE,What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
107076,L589393,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world..."
107077,L589392,u3165,m208,DEKE,"Why not, Mrs. Bundy?"
107078,L589341,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded..."
107079,L589340,u3165,m208,DEKE,I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
107080,L589327,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,Impossible.
107081,L589326,u3165,m208,DEKE,"Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school."
107082,L589320,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
107083,L589319,u3165,m208,DEKE,"I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious."
107084,L589500,u3172,m208,MITCH,They're back!
107085,L589499,u3165,m208,DEKE,Gulls!
107086,L589488,u3172,m208,MITCH,We'll make our own fog.
107087,L589487,u3165,m208,DEKE,"We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch."
107088,L588755,u3165,m208,DEKE,"Well, you're the lawyer."
107089,L588754,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
107090,L588753,u3165,m208,DEKE,"I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash."
107091,L588752,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat."
107092,L588751,u3165,m208,DEKE,"You cut yourself outside, Miss?"
107093,L588750,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
107094,L588749,u3165,m208,DEKE,Shall I call the doctor?
107095,L588748,u3172,m208,MITCH,Young woman cut herself.
107096,L588747,u3165,m208,DEKE,What happened?
107097,L588746,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?"
107098,L589400,u3167,m208,HELEN,"Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?"
107099,L589399,u3176,m208,SHOLES,No. Here's fine.
107100,L589398,u3167,m208,HELEN,"Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?"
107101,L589376,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said."
107102,L589375,u3167,m208,HELEN,One apple pie! You want more coffee?
107103,L589374,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls..."
107104,L589373,u3167,m208,HELEN,"Are you finished here, Sebastian?"
107105,L589635,u3172,m208,MITCH,You don't have to.
107106,L589634,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I started to say... inside...
107107,L589633,u3172,m208,MITCH,"What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!"
107108,L589632,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch."
107109,L589631,u3172,m208,MITCH,We'll worry about that when we get there.
107110,L589630,u3168,m208,LYDIA,If they are?
107111,L589629,u3172,m208,MITCH,They won't be.
107112,L589628,u3168,m208,LYDIA,If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
107113,L589627,u3172,m208,MITCH,"We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack."
107114,L589626,u3168,m208,LYDIA,We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
107115,L589625,u3172,m208,MITCH,I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
107116,L589624,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go."
107117,L589623,u3172,m208,MITCH,We won't be here.
107118,L589622,u3168,m208,LYDIA,But they'll be back.
107119,L589621,u3172,m208,MITCH,They're gone. The same pattern.
107120,L589618,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I mean. I want to...
107121,L589617,u3172,m208,MITCH,You're doing fine.
107122,L589616,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"I'm not very good at this, Mitch."
107123,L589612,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I know you can.  But I'd like to.
107124,L589611,u3172,m208,MITCH,I can handle it.
107125,L589604,u3172,m208,MITCH,Get a rope!
107126,L589603,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Oh, my God, look at her!"
107127,L589602,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Mother, get a rope!"
107128,L589577,u3172,m208,MITCH,Shhh. Shhh.
107129,L589576,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Mitch...
107130,L589557,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"I'm sorry, Mitch."
107131,L589556,u3172,m208,MITCH,Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
107132,L589553,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?"
107133,L589552,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
107134,L589551,u3168,m208,LYDIA,What happens when we run out of wood?
107135,L589550,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
107136,L589549,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Where will we go?
107137,L589548,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't know when.  We'll see what...
107138,L589547,u3168,m208,LYDIA,When?
107139,L589546,u3172,m208,MITCH,Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
107140,L589545,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Maybe we ought to leave.
107141,L589544,u3172,m208,MITCH,That's a chance we have to take.
107142,L589543,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house."
107143,L589542,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't know.
107144,L589541,u3168,m208,LYDIA,When do you think they'll come?
107145,L589540,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I got them all, Mother."
107146,L589539,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?"
107147,L589157,u3172,m208,MITCH,That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
107148,L589156,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Tell him about the party.
107149,L589097,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I think he got a little scratch, Mother."
107150,L589096,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Well... well, is everyone all right?"
107151,L588928,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I know exactly what I want, Mother."
107152,L588927,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch."
107153,L588926,u3172,m208,MITCH,I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
107154,L588925,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Yes?
107155,L588924,u3172,m208,MITCH,Mother?
107156,L588923,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to..."
107157,L588922,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I know, Mother."
107158,L588921,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked."
107159,L588920,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Yes, Mother."
107160,L588919,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?"
107161,L588918,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I know, Mother."
107162,L588917,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch."
107163,L588916,u3172,m208,MITCH,I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
107164,L588915,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?"
107165,L588914,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Mother, where did you go to law school?"
107166,L588913,u3168,m208,LYDIA,But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
107167,L588912,u3172,m208,MITCH,"No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated."
107168,L588911,u3168,m208,LYDIA,She was selling birds.
107169,L588910,u3172,m208,MITCH,Yes.
107170,L588909,u3168,m208,LYDIA,In a bird shop.
107171,L588908,u3172,m208,MITCH,I told you. We met yesterday.
107172,L588907,u3168,m208,LYDIA,How long have you known her?
107173,L588906,u3172,m208,MITCH,Yes.
107174,L588905,u3168,m208,LYDIA,And certainly pretty.
107175,L588904,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Yes, very."
107176,L588903,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?"
107177,L588866,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup."
107178,L588865,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'm simply quoting the law.
107179,L588864,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Whose side are you on?
107180,L588863,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware."
107181,L588862,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"He sold the feed to me, didn't he?"
107182,L588861,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
107183,L588860,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now."
107184,L588827,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?"
107185,L588826,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Seven o'clock, same as usual."
107186,L588821,u3172,m208,MITCH,"...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend..."
107187,L588820,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Lovebirds, I see."
107188,L588819,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you..."
107189,L588818,u3168,m208,LYDIA,You did say birds?
107190,L588815,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight."
107191,L588814,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Across at Brinkmeyer's.
107192,L588813,u3172,m208,MITCH,"For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?"
107193,L588812,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Oh. I see.
107194,L588811,u3172,m208,MITCH,"A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco."
107195,L588810,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?"
107196,L588809,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother."
107197,L588808,u3168,m208,LYDIA,A what?
107198,L588807,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet..."
107199,L588806,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
107200,L589615,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Please.
107201,L589614,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Shhhh. Shhhh.
107202,L589613,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner."
107203,L589566,u3171,m208,MELANIE,And locked it.
107204,L589565,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Did you close the door?
107205,L589564,u3171,m208,MELANIE,That's the last of it.
107206,L589281,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I'll just clear up here, and then dress."
107207,L589280,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Would you? I'd feel so much better.
107208,L589279,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I don't mind, really."
107209,L589278,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I couldn't ask you to.
107210,L589277,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Would you like me to go for her?
107211,L589276,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
107212,L589275,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner."
107213,L589274,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here."
107214,L589273,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I think it might also matter to Mitch.
107215,L589272,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
107216,L589271,u3171,m208,MELANIE,And if you don't?
107217,L589270,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses."
107218,L589269,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?"
107219,L589268,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
107220,L589267,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Why, Mrs. Brenner?"
107221,L589266,u3168,m208,LYDIA,No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
107222,L589265,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner."
107223,L589264,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here."
107224,L589263,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I wish I could be that way.
107225,L589262,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107226,L589261,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent."
107227,L589260,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Annie's there. She'll be all right.
107228,L589259,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?"
107229,L589258,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
107230,L589257,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner."
107231,L589256,u3168,m208,LYDIA,I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
107232,L589255,u3171,m208,MELANIE,No.
107233,L589254,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Do I sound foolish to you?
107234,L589253,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, I'm sure she's fine."
107235,L589252,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Cathy. At the school.
107236,L589251,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What?
107237,L589250,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Do you think Cathy's all right?
107238,L589249,u3168,m208,LYDIA,What good will they do?
107239,L589248,u3171,m208,MELANIE,He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
107240,L589247,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Then he saw.
107241,L589246,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner."
107242,L589245,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
107243,L589244,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
107244,L589243,u3168,m208,LYDIA,Where's Mitch?
107245,L589242,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Oh, thank you."
107246,L589241,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea."
107247,L589126,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?"
107248,L589125,u3171,m208,MELANIE,If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
107249,L588875,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, not exactly."
107250,L588874,u3168,m208,LYDIA,"Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?"
107251,L589492,u3172,m208,MITCH,We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
107252,L589491,u3169,m208,MALONE,"There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's..."
107253,L589446,u3169,m208,MALONE,"Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact."
107254,L589445,u3172,m208,MITCH,He was killed last night. By birds.
107255,L589174,u3169,m208,MALONE,"Goodnight, Lydia."
107256,L589173,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Thanks, Al. We'll be all right."
107257,L589172,u3169,m208,MALONE,"Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch..."
107258,L589166,u3169,m208,MALONE,"No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?"
107259,L589165,u3172,m208,MITCH,Does this room look silly?
107260,L589159,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after..."
107261,L589158,u3169,m208,MALONE,"Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?"
107262,L589155,u3169,m208,MALONE,"What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it."
107263,L589154,u3172,m208,MITCH,These birds were...
107264,L589153,u3169,m208,MALONE,"Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there."
107265,L589152,u3169,m208,MALONE,My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
107266,L589151,u3172,m208,MITCH,"All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney."
107267,L589150,u3169,m208,MALONE,"What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all."
107268,L589149,u3172,m208,MITCH,Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
107269,L589148,u3169,m208,MALONE,"I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?"
107270,L589147,u3172,m208,MITCH,"What are we going to do about it, Al?"
107271,L589146,u3169,m208,MALONE,"'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing."
107272,L589145,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Yes, but the curtains were drawn."
107273,L589144,u3169,m208,MALONE,"No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something."
107274,L589143,u3172,m208,MITCH,Not by the thousands.
107275,L589142,u3169,m208,MALONE,"Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know."
107276,L589141,u3172,m208,MITCH,"We know what it is, Al."
107277,L589140,u3169,m208,MALONE,"That's a chimney swift, all right."
107278,L588635,u3170,m208,MAN,I'm awfully sorry.
107279,L588634,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them."
107280,L588633,u3170,m208,MAN,"I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose."
107281,L588632,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Oh.
107282,L588631,u3170,m208,MAN,About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
107283,L588630,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Sixty...  Oh.
107284,L588629,u3170,m208,MAN,Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
107285,L588628,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Bodega Bay? Where's that?
107286,L588627,u3170,m208,MAN,Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
107287,L588626,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well, where did he go?"
107288,L588625,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well, I..."
107289,L588624,u3170,m208,MAN,"Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?"
107290,L588623,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Monday?
107291,L588622,u3170,m208,MAN,"He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him...."
107292,L588621,u3171,m208,MELANIE,That's all right.
107293,L588620,u3170,m208,MAN,He's not home.
107294,L588619,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107295,L588618,u3170,m208,MAN,Is that for Mitch Brenner?
107296,L589650,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right."
107297,L589649,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Can we turn back?
107298,L589643,u3172,m208,MITCH,We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
107299,L589642,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement..."
107300,L589594,u3171,m208,MELANIE,No... wait.  Hold me.
107301,L589593,u3172,m208,MITCH,We'd better light some of those lamps.
107302,L589592,u3172,m208,MITCH,Wait here. Don't move.
107303,L589591,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Mitch...
107304,L589590,u3172,m208,MITCH,The power.
107305,L589589,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
107306,L589588,u3172,m208,MITCH,You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
107307,L589585,u3172,m208,MITCH,How about you?
107308,L589584,u3171,m208,MELANIE,You must be exhausted.
107309,L589583,u3172,m208,MITCH,Almost two a.m.
107310,L589582,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What time is it?
107311,L589581,u3172,m208,MITCH,I thought they'd have stopped by now.
107312,L589580,u3171,m208,MELANIE,When will they stop?
107313,L589562,u3172,m208,MITCH,Maybe.
107314,L589561,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Santa Rosa?
107315,L589560,u3172,m208,MITCH,Inland.
107316,L589559,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Where are they heading?
107317,L589530,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired."
107318,L589529,u3172,m208,MITCH,Have we still got power?
107319,L589528,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
107320,L589527,u3172,m208,MITCH,Do you want to try your father again?
107321,L589525,u3172,m208,MITCH,It may not be last week again for a long long time.
107322,L589524,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week."
107323,L589523,u3172,m208,MITCH,"It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise..."
107324,L589522,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I keep thinking of Annie.
107325,L589521,u3172,m208,MITCH,"The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again."
107326,L589520,u3171,m208,MELANIE,How long have they been gathering there?
107327,L589519,u3172,m208,MITCH,The bay doesn't.
107328,L589518,u3171,m208,MELANIE,The town looks clear.
107329,L589509,u3172,m208,MITCH,We've got to get Cathy.
107330,L589508,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Don't let's take any chances.
107331,L589507,u3172,m208,MITCH,I think it's safe to get out now.
107332,L589442,u3171,m208,MELANIE,At Annie's house. She's all right.
107333,L589441,u3172,m208,MITCH,I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
107334,L589238,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
107335,L589237,u3172,m208,MITCH,That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
107336,L589221,u3171,m208,MELANIE,...everything I know.
107337,L589220,u3172,m208,MITCH,Melanie...
107338,L589219,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
107339,L589218,u3172,m208,MITCH,"No, no..."
107340,L589217,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I'm frightened, Mitch."
107341,L589216,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Melanie, Melanie..."
107342,L589213,u3172,m208,MITCH,"No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and..."
107343,L589212,u3171,m208,MELANIE,It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
107344,L589211,u3172,m208,MITCH,I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
107345,L589210,u3171,m208,MELANIE,After the gulls attacked.
107346,L589209,u3172,m208,MITCH,What do you mean?
107347,L589208,u3171,m208,MELANIE,It was like that yesterday.
107348,L589207,u3172,m208,MITCH,It's so damn quiet out there.
107349,L589206,u3171,m208,MELANIE,With my little sparrow leading team.
107350,L589205,u3172,m208,MITCH,"They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it."
107351,L589204,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Mmm?
107352,L589203,u3172,m208,MITCH,"What it was, probably..."
107353,L589202,u3171,m208,MELANIE,You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
107354,L589201,u3172,m208,MITCH,Take wing!
107355,L589200,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!"
107356,L589199,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Hear, hear!"
107357,L589198,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
107358,L589197,u3172,m208,MITCH,Hear!
107359,L589196,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. ""Why should humans rule?"" they asked themselves."
107360,L589195,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Well, they'll go along with anything."
107361,L589194,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks..."
107362,L589193,u3172,m208,MITCH,So they united.
107363,L589192,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over..."
107364,L589191,u3172,m208,MITCH,Growing a beard...
107365,L589190,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen..."
107366,L589189,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Certainly, of birds."
107367,L589188,u3172,m208,MITCH,Of birds?
107368,L589187,u3171,m208,MELANIE,It's an uprising.
107369,L589186,u3172,m208,MITCH,Really? Tell me about it.
107370,L589185,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way."
107371,L589184,u3172,m208,MITCH,It smelled of the fire.
107372,L589170,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I think I should, don't you?"
107373,L589169,u3172,m208,MITCH,Are you staying?
107374,L589168,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I'll take Cathy up to bed.
107375,L589132,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I'll get it.
107376,L589131,u3172,m208,MITCH,Some cream?
107377,L589114,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, thank you."
107378,L589113,u3172,m208,MITCH,Do you want some mustard with this?
107379,L589112,u3172,m208,MITCH,Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
107380,L589111,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, I have my things in the car."
107381,L589110,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?"
107382,L589109,u3171,m208,MELANIE,A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
107383,L589108,u3172,m208,MITCH,Last night? What do you mean?
107384,L589107,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now..."
107385,L589106,u3172,m208,MITCH,You look a little shaken.
107386,L589092,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107387,L589091,u3172,m208,MITCH,Are you all right?
107388,L589086,u3172,m208,MITCH,"No, tell me."
107389,L589085,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"You'll think me very bold, sir."
107390,L589084,u3172,m208,MITCH,What'll it say?
107391,L589083,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her."
107392,L589082,u3172,m208,MITCH,What?
107393,L589081,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
107394,L589080,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'm glad you do.
107395,L589079,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
107396,L589078,u3172,m208,MITCH,And Fridays? What do you do then?
107397,L589077,u3171,m208,MELANIE,On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
107398,L589076,u3172,m208,MITCH,What about Thursdays and Fridays?
107399,L589075,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because..."
107400,L589074,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107401,L589073,u3172,m208,MITCH,Helping travelers.
107402,L589072,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport."
107403,L589071,u3172,m208,MITCH,Like what?
107404,L589070,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I do different things on different days.
107405,L589069,u3172,m208,MITCH,What do you do?
107406,L589068,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I have several jobs.
107407,L589067,u3172,m208,MITCH,You have a job?
107408,L589066,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing."
107409,L589065,u3172,m208,MITCH,Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
107410,L589064,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
107411,L589063,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Cheers.
107412,L589062,u3172,m208,MITCH,Cheers.
107413,L589061,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
107414,L589060,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
107415,L589059,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
107416,L588976,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
107417,L588975,u3172,m208,MITCH,What do you want ?
107418,L588974,u3171,m208,MELANIE,But not for me.
107419,L588973,u3172,m208,MITCH,It is for me.
107420,L588972,u3171,m208,MELANIE,That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
107421,L588971,u3172,m208,MITCH,I think it could be fun.
107422,L588970,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Why?
107423,L588969,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'd still like to see you.
107424,L588968,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't give a damn what you believe!
107425,L588967,u3172,m208,MITCH,Do you expect me to believe...?
107426,L588966,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I told you what happened in Rome!
107427,L588965,u3172,m208,MITCH,Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
107428,L588964,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
107429,L588963,u3172,m208,MITCH,Why?
107430,L588962,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107431,L588961,u3172,m208,MITCH,But you tore it up.
107432,L588960,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"It said, ""Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality."" That's what it said."
107433,L588959,u3172,m208,MITCH,What did it say?
107434,L588958,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I wrote the letter.
107435,L588957,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?"
107436,L588956,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, I was lying."
107437,L588955,u3172,m208,MITCH,You were lying.
107438,L588954,u3171,m208,MELANIE,No.
107439,L588953,u3172,m208,MITCH,And you didn't come up here to see her.
107440,L588952,u3171,m208,MELANIE,No.
107441,L588951,u3172,m208,MITCH,So you didn't go to school together.
107442,L588950,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here."
107443,L588949,u3172,m208,MITCH,Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
107444,L588948,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too."
107445,L588947,u3172,m208,MITCH,"...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?"
107446,L588946,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107447,L588945,u3172,m208,MITCH,...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
107448,L588944,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, but..."
107449,L588943,u3172,m208,MITCH,The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
107450,L588942,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular..."
107451,L588941,u3172,m208,MITCH,"You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?"
107452,L588940,u3171,m208,MELANIE,With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
107453,L588939,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Without any clothes on?
107454,L588938,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain."
107455,L588937,u3172,m208,MITCH,Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
107456,L588936,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Oh. That. Rome.
107457,L588935,u3172,m208,MITCH,I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
107458,L588934,u3171,m208,MELANIE,How does Mother know what I like to do?
107459,L588933,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
107460,L588932,u3171,m208,MELANIE,San Francisco's a long way from here.
107461,L588931,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Will I be seeing you again?
107462,L588930,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Oh, yes."
107463,L588929,u3172,m208,MITCH,"You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?"
107464,L588884,u3172,m208,MITCH,His wife changed the channel.
107465,L588883,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What?
107466,L588882,u3172,m208,MITCH,He was watching a ball game on television.
107467,L588881,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Why did he shoot her?
107468,L588859,u3172,m208,MITCH,Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
107469,L588858,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Famished.
107470,L588857,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?"
107471,L588834,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Maybe.
107472,L588833,u3172,m208,MITCH,Seven o'clock then.
107473,L588832,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I'm sure.
107474,L588831,u3172,m208,MITCH,You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
107475,L588830,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way."
107476,L588829,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?"
107477,L588828,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"With... with Annie, of course."
107478,L588825,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?"
107479,L588824,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Certainly, but..."
107480,L588823,u3172,m208,MITCH,"You are, aren't you?"
107481,L588822,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, but..."
107482,L588817,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
107483,L588816,u3172,m208,MITCH,"After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds."
107484,L588804,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Look, Mr. Brenner..."
107485,L588803,u3172,m208,MITCH,Right next to the one you already had.
107486,L588802,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
107487,L588801,u3172,m208,MITCH,"But you were coming up anyway, remember?"
107488,L588800,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to..."
107489,L588799,u3172,m208,MITCH,Can't see a thing.
107490,L588798,u3171,m208,MELANIE,None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
107491,L588797,u3172,m208,MITCH,What did it say?
107492,L588796,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up."
107493,L588795,u3172,m208,MITCH,"You like me, huh?"
107494,L588794,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you..."
107495,L588793,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and..."
107496,L588792,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Why would I want to see you, of all people?"
107497,L588791,u3172,m208,MITCH,I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
107498,L588790,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107499,L588789,u3172,m208,MITCH,"So you came up to see Annie, huh?"
107500,L588787,u3172,m208,MITCH,"It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on."
107501,L588786,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Oh, no you don't!"
107502,L588785,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?"
107503,L588784,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
107504,L588783,u3172,m208,MITCH,Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
107505,L588782,u3171,m208,MELANIE,We... we went to school together. College.
107506,L588781,u3172,m208,MITCH,How do you know Annie?
107507,L588780,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107508,L588779,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth."
107509,L588778,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Annie. Annie Hayworth.
107510,L588777,u3172,m208,MITCH,Yes?
107511,L588776,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Why...
107512,L588775,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
107513,L588774,u3171,m208,MELANIE,To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
107514,L588773,u3172,m208,MITCH,What for?
107515,L588772,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway."
107516,L588771,u3172,m208,MITCH,You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
107517,L588770,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Didn't you see the lovebirds?
107518,L588769,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
107519,L588768,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Ouch!
107520,L588766,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Only violators and practical jokers.
107521,L588765,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Not everyone, Miss Daniels."
107522,L588764,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
107523,L588763,u3172,m208,MITCH,Criminal.
107524,L588762,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What kind of law?
107525,L588761,u3172,m208,MITCH,"No, San Francisco. What are you...?"
107526,L588760,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Do you practice here?
107527,L588759,u3172,m208,MITCH,That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
107528,L588758,u3171,m208,MELANIE,So you're a lawyer.
107529,L588757,u3172,m208,MITCH,Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
107530,L588756,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What's that?
107531,L588739,u3172,m208,MITCH,It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
107532,L588738,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What made it...
107533,L588737,u3172,m208,MITCH,That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
107534,L588601,u3172,m208,MITCH,I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
107535,L588600,u3171,m208,MELANIE,And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
107536,L588599,u3172,m208,MITCH,I am.  Good day.  Madam.
107537,L588598,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I think you're a louse.
107538,L588597,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?"
107539,L588596,u3171,m208,MELANIE,You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
107540,L588595,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Ahhh, but I really do want those birds."
107541,L588594,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
107542,L588593,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers."
107543,L588592,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What are you? A policeman?
107544,L588591,u3172,m208,MITCH,"No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!"
107545,L588590,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I didn't break that window!
107546,L588589,u3172,m208,MITCH,Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
107547,L588588,u3171,m208,MELANIE,When?
107548,L588587,u3172,m208,MITCH,That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
107549,L588586,u3171,m208,MELANIE,We never met in court or anyplace else.
107550,L588585,u3172,m208,MITCH,We met in court.
107551,L588584,u3171,m208,MELANIE,How?
107552,L588583,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Ahhh, but I know you."
107553,L588582,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't know you.
107554,L588581,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Hey, wait a minute!"
107555,L588580,u3172,m208,MITCH,"A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam."
107556,L588579,u3171,m208,MELANIE,But how... how do you know my name?
107557,L588578,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels."
107558,L588577,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What did you say?
107559,L588568,u3172,m208,MITCH,All right.  She smiles back.
107560,L588567,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
107561,L588566,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss..."
107562,L588565,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
107563,L588564,u3172,m208,MITCH,How can you tell?
107564,L588563,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Some of them are.
107565,L588562,u3172,m208,MITCH,Are they moulting now?
107566,L588561,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time."
107567,L588560,u3172,m208,MITCH,I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
107568,L588559,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species."
107569,L588558,u3172,m208,MITCH,I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
107570,L588557,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know."
107571,L588556,u3172,m208,MITCH,All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
107572,L588555,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Doesn't what make me...?
107573,L588554,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?"
107574,L588553,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds..."
107575,L588552,u3172,m208,MITCH,The sign says strawberry finches.
107576,L588551,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, sir, those are... redbirds."
107577,L588550,u3172,m208,MITCH,Aren't these lovebirds?
107578,L588549,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see."
107579,L588548,u3172,m208,MITCH,Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
107580,L588547,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, of course not."
107581,L588546,u3172,m208,MITCH,"As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either."
107582,L588545,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I understand completely, sir."
107583,L588544,u3172,m208,MITCH,"These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative."
107584,L588543,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well... yes, sir, there are."
107585,L588542,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?"
107586,L588541,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Lovebirds, sir?"
107587,L588540,u3172,m208,MITCH,Lovebirds.
107588,L588539,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?"
107589,L588538,u3172,m208,MITCH,I said I wonder if you could help me.
107590,L588537,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What?
107591,L588536,u3172,m208,MITCH,I wonder if you could help me.
107592,L588615,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie."
107593,L588614,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
107594,L588613,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?"
107595,L588612,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Well... well, how soon would you want them?"
107596,L588611,u3171,m208,MELANIE,How soon?
107597,L588610,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you."
107598,L588609,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Do you have any lovebirds?
107599,L588608,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Yes, certainly."
107600,L588607,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?"
107601,L588606,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
107602,L588605,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"What? Oh, yes, certainly."
107603,L588604,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Have you got a pencil?
107604,L588603,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,I have no idea.
107605,L588602,u3171,m208,MELANIE,That... that... who was that?
107606,L588575,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Oh, good! Oh, wonderful."
107607,L588574,u3171,m208,MELANIE,There we are!
107608,L588534,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well, all right, but..."
107609,L588533,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?"
107610,L588532,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Oh. Oh, well, all right."
107611,L588531,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
107612,L588530,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?"
107613,L588529,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Yes.
107614,L588528,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk."
107615,L588527,u3171,m208,MELANIE,And he'll talk?
107616,L588526,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown."
107617,L588525,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?"
107618,L588524,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to..."
107619,L588523,u3171,m208,MELANIE,You said three o'clock.
107620,L588522,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet."
107621,L588520,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What do you suppose it is?
107622,L588519,u3174,m208,MRS. MACGRUDER,"Hello, Miss Daniels."
107623,L588518,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?"
107624,L589414,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?"
107625,L589413,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Maybe! Is it impossible?
107626,L589412,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
107627,L589389,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
107628,L589388,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know."
107629,L589387,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
107630,L589386,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between..."
107631,L589385,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
107632,L589370,u3171,m208,MELANIE,No one called it a war!
107633,L589369,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
107634,L589368,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!"
107635,L589367,u3171,m208,MELANIE,I don't know why.
107636,L589365,u3171,m208,MELANIE,To...  To kill them.
107637,L589364,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,For what purpose?
107638,L589363,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Daniels. I think they were after the children.
107639,L589362,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"What do you think they were after, Miss...?"
107640,L589361,u3171,m208,MELANIE,What were the crows after at the school?
107641,L589360,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this."
107642,L589339,u3171,m208,MELANIE,These weren't a few birds.
107643,L589338,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
107644,L589337,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by."
107645,L589325,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
107646,L589324,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait."
107647,L589322,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who..."
107648,L589321,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but..."
107649,L589317,u3171,m208,MELANIE,Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
107650,L589316,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus."
107651,L589315,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by."
107652,L589314,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"There is very definitely a difference, Miss."
107653,L589313,u3171,m208,MELANIE,"No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?"
107654,L589496,u3172,m208,MITCH,Can we go on living here otherwise?
107655,L589495,u3176,m208,SHOLES,How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
107656,L589490,u3172,m208,MITCH,With smoke.
107657,L589489,u3176,m208,SHOLES,How do you plan to do that?
107658,L589486,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights."
107659,L589485,u3176,m208,SHOLES,How?
107660,L589484,u3172,m208,MITCH,I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
107661,L589481,u3176,m208,SHOLES,If you don't even know what you want to do...
107662,L589480,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I'm not sure, but..."
107663,L589479,u3176,m208,SHOLES,Help how? What do you want to do?
107664,L589478,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will."
107665,L589477,u3176,m208,SHOLES,I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...
107666,L589476,u3172,m208,MITCH,It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
107667,L589475,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it."
107668,L589474,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?"
107669,L589473,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds..."
107670,L589466,u3172,m208,MITCH,"I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it."
107671,L589465,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"No one ever said you were, Mitch."
107672,L589464,u3172,m208,MITCH,"Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist."
107673,L589457,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things."
107674,L589456,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,"They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them."
107675,L589455,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were."
107676,L589395,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
107677,L589394,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
107678,L589391,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,That would hardly be possible.
107679,L589390,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
107680,L589384,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,They are incapable of organized warfare!
107681,L589383,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,Not if they're starting a war.
107682,L589382,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,We need them.
107683,L589381,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,"Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?"
107684,L589380,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,Birds?
107685,L589372,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
107686,L589371,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,"Scotch, light on the water."
107687,L589406,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of..."
107688,L589405,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack."
107689,L589404,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,Of course.
107690,L589403,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish."
107691,L589345,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or..."
107692,L589344,u3176,m208,SHOLES,The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
107693,L589343,u3173,m208,MRS. BUNDY,"Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties."
107694,L589342,u3176,m208,SHOLES,"How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?"
107695,L589459,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,"All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks."
107696,L589458,u3177,m208,WOMAN,I'm leaving! Are you coming?
107697,L589454,u3177,m208,WOMAN,Can't you please finish your drink?
107698,L589453,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
107699,L589450,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,"Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight."
107700,L589449,u3177,m208,WOMAN,Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
107701,L589437,u3177,m208,WOMAN,Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
107702,L589436,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,I haven't finished my drink.
107703,L589435,u3177,m208,WOMAN,Then let's go. Now!
107704,L589434,u3175,m208,SALESMAN,"I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me."
107705,L589927,u3178,m209,FETTES,Good morning.
107706,L589926,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes."
107707,L589879,u3178,m209,FETTES,Good.
107708,L589878,u3180,m209,GRAY,"There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say."
107709,L589875,u3180,m209,GRAY,"How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested."
107710,L589874,u3178,m209,FETTES,But can't you give me any idea?
107711,L589873,u3180,m209,GRAY,I fear he may have to.
107712,L589751,u3180,m209,GRAY,Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
107713,L589750,u3178,m209,FETTES,Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
107714,L589749,u3180,m209,GRAY,"That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know."
107715,L589748,u3178,m209,FETTES,Mr. Gray?
107716,L589747,u3180,m209,GRAY,"I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes."
107717,L589746,u3178,m209,FETTES,I'm Donald Fettes.
107718,L590139,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,It is a pity.
107719,L590138,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession."
107720,L590132,u3178,m209,FETTES,It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
107721,L590131,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
107722,L590125,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,"Good morning, Mr. Fettes."
107723,L590124,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Good morning, Mrs. Marsh."
107724,L589830,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure."
107725,L589829,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,"-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best."
107726,L589828,u3178,m209,FETTES,Yes.
107727,L589827,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,"You have his promise, then?"
107728,L589771,u3178,m209,FETTES,Of course I will.
107729,L589770,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,Ask this one favor --
107730,L589769,u3178,m209,FETTES,I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
107731,L589768,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,Did he tell you about Georgina?
107732,L589767,u3178,m209,FETTES,"I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh."
107733,L589766,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
107734,L589765,u3178,m209,FETTES,I'm only a student.
107735,L589764,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,I want you to help my little girl.
107736,L589763,u3178,m209,FETTES,"You asked to see me, ma'am?"
107737,L590152,u3183,m209,MEG,And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
107738,L590151,u3178,m209,FETTES,At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
107739,L590150,u3183,m209,MEG,There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
107740,L590149,u3178,m209,FETTES,But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
107741,L590148,u3183,m209,MEG,You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
107742,L590147,u3178,m209,FETTES,Where can I find him?
107743,L590146,u3183,m209,MEG,He's not home.
107744,L590079,u3183,m209,MEG,It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
107745,L590078,u3178,m209,FETTES,I've heard of it.
107746,L590077,u3183,m209,MEG,"Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight."
107747,L590076,u3178,m209,FETTES,MacFarlane
107748,L590075,u3183,m209,MEG,That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
107749,L590074,u3183,m209,MEG,They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
107750,L590073,u3178,m209,FETTES,Aye.
107751,L590072,u3183,m209,MEG,And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
107752,L590071,u3178,m209,FETTES,I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
107753,L590070,u3183,m209,MEG,Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
107754,L590069,u3178,m209,FETTES,But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
107755,L590068,u3183,m209,MEG,"If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --"
107756,L590067,u3178,m209,FETTES,But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
107757,L590066,u3183,m209,MEG,I'm cold as ice.
107758,L590065,u3178,m209,FETTES,"You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron."
107759,L590064,u3183,m209,MEG,"He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death."
107760,L590063,u3183,m209,MEG,Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
107761,L590062,u3178,m209,FETTES,He's a great doctor -- a great man --
107762,L590061,u3183,m209,MEG,Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
107763,L590060,u3178,m209,FETTES,I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
107764,L590059,u3183,m209,MEG,You must leave this house.
107765,L590198,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
107766,L590197,u3178,m209,FETTES,It was a woman when we put her in.
107767,L590196,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,This is not a woman!
107768,L590185,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
107769,L590184,u3178,m209,FETTES,Where shall we put it? In the back?
107770,L590181,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
107771,L590180,u3178,m209,FETTES,No.
107772,L590179,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along."
107773,L590178,u3178,m209,FETTES,"You couldn't do that, Doctor."
107774,L590177,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
107775,L590176,u3178,m209,FETTES,You've no thought of going there?
107776,L590175,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
107777,L590174,u3178,m209,FETTES,"They'll be thinking of that, too."
107778,L590173,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles."
107779,L590172,u3178,m209,FETTES,A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
107780,L590171,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"See that, Fettes?"
107781,L590165,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Gray -- I'm rid of him --
107782,L590164,u3178,m209,FETTES,What?
107783,L590163,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
107784,L590162,u3178,m209,FETTES,The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
107785,L590161,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,What's that you say?
107786,L590054,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray."
107787,L590053,u3178,m209,FETTES,"I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane."
107788,L590052,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"What do you mean, Fettes?"
107789,L590051,u3178,m209,FETTES,No.
107790,L590050,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --"
107791,L589940,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk."
107792,L589939,u3178,m209,FETTES,But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
107793,L589938,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
107794,L589935,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me."
107795,L589934,u3178,m209,FETTES,I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
107796,L589933,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business."
107797,L589932,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people."
107798,L589931,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
107799,L589930,u3178,m209,FETTES,I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
107800,L589929,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
107801,L589928,u3178,m209,FETTES,I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
107802,L589907,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Pulse?
107803,L589906,u3178,m209,FETTES,She's unconscious.
107804,L589904,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting."
107805,L589903,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --"
107806,L589898,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock."
107807,L589897,u3178,m209,FETTES,"But, I didn't ask him to kill."
107808,L589896,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder."
107809,L589895,u3178,m209,FETTES,I can't believe that.
107810,L589894,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
107811,L589893,u3178,m209,FETTES,Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
107812,L589892,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it."
107813,L589891,u3178,m209,FETTES,I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
107814,L589890,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,We can't be sure of that.
107815,L589889,u3178,m209,FETTES,Gray killed her.
107816,L589888,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Well --
107817,L589884,u3178,m209,FETTES,This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
107818,L589883,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
107819,L589862,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
107820,L589861,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Yes, I suppose so."
107821,L589860,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You see, it is completely out of the question."
107822,L589859,u3178,m209,FETTES,Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
107823,L589858,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any ""subjects""?"
107824,L589857,u3178,m209,FETTES,But you did promise.
107825,L589856,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding."
107826,L589855,u3178,m209,FETTES,"But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her."
107827,L589854,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink."
107828,L589853,u3178,m209,FETTES,It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
107829,L589807,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
107830,L589806,u3178,m209,FETTES,She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
107831,L589805,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I remember her.
107832,L589804,u3178,m209,FETTES,Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
107833,L589791,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it."
107834,L589790,u3178,m209,FETTES,But this woman -- and her son --
107835,L589788,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane."
107836,L589787,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?"
107837,L589786,u3178,m209,FETTES,I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
107838,L589785,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --"
107839,L589784,u3178,m209,FETTES,"I don't think I can go on, sir."
107840,L589743,u3178,m209,FETTES,From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
107841,L589742,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
107842,L589731,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --"
107843,L589730,u3178,m209,FETTES,But Richardson?
107844,L589729,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Well? And are you not a good student?
107845,L589728,u3178,m209,FETTES,I thought only the best students were made assistants.
107846,L589727,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --"
107847,L589726,u3178,m209,FETTES,"I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --"
107848,L589725,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You're made for a doctor, young man!"
107849,L589724,u3178,m209,FETTES,"I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane."
107850,L589712,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Excuse me.
107851,L589711,u3178,m209,FETTES,Dr. MacFarlane --
107852,L589698,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child."
107853,L589697,u3178,m209,FETTES,"But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --"
107854,L589696,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Come in, boy -- come in."
107855,L589695,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --"
107856,L590143,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,I wanted to see the white horse --
107857,L590142,u3178,m209,FETTES,"You'll not need that again, Georgina."
107858,L590127,u3178,m209,FETTES,I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
107859,L590126,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,I thought this was a school day.
107860,L589937,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,I can't.
107861,L589936,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him."
107862,L589846,u3178,m209,FETTES,"But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?"
107863,L589845,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,I want it --
107864,L589844,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Aye, but I still wonder how much."
107865,L589842,u3178,m209,FETTES,"One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play."
107866,L589841,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
107867,L589840,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?"
107868,L589839,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,He was a nice horse.
107869,L589838,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Why do you want the white horse to bid you ""good-day""?"
107870,L589835,u3178,m209,FETTES,"An old acquaintance, eh?"
107871,L589834,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
107872,L589833,u3178,m209,FETTES,Hear him?
107873,L589705,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,Well --
107874,L589704,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Why, yes."
107875,L589703,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,"What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?"
107876,L589701,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
107877,L589700,u3178,m209,FETTES,Not yet.
107878,L589699,u3179,m209,GEORGINA,"Are you a doctor, too?"
107879,L589668,u3178,m209,FETTES,"A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --"
107880,L589667,u3184,m209,MRS. MACBRIDE,A doctor?
107881,L589666,u3178,m209,FETTES,I'm by way of being a medical myself.
107882,L589665,u3184,m209,MRS. MACBRIDE,"They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on."
107883,L589664,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh."
107884,L589662,u3178,m209,FETTES,"Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so."
107885,L589661,u3184,m209,MRS. MACBRIDE,He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
107886,L590109,u3180,m209,GRAY,"No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber."
107887,L590108,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,A pleasure to torment me?
107888,L590107,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me."
107889,L590106,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"But why, Gray? Why?"
107890,L590105,u3180,m209,GRAY,"But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy."
107891,L590104,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
107892,L590102,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
107893,L590101,u3180,m209,GRAY,"It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --"
107894,L590100,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I would make you rich.
107895,L590099,u3180,m209,GRAY,Would you bribe me to leave you be?
107896,L590098,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
107897,L590097,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
107898,L590096,u3180,m209,GRAY,I have other means of sustenance.
107899,L590095,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --"
107900,L590093,u3180,m209,GRAY,Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
107901,L590092,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I've drunk enough tonight.
107902,L590091,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Have another glass of something good, Toddy."
107903,L590090,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,We have never been friends.
107904,L590089,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy."
107905,L590086,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
107906,L590085,u3180,m209,GRAY,"So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?"
107907,L590084,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind."
107908,L590040,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!"
107909,L590039,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business."
107910,L590038,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Get out of here!
107911,L590037,u3180,m209,GRAY,This is a gift you'll not return.
107912,L590036,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I take no gifts from you.
107913,L590035,u3180,m209,GRAY,This is a gift.
107914,L590034,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I've ordered nothing from you.
107915,L590033,u3180,m209,GRAY,"I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition."
107916,L590030,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?"
107917,L590029,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,What are you going here? Have I not told you --
107918,L589984,u3180,m209,GRAY,"I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane."
107919,L589983,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me."
107920,L589982,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say."
107921,L589981,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London."
107922,L589980,u3180,m209,GRAY,"I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid."
107923,L589979,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
107924,L589977,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever."
107925,L589976,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --"
107926,L589974,u3180,m209,GRAY,"You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --"
107927,L589973,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"In the brain, I tell you. I know."
107928,L589972,u3180,m209,GRAY,But what makes a thought start?
107929,L589971,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,The nerve centers -- the brain --
107930,L589970,u3180,m209,GRAY,Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
107931,L589969,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,The heart pumps it.
107932,L589968,u3180,m209,GRAY,Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
107933,L589967,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
107934,L589966,u3180,m209,GRAY,"And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know."
107935,L589965,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
107936,L589964,u3180,m209,GRAY,"You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy."
107937,L589962,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"The same. Look here, Gray --"
107938,L589961,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about."
107939,L589960,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --"
107940,L589959,u3180,m209,GRAY,I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
107941,L589958,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?"
107942,L589957,u3180,m209,GRAY,I've had some experience.
107943,L589956,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You know something about the human body, Gray."
107944,L589954,u3180,m209,GRAY,"You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days."
107945,L589953,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me."
107946,L589919,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne."
107947,L589918,u3180,m209,GRAY,"You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know."
107948,L589917,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
107949,L589916,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly."
107950,L589824,u3180,m209,GRAY,Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
107951,L589823,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you."
107952,L589822,u3180,m209,GRAY,Toddy hates me.
107953,L589820,u3180,m209,GRAY,"That's a good boy, Toddy."
107954,L589819,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,It might be an interesting case.
107955,L589818,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here."
107956,L589817,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,No.
107957,L589816,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself."
107958,L589815,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I'll not do it, Gray."
107959,L589814,u3180,m209,GRAY,"I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any."
107960,L589813,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
107961,L589812,u3180,m209,GRAY,Why don't you do it then?
107962,L589811,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I am the best man for the job.
107963,L589810,u3180,m209,GRAY,Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
107964,L589809,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Afraid of what?
107965,L589808,u3180,m209,GRAY,"You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy."
107966,L589803,u3180,m209,GRAY,You will not have it?
107967,L589802,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,I will not have you use that name to me.
107968,L589798,u3180,m209,GRAY,Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
107969,L589797,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
107970,L589796,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend."
107971,L589795,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Don't call me that confounded name.
107972,L589794,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me."
107973,L590020,u3180,m209,GRAY,"I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they ""Burked"" them."
107974,L590019,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
107975,L590018,u3180,m209,GRAY,"""Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."""
107976,L590017,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,"We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?"
107977,L590016,u3180,m209,GRAY,"""A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like.""  Ah, how he cozened them."
107978,L590015,u3180,m209,GRAY,"That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!"
107979,L590014,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,But where did they get those people?
107980,L590013,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph."
107981,L590012,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,I never heard that song. But what did they do?
107982,L590011,u3180,m209,GRAY,"""The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"""
107983,L590010,u3180,m209,GRAY,But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
107984,L590009,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,I come from Lisbon.
107985,L590008,u3180,m209,GRAY,"You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?"
107986,L590007,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,Burke them?
107987,L590006,u3180,m209,GRAY,"No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will ""Burke"" them,"
107988,L590005,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
107989,L590004,u3180,m209,GRAY,You and I should work together.
107990,L590000,u3180,m209,GRAY,"No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's."
107991,L589999,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,"I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?"
107992,L589993,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,"Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the ""subjects."""
107993,L589992,u3180,m209,GRAY,You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
107994,L589991,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
107995,L589990,u3180,m209,GRAY,Only Brother.
107996,L589989,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,Can anyone hear what we say?
107997,L589988,u3180,m209,GRAY,"Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,"
107998,L589987,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,Yes.
107999,L589986,u3180,m209,GRAY,"You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private."
108000,L589925,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,I know --
108001,L589924,u3180,m209,GRAY,What did you hear?
108002,L589923,u3181,m209,JOSEPH,I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
108003,L589922,u3180,m209,GRAY,I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
108004,L589946,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
108005,L589945,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,She would if she could.
108006,L589944,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
108007,L589943,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,"I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move."
108008,L589723,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility."
108009,L589722,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,There's nothing I can say for one small child?
108010,L589721,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own."
108011,L589720,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,"But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --"
108012,L589719,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run."
108013,L589715,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
108014,L589714,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,But can anything be done for her?
108015,L589710,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,Three years.
108016,L589709,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,How long ago?
108017,L589708,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
108018,L589707,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?"
108019,L589688,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?"
108020,L589687,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
108021,L589686,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Is her pain sporadic or constant?
108022,L589685,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,"Yes, Doctor."
108023,L589684,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Any attacks of pain since?
108024,L589683,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,Nearly a year.
108025,L589682,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,How long after that was the paralysis complete?
108026,L589681,u3185,m209,MRS. MARSH,"No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --"
108027,L589680,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Was the paralysis immediate?
108028,L590116,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Aye.
108029,L590115,u3183,m209,MEG,You've been with Gray again.
108030,L590056,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,He must leave me alone.
108031,L590055,u3183,m209,MEG,You're not going to Gray.
108032,L590046,u3183,m209,MEG,I'll get him.
108033,L590045,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,Fettes -- where is Fettes?
108034,L590032,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,You can get out.
108035,L590031,u3183,m209,MEG,Crony indeed!
108036,L589851,u3183,m209,MEG,No great lady will ever take my place?
108037,L589850,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass."
108038,L589849,u3183,m209,MEG,"You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead."
108039,L589848,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
108040,L589737,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?"
108041,L589736,u3183,m209,MEG,Aye --
108042,L589735,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,"You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?"
108043,L589734,u3183,m209,MEG,"Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane."
108044,L589733,u3182,m209,MACFARLANE,And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
108045,L591383,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing."
108046,L591382,u3186,m210,ALEX,"Was that it? Well, ok."
108047,L591334,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
108048,L591333,u3186,m210,ALEX,You're wrong.
108049,L591332,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
108050,L591327,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong."
108051,L591326,u3186,m210,ALEX,You sent them. I had no choice.
108052,L591325,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
108053,L591321,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?"
108054,L591320,u3186,m210,ALEX,I'm looking for my friends.
108055,L591319,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?"
108056,L591317,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
108057,L591316,u3186,m210,ALEX,Where are they? Last chance.
108058,L591315,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
108059,L591314,u3186,m210,ALEX,Where are they?
108060,L591313,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,I hate that picture.
108061,L591259,u3186,m210,ALEX,What? Call the police?
108062,L591258,u3196,m210,WALSH,I think we should get some support?
108063,L591257,u3186,m210,ALEX,Where is it? This place?
108064,L591249,u3196,m210,WALSH,I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
108065,L591248,u3186,m210,ALEX,The strip joint?
108066,L591247,u3196,m210,WALSH,"We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called ""The Hole."""
108067,L591246,u3186,m210,ALEX,"Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King."
108068,L591168,u3196,m210,WALSH,Yeah. I sure will.
108069,L591167,u3186,m210,ALEX,I was hoping you'd find out.
108070,L591166,u3196,m210,WALSH,What do they do that they had to kill her?
108071,L591165,u3186,m210,ALEX,"Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out."
108072,L591164,u3196,m210,WALSH,I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
108073,L591163,u3186,m210,ALEX,You think I'm crazy.
108074,L591162,u3186,m210,ALEX,The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
108075,L591161,u3196,m210,WALSH,"""Down?"" Wait, don't tell me."
108076,L591160,u3186,m210,ALEX,Two down. Two to go.
108077,L591157,u3186,m210,ALEX,Dream on.
108078,L591156,u3196,m210,WALSH,Check and mate.
108079,L590849,u3196,m210,WALSH,Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
108080,L590848,u3186,m210,ALEX,We won't.
108081,L590847,u3196,m210,WALSH,Tell her... we'll get him.
108082,L590846,u3186,m210,ALEX,What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
108083,L591004,u3188,m210,DUTTON,"Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?"
108084,L591003,u3186,m210,ALEX,You killed her. I saw it.
108085,L591000,u3188,m210,DUTTON,"There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up."
108086,L590999,u3186,m210,ALEX,A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
108087,L590998,u3188,m210,DUTTON,Fuck! What do you want?
108088,L590996,u3186,m210,ALEX,"This is not just some ""thing."" It's A C zero zero five."
108089,L590995,u3188,m210,DUTTON,Keep that thing away from me.
108090,L590994,u3186,m210,ALEX,Think maybe knives do?
108091,L590993,u3186,m210,ALEX,I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
108092,L590992,u3188,m210,DUTTON,That was a fucking hollow point!
108093,L590964,u3193,m210,TOMMY,A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
108094,L590963,u3186,m210,ALEX,What did they give you?
108095,L590962,u3193,m210,TOMMY,"They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head ""yes."""
108096,L590961,u3186,m210,ALEX,What did they give you?
108097,L590955,u3193,m210,TOMMY,Who are you?
108098,L590954,u3186,m210,ALEX,Wrong. Answer.
108099,L590953,u3193,m210,TOMMY,There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
108100,L590952,u3186,m210,ALEX,"One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car."
108101,L590951,u3193,m210,TOMMY,"What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker."
108102,L590950,u3186,m210,ALEX,You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
108103,L590949,u3193,m210,TOMMY,Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
108104,L590948,u3186,m210,ALEX,Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
108105,L590947,u3193,m210,TOMMY,"I don't know you, man."
108106,L590946,u3186,m210,ALEX,You lied at my trial.
108107,L590945,u3186,m210,ALEX,"Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator."
108108,L590944,u3193,m210,TOMMY,Where the fuck did you come from?
108109,L590943,u3186,m210,ALEX,Sssshhh. She's resting.
108110,L591302,u3194,m210,TOOMEY,There is no scar. I'm telling you.
108111,L591301,u3186,m210,ALEX,The scar.
108112,L591300,u3194,m210,TOOMEY,Fucking Zombie.
108113,L591299,u3186,m210,ALEX,Good thing in a situation like this.
108114,L591298,u3194,m210,TOOMEY,"You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!"
108115,L591297,u3186,m210,ALEX,AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
108116,L591296,u3194,m210,TOOMEY,What Scar? What fucking scar?
108117,L591295,u3186,m210,ALEX,"We're going to play a little game called ""Who's got the Scar."""
108118,L591074,u3186,m210,ALEX,I was talking about you.
108119,L591073,u3190,m210,ERLICH,You're him. Corvis.
108120,L591072,u3186,m210,ALEX,How can you die if you're already dead?
108121,L591071,u3190,m210,ERLICH,Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
108122,L591069,u3190,m210,ERLICH,Nobody.
108123,L591068,u3186,m210,ALEX,The scar. Which of you has it?
108124,L591067,u3190,m210,ERLICH,"Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way."
108125,L591066,u3186,m210,ALEX,I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
108126,L591065,u3190,m210,ERLICH,Not my arm! What you fucking want?
108127,L591062,u3186,m210,ALEX,What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
108128,L591061,u3190,m210,ERLICH,Fuck. Me.
108129,L591058,u3186,m210,ALEX,I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
108130,L591057,u3190,m210,ERLICH,You're the guy killed Dutton.
108131,L591056,u3186,m210,ALEX,I heard you were looking for this.
108132,L591388,u3186,m210,ALEX,Erin. I'll always be with you.
108133,L591387,u3189,m210,ERIN,"In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away."
108134,L591360,u3189,m210,ERIN,No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
108135,L591359,u3186,m210,ALEX,... it connects you to me...
108136,L591256,u3189,m210,ERIN,I don't know. I found him lying there.
108137,L591255,u3186,m210,ALEX,Erin. Who?
108138,L591254,u3189,m210,ERIN,It's not. I can't take it.
108139,L591253,u3186,m210,ALEX,"It's ok, it's ok..."
108140,L591223,u3186,m210,ALEX,It's what Lauren would do.
108141,L591222,u3189,m210,ERIN,"I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back."
108142,L591221,u3189,m210,ERIN,"I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is..."
108143,L591220,u3186,m210,ALEX,"All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy."
108144,L591219,u3189,m210,ERIN,My father.
108145,L591218,u3186,m210,ALEX,"You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me..."
108146,L591217,u3186,m210,ALEX,Have to find him first.
108147,L591216,u3189,m210,ERIN,So you're going to kill him?
108148,L591215,u3186,m210,ALEX,... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
108149,L591189,u3189,m210,ERIN,I don't want to see!
108150,L591188,u3186,m210,ALEX,This tree. Here's where it happened.
108151,L591180,u3189,m210,ERIN,"Yes I do, I really do."
108152,L591179,u3186,m210,ALEX,No. You don't.
108153,L591178,u3189,m210,ERIN,It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
108154,L591177,u3186,m210,ALEX,Erin. It's not your fault.
108155,L591176,u3189,m210,ERIN,... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
108156,L591175,u3186,m210,ALEX,No...
108157,L591174,u3189,m210,ERIN,"When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you..."
108158,L591173,u3186,m210,ALEX,Are you ok?
108159,L591172,u3189,m210,ERIN,"Yeah, I know."
108160,L591171,u3186,m210,ALEX,This is where it happened. Right over here.
108161,L591089,u3186,m210,ALEX,Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
108162,L591088,u3189,m210,ERIN,No! Why are you haunting me?
108163,L591087,u3186,m210,ALEX,From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
108164,L591086,u3186,m210,ALEX,No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
108165,L591085,u3189,m210,ERIN,My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
108166,L591084,u3186,m210,ALEX,"I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why."
108167,L591082,u3189,m210,ERIN,You killed Lauren! You killed her!
108168,L591081,u3186,m210,ALEX,I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
108169,L591080,u3189,m210,ERIN,I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
108170,L591079,u3186,m210,ALEX,And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
108171,L591078,u3189,m210,ERIN,You killed that cop Dutton.
108172,L591077,u3186,m210,ALEX,"I told you, I knew your sister."
108173,L591076,u3189,m210,ERIN,Daisy. How did you know?
108174,L590934,u3189,m210,ERIN,Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
108175,L590933,u3186,m210,ALEX,I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
108176,L590932,u3189,m210,ERIN,How do you know?
108177,L590931,u3186,m210,ALEX,He didn't kill her.
108178,L590930,u3189,m210,ERIN,"You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him."
108179,L590929,u3186,m210,ALEX,Someone else did it.
108180,L590928,u3189,m210,ERIN,And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
108181,L590927,u3186,m210,ALEX,Your father gave them to both of you.
108182,L590926,u3189,m210,ERIN,"Yeah, no kidding."
108183,L590925,u3186,m210,ALEX,That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
108184,L590924,u3189,m210,ERIN,I know her friends.
108185,L590923,u3186,m210,ALEX,I was a friend of your sister's.
108186,L591354,u3191,m210,MADDEN,You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
108187,L591353,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
108188,L591347,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
108189,L591346,u3191,m210,MADDEN,Doubt is a motherfucker.
108190,L591345,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Just don't believe everything you see.
108191,L591212,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
108192,L591211,u3191,m210,MADDEN,"Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know."
108193,L591208,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that."
108194,L591207,u3191,m210,MADDEN,How about sign of a big black bird?
108195,L591206,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Sign of the dead come back to life.
108196,L591205,u3191,m210,MADDEN,Fucking crow.
108197,L591202,u3191,m210,MADDEN,Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
108198,L591201,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Could say that.
108199,L591200,u3191,m210,MADDEN,They botched the execution.
108200,L591116,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Good for you. You do know something.
108201,L591115,u3191,m210,MADDEN,Guy dressed for Halloween?
108202,L591114,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
108203,L591113,u3191,m210,MADDEN,Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
108204,L591110,u3191,m210,MADDEN,I know the guy leaves a sign.
108205,L591109,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,You know.
108206,L591108,u3191,m210,MADDEN,I know.
108207,L591107,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
108208,L591106,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Shut up.
108209,L591105,u3191,m210,MADDEN,"Yeah, we do."
108210,L591104,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
108211,L591241,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"Erin knows, doesn't she?"
108212,L591240,u3192,m210,RANDALL,I do. Every day.
108213,L591239,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
108214,L591238,u3192,m210,RANDALL,She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
108215,L591237,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"An accident, Nathan."
108216,L591236,u3192,m210,RANDALL,You killed my daughter.
108217,L591235,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
108218,L591234,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,I mean Lauren.
108219,L591233,u3192,m210,RANDALL,You mean Alex.
108220,L591232,u3187,m210,CAPTAIN,"Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us."
108221,L590981,u3188,m210,DUTTON,What did I say?
108222,L590980,u3195,m210,TRACY,"Look, can I just call a cab?"
108223,L590979,u3188,m210,DUTTON,I want you... to bend over.
108224,L590978,u3195,m210,TRACY,You want me to walk a straight line?
108225,L590975,u3195,m210,TRACY,"Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her."
108226,L590974,u3188,m210,DUTTON,"If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?"
108227,L590973,u3195,m210,TRACY,Not tonight. Honest.
108228,L590972,u3188,m210,DUTTON,"But you, you've had them."
108229,L590971,u3195,m210,TRACY,She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
108230,L590970,u3188,m210,DUTTON,What's with your friend there?
108231,L590969,u3188,m210,DUTTON,Let's hope not. License and registration please.
108232,L590968,u3195,m210,TRACY,Anything wrong?
108233,L591139,u3189,m210,ERIN,I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
108234,L591138,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Please. Come inside.
108235,L591137,u3189,m210,ERIN,I don't believe you.
108236,L591136,u3192,m210,RANDALL,I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
108237,L591135,u3189,m210,ERIN,Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
108238,L591134,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Sweetheart...
108239,L591133,u3192,m210,RANDALL,About them. You've got to leave it alone.
108240,L591132,u3189,m210,ERIN,About you.
108241,L591131,u3192,m210,RANDALL,They killed her because she found out.
108242,L591130,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
108243,L591129,u3189,m210,ERIN,Stay away from me! Stay away!
108244,L591128,u3192,m210,RANDALL,No.
108245,L591127,u3189,m210,ERIN,You killed her!
108246,L591126,u3192,m210,RANDALL,It's not what you think.
108247,L591125,u3189,m210,ERIN,You're in with them.
108248,L591123,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Looks like you have them both on.
108249,L591122,u3189,m210,ERIN,I think I dropped an earring.
108250,L591039,u3189,m210,ERIN,He said he'd prove it.
108251,L591038,u3192,m210,RANDALL,It still doesn't mean...
108252,L591037,u3189,m210,ERIN,That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
108253,L591036,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
108254,L591035,u3189,m210,ERIN,Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
108255,L591034,u3192,m210,RANDALL,What? What is it?
108256,L591030,u3189,m210,ERIN,The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
108257,L591029,u3192,m210,RANDALL,What is it?
108258,L590940,u3189,m210,ERIN,What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
108259,L590939,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Are you ok?
108260,L590938,u3189,m210,ERIN,This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
108261,L590937,u3192,m210,RANDALL,What were you yelling about?
108262,L590936,u3189,m210,ERIN,Watch out!
108263,L590935,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Erin!
108264,L590920,u3189,m210,ERIN,"It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time."
108265,L590919,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
108266,L590918,u3189,m210,ERIN,Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
108267,L590917,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Honey. I just can't.
108268,L590916,u3189,m210,ERIN,I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
108269,L590830,u3192,m210,RANDALL,Just hold on to me.
108270,L590829,u3189,m210,ERIN,Why are there so many?
108271,L591891,u3197,m211,BARNHARDT,"That's good, Hilda. I'm glad."
108272,L591890,u3202,m211,HILDA,"Yes, sir -- it certainly does!"
108273,L591889,u3197,m211,BARNHARDT,"Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?"
108274,L591888,u3202,m211,HILDA,He'll be there at 8:30.
108275,L591887,u3197,m211,BARNHARDT,Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
108276,L591886,u3202,m211,HILDA,I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
108277,L591885,u3197,m211,BARNHARDT,What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
108278,L591884,u3197,m211,BARNHARDT,What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
108279,L591883,u3202,m211,HILDA,The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
108280,L591882,u3197,m211,BARNHARDT,Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
108281,L591881,u3202,m211,HILDA,"You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!"
108282,L591774,u3204,m211,KLAATU,Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
