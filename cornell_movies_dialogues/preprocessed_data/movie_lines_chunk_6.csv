218582,L368726,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,...I'm going to see Lecktor.
218583,L368725,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,See? You do know something about him.
218584,L368724,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack."
218585,L368723,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Why?
218586,L368722,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
218587,L368721,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,No other possibilities?
218588,L368720,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
218589,L368719,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?"
218590,L368718,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him."
218591,L368717,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,What's one way?
218592,L368716,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other."
218593,L368715,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
218594,L368714,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me."
218595,L368713,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
218596,L368712,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
218597,L368711,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I know...
218598,L368710,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls..."
218599,L368695,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
218600,L368694,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
218601,L368659,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes."
218602,L368658,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,What do you want to do?
218603,L368657,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
218604,L368656,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,You said the guy down here is good.
218605,L368655,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Get him to Atlanta.
218606,L368654,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
218607,L368653,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?"
218608,L368605,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
218609,L368604,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
218610,L368603,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"These are all dead, Will."
218611,L368602,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,As long as they're dead...
218612,L368601,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"If you can't look anymore, I understand..."
218613,L368600,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I am all right.
218614,L368599,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,You look all right now.
218615,L368598,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
218616,L368597,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think."
218617,L368596,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
218618,L368595,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Last two like this we had, you caught."
218619,L368594,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack."
218620,L368593,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
218621,L368592,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
218622,L368591,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Why not?
218623,L368590,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
218624,L368589,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
218625,L368588,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
218626,L368587,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Somebody hurt him?
218627,L368586,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive."
218628,L368585,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What else did you keep out of the papers?
218629,L368584,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
218630,L368583,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
218631,L368582,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,How much do you know?
218632,L368581,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon."
218633,L368580,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
218634,L369009,u6494,m431,SARAH,They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
218635,L369008,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
218636,L368991,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Let's get to the physical.
218637,L368990,u6494,m431,SARAH,Not yet.
218638,L368897,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,For Christ's sake get him!
218639,L368896,u6494,m431,SARAH,He went to the men's room.
218640,L368895,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Where the hell's Graham!
218641,L368886,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Will. Get right back here. He just called.
218642,L368885,u6494,m431,SARAH,"He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham ""broken mirrors.""'"
218643,L368884,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?"
218644,L369451,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
218645,L369450,u6492,m431,REBA,It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
218646,L369448,u6492,m431,REBA,The Tooth...
218647,L369447,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
218648,L369446,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
218649,L369445,u6492,m431,REBA,Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
218650,L369393,u6492,m431,REBA,Francis...?
218651,L369392,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Me.
218652,L369391,u6492,m431,REBA,Who?
218653,L369390,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,It's me.
218654,L369389,u6492,m431,REBA,Who is it?
218655,L369383,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Yes.
218656,L369382,u6492,m431,REBA,You'll come by?
218657,L369381,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,I'll see you later. All right?
218658,L369380,u6492,m431,REBA,Are you okay...?
218659,L369379,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,No. Reba...?
218660,L369378,u6492,m431,REBA,"I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?"
218661,L369377,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,The developing room.  I need to... see you.
218662,L369376,u6492,m431,REBA,Francis? Where are you?
218663,L369375,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Reba...
218664,L369325,u6492,m431,REBA,"I'm fine, Francis."
218665,L369324,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?"
218666,L369323,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
218667,L369322,u6492,m431,REBA,I'll get my purse.
218668,L369321,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,I have work to do at the plant.
218669,L369320,u6492,m431,REBA,"My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?"
218670,L369319,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
218671,L369318,u6492,m431,REBA,"Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee..."
218672,L369317,u6492,m431,REBA,I'm fine.
218673,L369316,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Yes, are you okay...?!"
218674,L369315,u6492,m431,REBA,Is that you. D?
218675,L369310,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
218676,L369309,u6492,m431,REBA,That was nice of you to think of that.
218677,L369301,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,It's a surprise.
218678,L369300,u6492,m431,REBA,Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
218679,L369292,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Uh-huh.
218680,L369291,u6492,m431,REBA,I'll probably go back to it someday.
218681,L369290,u6492,m431,REBA,"You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children..."
218682,L369289,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,You worked out well.
218683,L369288,u6492,m431,REBA,They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
218684,L369287,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,How did you come to Gateway?
218685,L369286,u6492,m431,REBA,In the kitchen.
218686,L369285,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Tonic will be fine.
218687,L369284,u6492,m431,REBA,Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
218688,L369282,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
218689,L369281,u6492,m431,REBA,"Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time."
218690,L369280,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Ride with me.
218691,L369279,u6492,m431,REBA,"No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow."
218692,L369278,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,I'll take you.
218693,L369275,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,It'll do fine.
218694,L369274,u6492,m431,REBA,The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
218695,L369273,u6492,m431,REBA,Let me stick this in the black hole.
218696,L369272,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,In eight days.
218697,L369271,u6492,m431,REBA,When do you need it?
218698,L369270,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,The activities of nocturnal animals.
218699,L369269,u6492,m431,REBA,What's being photographed?
218700,L369268,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
218701,L369267,u6492,m431,REBA,Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
218702,L369266,u6492,m431,REBA,Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
218703,L369265,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock."
218704,L369374,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
218705,L369373,u6493,m431,RED DRAGON,YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
218706,L369372,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
218707,L369371,u6493,m431,RED DRAGON,SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
218708,L369370,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,No!
218709,L369369,u6493,m431,RED DRAGON,THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
218710,L369368,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,No.
218711,L369367,u6493,m431,RED DRAGON,THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
218712,L369230,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
218713,L369229,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,"Absolutely,"
218714,L369228,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,You will tell the truth?
218715,L369227,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,You'll let me go now?
218716,L369226,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
218717,L369225,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,"'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'"
218718,L369224,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
218719,L369220,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,No.
218720,L369219,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?"
218721,L369218,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,"God, no."
218722,L369217,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Do you imply that I'm a queer?
218723,L369216,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes.
218724,L369215,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Are you a man?
218725,L369214,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Not me.
218726,L369213,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,'No' what?
218727,L369212,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,"Please, no."
218728,L369211,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Do you see?
218729,L369210,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,"Oh, God."
218730,L369209,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
218731,L369208,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes.
218732,L369207,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
218733,L369206,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes.
218734,L369205,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?"
218735,L369204,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes.
218736,L369203,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Do you see?
218737,L369202,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes.
218738,L369201,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Do you see?
218739,L369200,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes...
218740,L369199,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
218741,L369196,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead."
218742,L369195,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,No. I don't want to see you.
218743,L369194,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds."
218744,L369191,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,In a little while I'll help you understand.
218745,L369190,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,I don't know...
218746,L369189,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?"
218747,L369188,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes.
218748,L369187,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?"
218749,L369186,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,I'm very scared.
218750,L369185,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Do you feel privileged?
218751,L369184,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Yes.
218752,L369183,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?"
218753,L369182,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,I don't want to know.
218754,L369181,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?"
218755,L369180,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"Atoning, Mr. Lounds."
218756,L369179,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,What am I doing here?
218757,L369178,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,"Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth."
218758,L369177,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
218759,L369176,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,"My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned."
218760,L369175,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,"No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine."
218761,L369174,u6489,m431,LOUNDS,Was I in an accident?
218762,L369173,u6481,m431,DOLLARHYDE,Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
218763,L368937,u6486,m431,GUARD,No.
218764,L368936,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
218765,L368935,u6486,m431,GUARD,Yeah. It's right here.
218766,L368934,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,Do you have it?
218767,L368933,u6486,m431,GUARD,"When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around..."
218768,L368932,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,Yes?
218769,L368931,u6486,m431,GUARD,Dr. Chilton.
218770,L368930,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,Come in.
218771,L368957,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,"Three, four hours."
218772,L368956,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
218773,L368955,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,In a holding cell.
218774,L368952,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,"It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The ""Tooth Fairy."" What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom."
218775,L368951,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Can you read it to me?
218776,L368948,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Where did you get it?!
218777,L368947,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,"Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and...."
218778,L368946,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,It's Will Graham...
218779,L368763,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,Uh... sure...
218780,L368762,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I want to see Lecktor now.
218781,L368761,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,"When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?"
218782,L368760,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
218783,L368759,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,"The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?"
218784,L368757,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
218785,L368756,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
218786,L368755,u6482,m431,DR. CHILTON,Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
218787,L368862,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Thank you very much.
218788,L368861,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,"3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida."
218789,L368860,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too"
218790,L368859,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,"Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C."
218791,L368858,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
218792,L368857,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,Okay.
218793,L368856,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G."
218794,L368855,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,Yeah...
218795,L368854,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
218796,L368853,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,She doesn't have a Rolodex.
218797,L368852,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
218798,L368851,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,"She'll be in, in the morning..."
218799,L368850,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
218800,L368849,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,Linda doesn't come in nights.
218801,L368848,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Hi, Linda. .."
218802,L368847,u6483,m431,GRADUATE STUDENT,Linda King's desk.
218803,L368919,u6498,m431,VOICE,Goodbye.
218804,L368918,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I don't want to do that,"
218805,L368917,u6498,m431,VOICE,Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
218806,L368916,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
218807,L368915,u6498,m431,VOICE,That's true.
218808,L368914,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He's very strong physically.
218809,L368913,u6498,m431,VOICE,Cut the general crap.
218810,L368912,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He's misunderstood.
218811,L368911,u6498,m431,VOICE,Most people are.
218812,L368910,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He's right-handed.
218813,L368909,u6498,m431,VOICE,I don't think I'll tell you.
218814,L368908,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
218815,L368907,u6498,m431,VOICE,You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
218816,L368906,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
218817,L368905,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
218818,L368904,u6498,m431,VOICE,Why do you think I called?
218819,L368903,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Do you know something about that?
218820,L368902,u6498,m431,VOICE,Atlanta and Birmingham.
218821,L368901,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I don't understand.
218822,L368900,u6498,m431,VOICE,No. I can help you.
218823,L368899,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
218824,L368693,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
218825,L368692,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,No.
218826,L368691,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
218827,L368690,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
218828,L368689,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What about the dog?
218829,L368688,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,I understand he cut you pretty good...
218830,L368687,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I call him a monster.
218831,L368686,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,To yourself...
218832,L368685,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,What would you call him?
218833,L368684,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
218834,L368683,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
218835,L368682,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
218836,L368681,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,What happened to them?
218837,L368680,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
218838,L368679,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,"The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?"
218839,L368675,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
218840,L368674,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,What's average?
218841,L368673,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot."
218842,L368672,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,"He only bit women so far, right?"
218843,L368671,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
218844,L368666,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
218845,L368665,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,"'Intimate? !"""
218846,L368664,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?"
218847,L368663,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,Why do you think he took his gloves off?
218848,L368662,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
218849,L368661,u6496,m431,SPRINGFIELD,Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
218850,L369533,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You got a deal...
218851,L369532,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Let's forget who said what to whom...
218852,L369516,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around."
218853,L369515,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Maybe we should give it some time...
218854,L369514,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
218855,L369513,u6490,m431,MOLLY,That's not true.
218856,L369512,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me..."
218857,L369511,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Will?  You could come up here.
218858,L369510,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Small difference: I'm not dead, yet."
218859,L369509,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too."
218860,L369508,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"What's the problem, Molly?"
218861,L369507,u6490,m431,MOLLY,It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
218862,L369506,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What's this Mama shit?
218863,L369505,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days..."
218864,L369504,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Come home with me.
218865,L369503,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
218866,L369502,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
218867,L369501,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"I want to see you, too."
218868,L369500,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
218869,L369499,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Will? Are you okay?
218870,L369498,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Mama was probably asleep.
218871,L369497,u6490,m431,MOLLY,I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
218872,L369496,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Hello.
218873,L369252,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Will...
218874,L369251,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
218875,L369249,u6490,m431,MOLLY,William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
218876,L369248,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
218877,L369247,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Is Crawford going with you?
218878,L369246,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I have to go back to Birmingham.
218879,L369245,u6490,m431,MOLLY,What will you do?
218880,L369244,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
218881,L369243,u6490,m431,MOLLY,And... where are things?
218882,L369242,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
218883,L369241,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Can you quit?
218884,L369240,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
218885,L369239,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Then why?
218886,L369238,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
218887,L369237,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
218888,L369236,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"I'd like one of your cigarettes, please."
218889,L369235,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You haven't smoked in two years.
218890,L369234,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Can I have one of your cigarettes?
218891,L369097,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes. I said this is too good to live...
218892,L369096,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Do you remember what you said?
218893,L369095,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I remember.
218894,L369094,u6490,m431,MOLLY,You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
218895,L369061,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping."
218896,L369060,u6490,m431,MOLLY,He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
218897,L369056,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?"
218898,L369055,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you."
218899,L368751,u6490,m431,MOLLY,I love you...
218900,L368750,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby..."
218901,L368748,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and..."
218902,L368747,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Blue is cold.
218903,L368746,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Blue, then."
218904,L368745,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
218905,L368744,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow."
218906,L368743,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?"
218907,L368742,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I have to see somebody.
218908,L368741,u6490,m431,MOLLY,To do what?
218909,L368740,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
218910,L368739,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered."
218911,L368738,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it..."
218912,L368737,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
218913,L368736,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
218914,L368735,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Which part? That or the day-to-day.
218915,L368734,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Tell me about yourself.
218916,L368733,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"Me, too. And very erotic..."
218917,L368732,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
218918,L368731,u6490,m431,MOLLY,At the store. You doin' some good?
218919,L368730,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Hey, baby! Where are you?"
218920,L368729,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"Hello, hotshot!"
218921,L368651,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night."
218922,L368650,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you..."
218923,L368649,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Huh?  Will? Is that you?
218924,L368648,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Molly?
218925,L368619,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence."
218926,L368618,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?"
218927,L368617,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,If I were?
218928,L368616,u6490,m431,MOLLY,What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
218929,L368615,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What the hell can I do?
218930,L368614,u6490,m431,MOLLY,All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
218931,L368613,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"We have it good, don't we?"
218932,L368612,u6490,m431,MOLLY,You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
218933,L368611,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything."
218934,L368610,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone."
218935,L368609,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,And you said?
218936,L368608,u6490,m431,MOLLY,He asked how you are.
218937,L368607,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What did he want?
218938,L368606,u6490,m431,MOLLY,He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
218939,L369346,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Tell her I called.
218940,L369345,u6485,m431,GRAMPA,What's that?
218941,L369344,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I know... 'Out in the good air...'
218942,L369343,u6485,m431,GRAMPA,My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
218943,L369342,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes. Is Molly there?
218944,L369341,u6485,m431,GRAMPA,You going back down to Florida after?
218945,L369340,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too..."
218946,L369339,u6485,m431,GRAMPA,"Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?"
218947,L369338,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?"
218948,L369479,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Go on to the house...
218949,L369478,u6491,m431,OFFICER,Lt. Fisk said...
218950,L369477,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Go on to the house.
218951,L369476,u6491,m431,OFFICER,Meet point's up ahead!
218952,L368640,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Thanks.
218953,L368639,u6491,m431,OFFICER,"There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS."
218954,L368638,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,That's right.
218955,L368637,u6491,m431,OFFICER,"I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone."
218956,L368636,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Thanks for the lift.
218957,L369530,u6495,m431,SHERMAN,"I can't thank you enough, I..."
218958,L369529,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and..."
218959,L369528,u6495,m431,SHERMAN,"We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?"
218960,L369526,u6495,m431,SHERMAN,"Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!"
218961,L369525,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,My name's Will Graham. I...
218962,L369524,u6495,m431,SHERMAN,Yes. Who are you?
218963,L369523,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Are you George Sherman?
218964,L369522,u6495,m431,SHERMAN,What do you want?
218965,L369089,u6487,m431,KEVIN,"You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?"
218966,L369088,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Huh?
218967,L369087,u6487,m431,KEVIN,What kind of coffee do you like?
218968,L369084,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,...yes.
218969,L369083,u6487,m431,KEVIN,And Hobbs died?
218970,L369082,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,...after a while.
218971,L369081,u6487,m431,KEVIN,She got all right?
218972,L369080,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
218973,L369079,u6487,m431,KEVIN,Did the girl die?
218974,L369077,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
218975,L369076,u6487,m431,KEVIN,You went in the apartment?
218976,L369075,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait."
218977,L369074,u6487,m431,KEVIN,How?
218978,L369073,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
218979,L369072,u6487,m431,KEVIN,How did it happen?
218980,L369071,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
218981,L369070,u6487,m431,KEVIN,Are you gonna kill him?
218982,L369069,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,We don't know that.
218983,L369068,u6487,m431,KEVIN,"I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?"
218984,L369067,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?"
218985,L369066,u6487,m431,KEVIN,I figured I'd ask you...
218986,L369065,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes.
218987,L369064,u6487,m431,KEVIN,Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
218988,L369063,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
218989,L369062,u6487,m431,KEVIN,Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
218990,L369059,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?"
218991,L369058,u6487,m431,KEVIN,"I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom..."
218992,L369057,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
218993,L368625,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed."
218994,L368624,u6487,m431,KEVIN,"Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?"
218995,L368623,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
218996,L368622,u6487,m431,KEVIN,How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
218997,L368621,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yeah...
218998,L368620,u6487,m431,KEVIN,Will it keep them out?
218999,L369360,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful..."
219000,L369359,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Why does it feel good?
219001,L369358,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders."
219002,L369357,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I don't believe in God.
219003,L369356,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!"
219004,L369355,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Fight what?
219005,L369354,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?"
219006,L369353,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it."
219007,L369352,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
219008,L369351,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What do you want?
219009,L369350,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will."
219010,L368830,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file."
219011,L368829,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Do you know how you caught me, Will?"
219012,L368828,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
219013,L368827,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?"
219014,L368826,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I haven't decided yet.
219015,L368825,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,May I keep the file?
219016,L368824,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
219017,L368823,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,I don't have one right now.
219018,L368822,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I want your opinion.
219019,L368821,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?"
219020,L368820,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes. I'd considered it.
219021,L368819,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
219022,L368818,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,That's interesting.
219023,L368817,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing."
219024,L368816,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?"
219025,L368815,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,What were the yards like?
219026,L368812,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
219027,L368811,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor."
219028,L368810,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Do you dream much, Will?"
219029,L368809,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
219030,L368808,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Let me have them, and I might consider it."
219031,L368807,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes.
219032,L368806,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Pictures?
219033,L368805,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes.
219034,L368804,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Do you have the file with you
219035,L368803,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best..."
219036,L368802,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
219037,L368800,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"You're very tan, Will."
219038,L368799,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You're insane.
219039,L368798,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,What disadvantage?
219040,L368797,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You had disadvantages.
219041,L368796,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Then how did you catch me, Will?"
219042,L368795,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
219043,L368794,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me."
219044,L368793,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
219045,L368792,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Pray tell.
219046,L368791,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
219047,L368790,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring."
219048,L368789,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
219049,L368788,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Why should I tell you?
219050,L368787,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I thought you would have some ideas.
219051,L368786,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?"
219052,L368785,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"You read about it, I'm sure."
219053,L368784,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Yes.
219054,L368783,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
219055,L368782,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Yes, I thought so."
219056,L368781,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor."
219057,L368780,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"It doesn't matter to me, Will."
219058,L368779,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
219059,L368778,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
219060,L368777,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You've read the transcript. It's all there.
219061,L368776,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'"
219062,L368775,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Very interesting, even to a layman."
219063,L368774,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,And?
219064,L368773,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
219065,L368772,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot."
219066,L368771,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
219067,L368770,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,"Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?"
219068,L368769,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Stuart is fine.
219069,L368768,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
219070,L368767,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I got it. Thank you.
219071,L368766,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,Did you get my card?
219072,L368765,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I keep getting it for Christmas.
219073,L368764,u6488,m431,LECKTOR,That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
219074,L369151,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Let's walk the route.
219075,L369150,u6497,m431,SPURGEN,You got it.
219076,L369149,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
219077,L369148,u6497,m431,SPURGEN,I hope you have a second chance...
219078,L369147,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Kevlar Second Chance.
219079,L369146,u6497,m431,SPURGEN,...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
219080,L369145,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Glaser Safety Slugs?
219081,L369144,u6497,m431,SPURGEN,"Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?"
219082,L369143,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Yes.
219083,L369142,u6497,m431,SPURGEN,"I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog."
219084,L369141,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Pretty well.
219085,L369140,u6497,m431,SPURGEN,"...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?"
219086,L370302,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!"
219087,L370301,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Really?
219088,L370300,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer."
219089,L370299,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
219090,L370295,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Yeah...
219091,L370294,u6499,m432,ANDY,My hair is coming out.
219092,L370293,u6502,m432,GEORGE,You've got good days and bad days.
219093,L370292,u6499,m432,ANDY,I can't move my arm.
219094,L370257,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!"
219095,L370256,u6502,m432,GEORGE,You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
219096,L370255,u6499,m432,ANDY,Tony Clifton.
219097,L370254,u6502,m432,GEORGE,So who's gonna pay for it?
219098,L370253,u6499,m432,ANDY,I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
219099,L370241,u6499,m432,ANDY,No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
219100,L370240,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Do you wanna tour the clubs?
219101,L370239,u6499,m432,ANDY,I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
219102,L370238,u6502,m432,GEORGE,So how can I help you...?
219103,L370237,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead."
219104,L370236,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy."
219105,L370235,u6499,m432,ANDY,Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
219106,L370234,u6502,m432,GEORGE,You must take a little pleasure in it.
219107,L370231,u6499,m432,ANDY,It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
219108,L370230,u6502,m432,GEORGE,What was that all about?
219109,L370197,u6499,m432,ANDY,I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
219110,L370196,u6502,m432,GEORGE,That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
219111,L370195,u6499,m432,ANDY,"No, it's true.  I have lung cancer."
219112,L370184,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you."
219113,L370183,u6499,m432,ANDY,The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
219114,L370159,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
219115,L370158,u6499,m432,ANDY,Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
219116,L370134,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
219117,L370133,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount..."
219118,L370127,u6502,m432,GEORGE,You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
219119,L370126,u6499,m432,ANDY,We were just trying to push the envelope --
219120,L369999,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings."
219121,L369998,u6499,m432,ANDY,"What, you don't think I can beat him?"
219122,L369997,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  ""Here I come to save the day!""?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!"
219123,L369941,u6499,m432,ANDY,"That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!"
219124,L369940,u6502,m432,GEORGE,WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
219125,L369939,u6499,m432,ANDY,They're having a laugh...
219126,L369938,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back."
219127,L369937,u6499,m432,ANDY,"That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this."
219128,L369914,u6502,m432,GEORGE,But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
219129,L369913,u6499,m432,ANDY,"George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them."
219130,L369908,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"""Funny""?  I dunno.  But ""intriguing""... ""mindboggling""... perhaps ""headache-inducing""... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage..."
219131,L369907,u6499,m432,ANDY,But wasn't it funny?
219132,L369906,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: ""Look, Dad, I got an F!"""
219133,L369848,u6502,m432,GEORGE,There'll be other shots.
219134,L369847,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break."
219135,L369843,u6499,m432,ANDY,Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
219136,L369842,u6502,m432,GEORGE,I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
219137,L369841,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!"
219138,L369840,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?"
219139,L369839,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!"
219140,L369807,u6502,m432,GEORGE,I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
219141,L369806,u6499,m432,ANDY,How long would they let me sleep?
219142,L369805,u6502,m432,GEORGE,And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
219143,L369804,u6499,m432,ANDY,"But George, I like to push the boundaries..."
219144,L369803,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!"
219145,L369801,u6502,m432,GEORGE,You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
219146,L369800,u6499,m432,ANDY,"I'm sorry, George..."
219147,L369776,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!"
219148,L369775,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months."
219149,L369774,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Yeah, we can have a garage sale. ""Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"""
219150,L369773,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --"
219151,L369772,u6499,m432,ANDY,The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
219152,L369771,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --"
219153,L369711,u6499,m432,ANDY,What's up?
219154,L369710,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Andy!
219155,L369677,u6502,m432,GEORGE,That's alright.  Where...?
219156,L369676,u6499,m432,ANDY,Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
219157,L369675,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?"
219158,L369674,u6499,m432,ANDY,Hi George!
219159,L369673,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Andy?
219160,L369664,u6499,m432,ANDY,He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
219161,L369663,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- ""two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton""??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!"
219162,L369662,u6499,m432,ANDY,Those are my terms.
219163,L369661,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
219164,L369659,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
219165,L369658,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms."
219166,L369657,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!"
219167,L369656,u6499,m432,ANDY,I refuse.
219168,L369655,u6502,m432,GEORGE,You have to do it.
219169,L369654,u6499,m432,ANDY,I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
219170,L369653,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--"
219171,L369652,u6499,m432,ANDY,"I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter."
219172,L369651,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
219173,L369650,u6499,m432,ANDY,No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
219174,L369649,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"""No""?  ""No"" to which part??"
219175,L369648,u6499,m432,ANDY,No.
219176,L369647,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  ""Latka,"" a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!"
219177,L369646,u6499,m432,ANDY,"George, I hate sitcoms."
219178,L369645,u6499,m432,ANDY,I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
219179,L369644,u6502,m432,GEORGE,And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
219180,L369643,u6499,m432,ANDY,Sitcom...?
219181,L369642,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!"
219182,L369641,u6499,m432,ANDY,The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
219183,L369640,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!"
219184,L369601,u6499,m432,ANDY,I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
219185,L369600,u6502,m432,GEORGE,You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
219186,L369599,u6499,m432,ANDY,I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
219187,L369598,u6502,m432,GEORGE,People love... comedians.
219188,L369594,u6499,m432,ANDY,"It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk."
219189,L369593,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
219190,L369592,u6499,m432,ANDY,No.  Caspiar.
219191,L369591,u6502,m432,GEORGE,So I understand you're from Lithuania?
219192,L369590,u6499,m432,ANDY,Tank you veddy much.
219193,L369589,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Hey, I really enjoyed your set."
219194,L369571,u6507,m432,MANAGER,"Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' ""Pop Goes The Weasel."""
219195,L369570,u6499,m432,ANDY,I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
219196,L369569,u6507,m432,MANAGER,Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
219197,L369568,u6499,m432,ANDY,"What do you want?  ""Take my wife, please""??"
219198,L369567,u6507,m432,MANAGER,Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
219199,L369566,u6499,m432,ANDY,You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
219200,L369565,u6507,m432,MANAGER,"Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go..."
219201,L369564,u6499,m432,ANDY,"So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?"
219202,L370083,u6499,m432,ANDY,"But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!"
219203,L370082,u6512,m432,STANLEY,"Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!"
219204,L370081,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in."
219205,L370080,u6512,m432,STANLEY,B-but... we saw... your neck...
219206,L370074,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in."
219207,L370073,u6512,m432,STANLEY,B-but... we saw... your neck...
219208,L369551,u6512,m432,STANLEY,No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
219209,L369550,u6499,m432,ANDY,B-but I have them.
219210,L369549,u6512,m432,STANLEY,"You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!"
219211,L369548,u6499,m432,ANDY,"But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five."
219212,L369546,u6499,m432,ANDY,Oh!
219213,L369545,u6512,m432,STANLEY,Andy!
219214,L369544,u6499,m432,ANDY,Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
219215,L370046,u6499,m432,ANDY,"These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis..."
219216,L370045,u6508,m432,MAYNARD,Cue the commercial!
219217,L370040,u6508,m432,MAYNARD,"Okay, great!  So let's reset!"
219218,L370039,u6499,m432,ANDY,Right...
219219,L369741,u6499,m432,ANDY,Deal.
219220,L369740,u6508,m432,MAYNARD,Ten.
219221,L369739,u6499,m432,ANDY,Twenty!
219222,L369738,u6508,m432,MAYNARD,Five.
219223,L369737,u6499,m432,ANDY,But it's only for thirty seconds!
219224,L369736,u6508,m432,MAYNARD,Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
219225,L369735,u6499,m432,ANDY,But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
219226,L369734,u6508,m432,MAYNARD,Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
219227,L369753,u6499,m432,ANDY,"I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???"
219228,L369752,u6509,m432,MIMI,I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
219229,L369751,u6499,m432,ANDY,What do you mean?
219230,L369750,u6509,m432,MIMI,I don't wanna talk about it!
219231,L369749,u6499,m432,ANDY,"No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling."
219232,L369748,u6509,m432,MIMI,What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
219233,L369747,u6499,m432,ANDY,Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
219234,L369746,u6509,m432,MIMI,Excuse me -- ?
219235,L370210,u6499,m432,ANDY,Okay.  You're probably right.
219236,L370209,u6506,m432,LYNNE,You're NOT DYING!
219237,L370208,u6499,m432,ANDY,Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
219238,L370207,u6506,m432,LYNNE,How can you be so casual??!
219239,L370201,u6499,m432,ANDY,"No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times."
219240,L370200,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Have you told your family?
219241,L370199,u6499,m432,ANDY,They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
219242,L370198,u6506,m432,LYNNE,"Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?"
219243,L370155,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Andy... there is no real you.
219244,L370154,u6499,m432,ANDY,You don't know the real me.
219245,L370153,u6506,m432,LYNNE,"Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated."
219246,L370152,u6499,m432,ANDY,I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
219247,L370151,u6506,m432,LYNNE,I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
219248,L370150,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Oh, it's open."
219249,L370149,u6506,m432,LYNNE,It's me.
219250,L370148,u6499,m432,ANDY,Go away.
219251,L369995,u6499,m432,ANDY,I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
219252,L369994,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
219253,L369993,u6499,m432,ANDY,I can shtop whenever I want...
219254,L369992,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
219255,L369979,u6506,m432,LYNNE,No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
219256,L369978,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!"
219257,L369975,u6499,m432,ANDY,If you want...
219258,L369974,u6506,m432,LYNNE,And all this will be for real?
219259,L369973,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???"
219260,L369972,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Why Memphis?
219261,L369971,u6499,m432,ANDY,Yes.
219262,L369970,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
219263,L369969,u6499,m432,ANDY,Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
219264,L369968,u6506,m432,LYNNE,"I'm here, ain't I?"
219265,L369967,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you."
219266,L369966,u6506,m432,LYNNE,You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
219267,L369965,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves."
219268,L369964,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
219269,L369962,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through ""On Golden Pond."""
219270,L369961,u6506,m432,LYNNE,"Andy, the theater's that way!"
219271,L369960,u6499,m432,ANDY,"I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter."
219272,L369959,u6506,m432,LYNNE,No thanks.
219273,L369958,u6499,m432,ANDY,Popcorn?
219274,L369957,u6499,m432,ANDY,"No, I'm sure we'll be fine."
219275,L369956,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Hi... am I late?
219276,L369955,u6499,m432,ANDY,Hi...
219277,L369954,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY"
219278,L369953,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
219279,L369951,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through ""On Golden Pond."""
219280,L369950,u6506,m432,LYNNE,"Andy, the theater's that way!"
219281,L369949,u6499,m432,ANDY,"I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter."
219282,L369948,u6506,m432,LYNNE,No thanks.
219283,L369947,u6499,m432,ANDY,Popcorn?
219284,L369946,u6499,m432,ANDY,"No, I'm sure we'll be fine."
219285,L369945,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Hi... am I late?
219286,L369944,u6499,m432,ANDY,Hi...
219287,L369934,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
219288,L369933,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd."
219289,L369932,u6506,m432,LYNNE,Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
219290,L369931,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!"
219291,L370032,u6499,m432,ANDY,DON'T TOUCH ME!
219292,L370031,u6503,m432,JACK BURNS,GET OFF!
219293,L370030,u6499,m432,ANDY,I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
219294,L370029,u6503,m432,JACK BURNS,"Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!"
219295,L370005,u6499,m432,ANDY,But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
219296,L370004,u6503,m432,JACK BURNS,Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
219297,L370003,u6499,m432,ANDY,You're not listening to me --
219298,L370002,u6503,m432,JACK BURNS,"Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  ""Maui?  ""Wowie!"""
219299,L370001,u6499,m432,ANDY,I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
219300,L370120,u6499,m432,ANDY,And you're just poor white trash!
219301,L370119,u6505,m432,LAWLER,Then your father's a wimp.
219302,L370118,u6499,m432,ANDY,My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
219303,L370117,u6505,m432,LAWLER,You're a wimp.
219304,L370116,u6499,m432,ANDY,T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
219305,L370112,u6499,m432,ANDY,And you're just poor white trash!
219306,L370111,u6505,m432,LAWLER,Then your father's a wimp.
219307,L370110,u6499,m432,ANDY,My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
219308,L370109,u6505,m432,LAWLER,You're a wimp.
219309,L370108,u6499,m432,ANDY,T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
219310,L370251,u6499,m432,ANDY,No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
219311,L370250,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"And you say, ""Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?""  And he says, ""Cancer!"""
219312,L370249,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!"
219313,L370248,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80."
219314,L370247,u6499,m432,ANDY,This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
219315,L370182,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Yeah, exactly -- ""was""!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???"
219316,L370181,u6499,m432,ANDY,I was very original!
219317,L370178,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
219318,L370177,u6499,m432,ANDY,Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
219319,L370176,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes..."
219320,L370175,u6499,m432,ANDY,"I, I was asked to do this material - -"
219321,L370174,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Yeah, my problem is you're tired."
219322,L370173,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Sir, do you have a problem?"
219323,L370095,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,It's working for Elvis.
219324,L370094,u6499,m432,ANDY,"It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me."
219325,L370093,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"""... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi""..."
219326,L369919,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!"
219327,L369918,u6499,m432,ANDY,"You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler..."
219328,L369917,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"What is this, World War Two...?"
219329,L369916,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!"
219330,L369881,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!"
219331,L369880,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"""Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"""
219332,L369814,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
219333,L369813,u6499,m432,ANDY,It's so dirty.
219334,L369812,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"She'll say, ""Now my son is a man."""
219335,L369811,u6499,m432,ANDY,I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
219336,L369783,u6499,m432,ANDY,They're asking for it.
219337,L369782,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"No!  Andy, don't do it --"
219338,L369781,u6499,m432,ANDY,Give me the book.
219339,L369723,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!"
219340,L369722,u6499,m432,ANDY,So?  What do they know?
219341,L369721,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
219342,L369720,u6499,m432,ANDY,Each show is worse than the next.
219343,L369719,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,What?!?
219344,L369718,u6499,m432,ANDY,I'm gonna quit.
219345,L369705,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years."
219346,L369704,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Hey Andy, good show."
219347,L370147,u6514,m432,YOGI,"Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here."
219348,L370146,u6499,m432,ANDY,So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
219349,L370145,u6514,m432,YOGI,It is apparently not working.
219350,L370144,u6499,m432,ANDY,Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
219351,L370142,u6514,m432,YOGI,The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
219352,L370141,u6499,m432,ANDY,"""Philosophically""?"
219353,L370140,u6514,m432,YOGI,Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
219354,L370139,u6499,m432,ANDY,Why??  I... I attend every year.
219355,L370138,u6514,m432,YOGI,This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
219356,L370137,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Yes, your Holiness?"
219357,L370136,u6514,m432,YOGI,"Excuse me, Andy..."
219358,L369629,u6514,m432,YOGI,We are all impressed.
219359,L369628,u6499,m432,ANDY,I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
219360,L369627,u6514,m432,YOGI,Goals are important.
219361,L369626,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here."
219362,L369625,u6514,m432,YOGI,Are you at peace with your family?
219363,L370091,u6499,m432,ANDY,"Doctor, I think I need a neck brace."
219364,L370090,u6510,m432,OLD DOCTOR,It's probably just a strained muscle.
219365,L370089,u6499,m432,ANDY,But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
219366,L370088,u6510,m432,OLD DOCTOR,Positive.
219367,L370087,u6499,m432,ANDY,Are you sure?
219368,L370086,u6510,m432,OLD DOCTOR,"I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman."
219369,L369897,u6500,m432,BOOKER,"Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!"
219370,L369896,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!"
219371,L369895,u6500,m432,BOOKER,"Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --"
219372,L369894,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!"
219373,L369891,u6500,m432,BOOKER,I'll take my chances!!
219374,L369890,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY."
219375,L369889,u6500,m432,BOOKER,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!"
219376,L369888,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
219377,L369887,u6500,m432,BOOKER,"Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman."
219378,L369886,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
219379,L369885,u6500,m432,BOOKER,Oh.
219380,L369884,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
219381,L369858,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
219382,L369857,u6501,m432,ED,Get off my stage!  You're fired!
219383,L369856,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places."
219384,L369855,u6501,m432,ED,Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
219385,L369854,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
219386,L369853,u6501,m432,ED,We had a deal!!
219387,L369846,u6501,m432,ED,"Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him."
219388,L369845,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"""Burlesque""?"
219389,L369617,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!"
219390,L369616,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Look... I don't know what your problem is...
219391,L369615,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
219392,L369614,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!"
219393,L369613,u6502,m432,GEORGE,Can I help you with something?
219394,L369612,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"""Speaking""!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!"
219395,L369611,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Er, yes.  Speaking."
219396,L369610,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?"
219397,L370307,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry."
219398,L370306,u6502,m432,GEORGE,It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
219399,L370205,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
219400,L370204,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you."
219401,L370192,u6502,m432,GEORGE,FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
219402,L370191,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die..."
219403,L370180,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,I used to think you were original.
219404,L370179,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Why...?  Andy, why...?"
219405,L370097,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,"Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!"
219406,L370096,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  ""It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."""
219407,L369912,u6502,m432,GEORGE,But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
219408,L369911,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
219409,L369910,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you."
219410,L369810,u6502,m432,GEORGE,"Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice..."
219411,L369809,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
219412,L369808,u6502,m432,GEORGE,I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
219413,L369708,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,Don't believe everything you hear.
219414,L369707,u6502,m432,GEORGE,So your name's not Gorsky.
219415,L369706,u6515,m432,ZMUDA,That was a really hot house!
219416,L370067,u6512,m432,STANLEY,Why isn't he MOVING??
219417,L370066,u6504,m432,JANICE,JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
219418,L370054,u6512,m432,STANLEY,They're gonna lynch him!
219419,L370053,u6504,m432,JANICE,Why is he saying these things?!
219420,L370049,u6512,m432,STANLEY,Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
219421,L370048,u6504,m432,JANICE,What's in Memphis?
219422,L370017,u6512,m432,STANLEY,He said he's coming back!
219423,L370016,u6504,m432,JANICE,Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
219424,L370011,u6504,m432,JANICE,There!
219425,L370010,u6512,m432,STANLEY,Where?
219426,L370009,u6504,m432,JANICE,I saw Michael!
219427,L369542,u6504,m432,JANICE,"Of course he's in his room.  All his ""friends"" are in there."
219428,L369541,u6512,m432,STANLEY,Is he in his room?
219429,L369698,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!"
219430,L369697,u6511,m432,SAD SACK,A -- a tourist.
219431,L369696,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
219432,L369695,u6511,m432,SAD SACK,It's my name.
219433,L369694,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!"
219434,L369693,u6511,m432,SAD SACK,Yes.
219435,L369692,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"""Gorsky""?  What is that, Polish?"
219436,L369691,u6511,m432,SAD SACK,Bob Gorsky.
219437,L369690,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,"""Bob""?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?"
219438,L369689,u6511,m432,SAD SACK,Bob.
219439,L369688,u6513,m432,TONY CLIFTON,What's your name?
219440,L369687,u6511,m432,SAD SACK,Sure...
219441,L373507,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,Know what?
219442,L373506,u6516,m433,AGENT JONES,You don't know.
219443,L373444,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
219444,L373443,u6516,m433,AGENT JONES,They are dead.  In either case --
219445,L372816,u6516,m433,AGENT JONES,It's already begun.
219446,L372815,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,We'll need a search running.
219447,L372814,u6516,m433,AGENT JONES,Their next target.  The name is Neo.
219448,L372813,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
219449,L372812,u6516,m433,AGENT JONES,He'll be contacting us again.
219450,L372811,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
219451,L372810,u6516,m433,AGENT JONES,Then the informant is real.
219452,L373358,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,You all look the same to me.
219453,L373357,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
219454,L373356,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,And you are?
219455,L373355,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
219456,L373350,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,They won't make it.
219457,L373349,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Hurry!
219458,L373348,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,The sewers.  Of course.
219459,L372797,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,"No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead."
219460,L372796,u6521,m433,LIEUTENANT,I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
219461,L372794,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,The orders were for your protection.
219462,L372793,u6521,m433,LIEUTENANT,I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
219463,L372792,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,"Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --"
219464,L372791,u6521,m433,LIEUTENANT,Oh shit.
219465,L372790,u6517,m433,AGENT SMITH,Lieutenant?
219466,L373397,u6525,m433,SWITCH,"Oh, God."
219467,L373396,u6518,m433,APOC,What?!
219468,L373310,u6518,m433,APOC,Should Tank I.D. it?
219469,L373309,u6525,m433,SWITCH,That's the third white van I've seen.
219470,L373308,u6518,m433,APOC,What?
219471,L373307,u6525,m433,SWITCH,Weird.
219472,L373109,u6518,m433,APOC,No way.  Not possible.
219473,L373108,u6525,m433,SWITCH,He's gonna make it.
219474,L372833,u6519,m433,CHOI,All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
219475,L372832,u6523,m433,NEO,You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
219476,L372831,u6523,m433,NEO,I don't know... My computer...
219477,L372830,u6519,m433,CHOI,"Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual."
219478,L372829,u6523,m433,NEO,Right...
219479,L372828,u6519,m433,CHOI,"I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist."
219480,L372827,u6523,m433,NEO,If you get caught using that --
219481,L372826,u6519,m433,CHOI,"Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!"
219482,L372824,u6519,m433,CHOI,Two grand.
219483,L372823,u6523,m433,NEO,You got the money?
219484,L372822,u6519,m433,CHOI,I know.  It's her fault.
219485,L372821,u6523,m433,NEO,You're two hours late.
219486,L372820,u6519,m433,CHOI,It's Choi.
219487,L372819,u6523,m433,NEO,Who is it?
219488,L373413,u6520,m433,CYPHER,No!
219489,L373412,u6527,m433,TRINITY,... yes.
219490,L373408,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you."
219491,L373407,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Goddamn you, Cypher!"
219492,L373405,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream."
219493,L373404,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back."
219494,L373402,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die."
219495,L373401,u6527,m433,TRINITY,The Matrix isn't real!
219496,L373400,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix."
219497,L373399,u6527,m433,TRINITY,My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
219498,L373398,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit."
219499,L373395,u6527,m433,TRINITY,You killed them.
219500,L373394,u6520,m433,CYPHER,You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
219501,L373392,u6527,m433,TRINITY,An accident?!
219502,L373391,u6520,m433,CYPHER,He had an accident.
219503,L373390,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Cypher?  Where's Tank?
219504,L373389,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Hello, Trinity."
219505,L373128,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
219506,L373127,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know."
219507,L373126,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Don't tell me you're a believer now?
219508,L373125,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"There's something about him, isn't there?"
219509,L372786,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Yeah, 'course I'm sure."
219510,L372785,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Are you sure this line is clean?
219511,L372784,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Hear what?
219512,L372783,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Did you hear that?
219513,L372782,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to."
219514,L372781,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus."
219515,L372780,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"You don't, do you?"
219516,L372779,u6527,m433,TRINITY,I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
219517,L372778,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Do you?
219518,L372777,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Morpheus believes he is the One.
219519,L372776,u6520,m433,CYPHER,We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
219520,L372775,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Don't be ridiculous.
219521,L372773,u6527,m433,TRINITY,I know but I felt like taking a shift.
219522,L372772,u6520,m433,CYPHER,You weren't supposed to relieve me.
219523,L373187,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Any time.
219524,L373186,u6523,m433,NEO,Thanks... for the drink.
219525,L373184,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off."
219526,L373183,u6523,m433,NEO,How?
219527,L373182,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Dead.  All dead.
219528,L373181,u6523,m433,NEO,What happened to them?
219529,L373180,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Five.  Since I've been here.
219530,L373179,u6523,m433,NEO,How many were there?
219531,L373178,u6520,m433,CYPHER,You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
219532,L373177,u6523,m433,NEO,Really?
219533,L373176,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One."
219534,L373175,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
219535,L373174,u6523,m433,NEO,... Yeah.
219536,L373173,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Why you're here?
219537,L373168,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?"
219538,L373167,u6523,m433,NEO,Do you always look at it encoded?
219539,L373166,u6520,m433,CYPHER,The Matrix?  Yeah.
219540,L373165,u6523,m433,NEO,Is that...?
219541,L373164,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Midnight watch.
219542,L373163,u6523,m433,NEO,What are you doing?
219543,L373162,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"No, it's all right."
219544,L373161,u6523,m433,NEO,Sorry.
219545,L373160,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me."
219546,L373057,u6520,m433,CYPHER,He's going to pop!
219547,L373056,u6523,m433,NEO,I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
219548,L373370,u6526,m433,TANK,Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
219549,L373369,u6520,m433,CYPHER,Just get me outta here.
219550,L373368,u6526,m433,TANK,I got you.
219551,L373367,u6520,m433,CYPHER,"There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me."
219552,L373366,u6526,m433,TANK,Cypher?
219553,L373365,u6520,m433,CYPHER,I need an exit!  Fast!
219554,L373364,u6526,m433,TANK,Operator.
219555,L373589,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it."
219556,L373588,u6527,m433,TRINITY,You can't use that until Neo is out!
219557,L373585,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Five minutes.  Maybe six.
219558,L373584,u6527,m433,TRINITY,How long?
219559,L373569,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,He's beginning to believe.
219560,L373568,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What is he doing?
219561,L373333,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,We have no choice.
219562,L373332,u6527,m433,TRINITY,They'll be able to track it.
219563,L373331,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Give me your phone.
219564,L373007,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?"
219565,L373006,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him."
219566,L373000,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Shit!  Apoc?
219567,L372999,u6527,m433,TRINITY,I got a fibrillation!
219568,L372807,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Go.
219569,L372806,u6527,m433,TRINITY,All right --
219570,L372805,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
219571,L372804,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Goddamnit!
219572,L372803,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Yes.
219573,L372802,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Are they any agent?
219574,L372801,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
219575,L373544,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path."
219576,L373543,u6523,m433,NEO,"Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --"
219577,L373347,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
219578,L373346,u6523,m433,NEO,No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
219579,L373250,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me."
219580,L373249,u6523,m433,NEO,"Morpheus, I don't know --"
219581,L373248,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world."
219582,L373245,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me."
219583,L373244,u6523,m433,NEO,Did you believe in them too?
219584,L373243,u6523,m433,NEO,Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
219585,L373242,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Yes I do.
219586,L373241,u6523,m433,NEO,And you still believe I'm the One?
219587,L373240,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut."
219588,L373239,u6523,m433,NEO,"Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?"
219589,L373238,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,That's why we're here.
219590,L373237,u6523,m433,NEO,"What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus."
219591,L373236,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,What do you believe in?
219592,L373235,u6523,m433,NEO,"I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?"
219593,L373234,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Why?
219594,L373233,u6523,m433,NEO,"Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea."
219595,L373231,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,That I would find the One.
219596,L373230,u6523,m433,NEO,What did she tell you?
219597,L373229,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Yes.
219598,L373228,u6523,m433,NEO,She helped you?
219599,L373227,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path."
219600,L373226,u6523,m433,NEO,And she's never wrong.
219601,L373225,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is."
219602,L373224,u6523,m433,NEO,How does she know?
219603,L373223,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,She would say she knows enough.
219604,L373222,u6523,m433,NEO,And she knows what?  Everything?
219605,L373221,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Of the Resistance.
219606,L373220,u6523,m433,NEO,The beginning?
219607,L373219,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
219608,L373218,u6523,m433,NEO,"So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?"
219609,L373149,u6523,m433,NEO,What's going on?
219610,L373148,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Set down in there.
219611,L373144,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to."
219612,L373143,u6523,m433,NEO,What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
219613,L373142,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be."
219614,L373141,u6523,m433,NEO,How?
219615,L373140,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
219616,L373137,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Look again.
219617,L373136,u6523,m433,NEO,Yeah.
219618,L373135,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
219619,L373134,u6523,m433,NEO,I think I do.
219620,L373133,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Do you understand, Neo?"
219621,L373130,u6523,m433,NEO,What -- what lesson?
219622,L373129,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
219623,L373122,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,The body cannot live without the mind.
219624,L373121,u6523,m433,NEO,"If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?"
219625,L373120,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Your mind makes it real.
219626,L373119,u6523,m433,NEO,I thought it wasn't real.
219627,L373115,u6523,m433,NEO,Because... I didn't think I would?
219628,L373114,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Do you know why you didn't make it?
219629,L373104,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program."
219630,L373103,u6523,m433,NEO,I know what you're trying to do --
219631,L373096,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?"
219632,L373095,u6523,m433,NEO,You -- you're too fast.
219633,L373094,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,How did I beat you?
219634,L373089,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Show me.
219635,L373088,u6523,m433,NEO,This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
219636,L373066,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Your training.
219637,L373065,u6523,m433,NEO,For what?
219638,L373064,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
219639,L373051,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth."
219640,L373050,u6523,m433,NEO,No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
219641,L373042,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny."
219642,L373041,u6523,m433,NEO,A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
219643,L373040,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I."
219644,L373035,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
219645,L373034,u6523,m433,NEO,This isn't real?
219646,L373033,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Wild, isn't it?"
219647,L373032,u6523,m433,NEO,"Right now, we're inside a computer program?"
219648,L373020,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
219649,L373019,u6523,m433,NEO,When?
219650,L373018,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,More important than what is when?
219651,L373017,u6523,m433,NEO,"Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?"
219652,L373015,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,You've never used them before.
219653,L373014,u6523,m433,NEO,Why do my eyes hurt?
219654,L373013,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
219655,L373012,u6523,m433,NEO,What are you doing?
219656,L373009,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Far from it.
219657,L373008,u6523,m433,NEO,... am I dead?
219658,L372990,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Be what?  Be real?
219659,L372989,u6523,m433,NEO,This can't be...
219660,L372988,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?"
219661,L372985,u6523,m433,NEO,What does that mean?
219662,L372984,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
219663,L372974,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind."
219664,L372973,u6523,m433,NEO,What truth?
219665,L372972,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."
219666,L372971,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Do you want to know what it is?
219667,L372970,u6523,m433,NEO,The Matrix?
219668,L372969,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?"
219669,L372968,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,I know exactly what you mean.
219670,L372967,u6523,m433,NEO,Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
219671,L372966,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Why not?
219672,L372965,u6523,m433,NEO,No.
219673,L372964,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?"
219674,L372963,u6523,m433,NEO,"You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you."
219675,L372962,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?"
219676,L372961,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
219677,L372960,u6523,m433,NEO,You could say that.
219678,L372959,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?"
219679,L372957,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Please.  Come.  Sit.
219680,L372956,u6523,m433,NEO,It's an honor.
219681,L372955,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus."
219682,L372929,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Go the the Adams Street bridge.
219683,L372928,u6523,m433,NEO,... Yes.
219684,L372927,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Do you still want to meet?
219685,L372926,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you."
219686,L372925,u6523,m433,NEO,What do you know?
219687,L372924,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead."
219688,L372923,u6523,m433,NEO,The agents --
219689,L372922,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,This line is tapped so I must be brief.
219690,L372902,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
219691,L372901,u6523,m433,NEO,"No way, no way, this is crazy."
219692,L372900,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
219693,L372899,u6523,m433,NEO,No!  It's too far away.
219694,L372896,u6523,m433,NEO,How do you know all this?
219695,L372895,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
219696,L372890,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Go!  Now!
219697,L372889,u6523,m433,NEO,But what if...?
219698,L372888,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,The cubicle across from you is empty.
219699,L372887,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say."
219700,L372886,u6523,m433,NEO,How?!
219701,L372885,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there."
219702,L372884,u6523,m433,NEO,What the fuck do they want with me?!
219703,L372883,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Yes.
219704,L372882,u6523,m433,NEO,Holy fucking shit!
219705,L372880,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Yes.  Now.
219706,L372879,u6523,m433,NEO,Right now?
219707,L372878,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Stand up and see for yourself.
219708,L372877,u6523,m433,NEO,Who's coming for me?
219709,L372876,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do."
219710,L372875,u6523,m433,NEO,Morpheus...
219711,L372874,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?"
219712,L372873,u6523,m433,NEO,Hello?
219713,L373630,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,He is the One.  He is the One!
219714,L373629,u6526,m433,TANK,How...?!
219715,L373615,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Do it!
219716,L373614,u6526,m433,TANK,I'm going to make the call.
219717,L373587,u6526,m433,TANK,"Yes, sir."
219718,L373586,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,"Tank, charge the E.M.P."
219719,L373549,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,We're on our way --
219720,L373548,u6526,m433,TANK,"Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo."
219721,L373547,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,We need an exit.
219722,L373546,u6526,m433,TANK,"Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!"
219723,L373545,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Tank.
219724,L373338,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,Good.
219725,L373337,u6526,m433,TANK,Now left and that's it in front of you.
219726,L373336,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,I need the main wet-wall.
219727,L373335,u6526,m433,TANK,Got it.
219728,L373087,u6526,m433,TANK,Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
219729,L373086,u6522,m433,MORPHEUS,How is he?
219730,L373299,u6524,m433,ORACLE,"You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you."
219731,L373298,u6523,m433,NEO,What?
219732,L373297,u6524,m433,ORACLE,"Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours."
219733,L373295,u6523,m433,NEO,"What do you mean, without him?"
219734,L373294,u6524,m433,ORACLE,I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
219735,L373293,u6523,m433,NEO,Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
219736,L373292,u6524,m433,ORACLE,What's funny?
219737,L373291,u6524,m433,ORACLE,"Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go."
219738,L373290,u6523,m433,NEO,What?
219739,L373289,u6524,m433,ORACLE,"Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something."
219740,L373288,u6523,m433,NEO,I'm not the One.
219741,L373287,u6524,m433,ORACLE,But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
219742,L373286,u6523,m433,NEO,But what?
219743,L373285,u6524,m433,ORACLE,"Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --"
219744,L373281,u6523,m433,NEO,Honestly?  I don't know.
219745,L373280,u6524,m433,ORACLE,So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
219746,L373278,u6524,m433,ORACLE,Not too bright though.
219747,L373277,u6523,m433,NEO,Who?
219748,L373276,u6524,m433,ORACLE,You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
219749,L373274,u6523,m433,NEO,How did you know...?
219750,L373273,u6524,m433,ORACLE,I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
219751,L373272,u6523,m433,NEO,"Shit, I'm sorry."
219752,L373271,u6524,m433,ORACLE,That vase.
219753,L373270,u6523,m433,NEO,What vase?
219754,L373269,u6524,m433,ORACLE,"I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase."
219755,L373268,u6523,m433,NEO,Yeah.
219756,L373267,u6524,m433,ORACLE,"Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?"
219757,L373266,u6523,m433,NEO,You're the Oracle?
219758,L373265,u6524,m433,ORACLE,I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
219759,L373264,u6523,m433,NEO,Hello?
219760,L373525,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Not yet.
219761,L373524,u6523,m433,NEO,Can you fly that thing.
219762,L373523,u6523,m433,NEO,"I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving."
219763,L373522,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Are you all right?
219764,L373521,u6523,m433,NEO,It wasn't fast enough.
219765,L373520,u6527,m433,TRINITY,You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
219766,L373519,u6523,m433,NEO,Do what?
219767,L373518,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Neo, how did you do that?"
219768,L373490,u6523,m433,NEO,Yeah?
219769,L373489,u6527,m433,TRINITY,No one has ever done anything like this.
219770,L373481,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else."
219771,L373480,u6523,m433,NEO,"No, you're not."
219772,L373479,u6527,m433,TRINITY,I'm coming with you.
219773,L373478,u6523,m433,NEO,What are you doing?
219774,L373477,u6523,m433,NEO,I believe I can bring him back.
219775,L373476,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What?
219776,L373471,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Because...
219777,L373470,u6523,m433,NEO,Why?
219778,L373469,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true."
219779,L373468,u6523,m433,NEO,"I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters."
219780,L373467,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"No, you... have to be."
219781,L373466,u6523,m433,NEO,"I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too."
219782,L373465,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What?
219783,L373464,u6523,m433,NEO,Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
219784,L373463,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
219785,L373462,u6523,m433,NEO,I have to.
219786,L373461,u6527,m433,TRINITY,You can't!
219787,L373460,u6523,m433,NEO,I'm going in after him.
219788,L373459,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What are you doing?
219789,L373458,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What choice?
219790,L373457,u6523,m433,NEO,That I would have to make a choice...
219791,L373446,u6523,m433,NEO,There has to be something that we can do.
219792,L373445,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
219793,L373388,u6523,m433,NEO,I don't know.  It just went dead.
219794,L373387,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What happened?
219795,L373374,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?"
219796,L373373,u6523,m433,NEO,Is Morpheus alive?
219797,L373353,u6527,m433,TRINITY,We have to!
219798,L373352,u6523,m433,NEO,We can't leave him!
219799,L373351,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Go!
219800,L373324,u6527,m433,TRINITY,A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
219801,L373323,u6523,m433,NEO,What is it?
219802,L373322,u6523,m433,NEO,It might have been.  I'm not sure.
219803,L373321,u6527,m433,TRINITY,How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
219804,L373320,u6523,m433,NEO,A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
219805,L373319,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What happened?  What did you see?
219806,L373318,u6523,m433,NEO,Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
219807,L373317,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What did you just say?
219808,L373306,u6523,m433,NEO,... right as rain.
219809,L373305,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Are you all right?
219810,L373214,u6527,m433,TRINITY,She told me...
219811,L373213,u6523,m433,NEO,What did she tell you?
219812,L373212,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Yes.
219813,L373211,u6523,m433,NEO,Did you go to her?
219814,L373210,u6527,m433,TRINITY,No.
219815,L373209,u6523,m433,NEO,Should I be?
219816,L373208,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Are you worried?
219817,L373207,u6523,m433,NEO,Is it?
219818,L373206,u6527,m433,TRINITY,That's different.
219819,L373205,u6523,m433,NEO,But an Oracle can.
219820,L373204,u6527,m433,TRINITY,That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
219821,L373203,u6523,m433,NEO,What does that mean?
219822,L373201,u6523,m433,NEO,I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
219823,L373200,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What?
219824,L373199,u6523,m433,NEO,God...
219825,L373158,u6527,m433,TRINITY,It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
219826,L373157,u6523,m433,NEO,E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
219827,L373054,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Easy, Neo.  Easy."
219828,L373053,u6523,m433,NEO,Get this thing out of me!
219829,L372993,u6527,m433,TRINITY,It's going into replication.
219830,L372992,u6523,m433,NEO,Uh-oh...
219831,L372948,u6527,m433,TRINITY,We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
219832,L372947,u6523,m433,NEO,What is this thing?
219833,L372945,u6523,m433,NEO,... shit.
219834,L372944,u6527,m433,TRINITY,And I know that's not where you want to be.
219835,L372943,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends."
219836,L372942,u6523,m433,NEO,Why?
219837,L372941,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Neo, please, you have to trust me."
219838,L372934,u6527,m433,TRINITY,From you.
219839,L372933,u6523,m433,NEO,From what?
219840,L372932,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection."
219841,L372931,u6523,m433,NEO,What the hell is this?!
219842,L372862,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it."
219843,L372861,u6523,m433,NEO,What is the Matrix?
219844,L372860,u6527,m433,TRINITY,It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
219845,L372858,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him."
219846,L372857,u6523,m433,NEO,Who is?
219847,L372856,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"They're watching you, Neo."
219848,L372855,u6523,m433,NEO,Of what?
219849,L372854,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you."
219850,L372853,u6523,m433,NEO,How did you do that?
219851,L372851,u6527,m433,TRINITY,No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
219852,L372850,u6523,m433,NEO,Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
219853,L372849,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Most guys do.
219854,L372848,u6523,m433,NEO,I just thought... you were a guy.
219855,L372847,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What?
219856,L372846,u6523,m433,NEO,Gee-zus.
219857,L372845,u6527,m433,TRINITY,That was a long time ago.
219858,L372844,u6523,m433,NEO,Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
219859,L372843,u6527,m433,TRINITY,My name is Trinity.
219860,L372842,u6523,m433,NEO,Who are you?
219861,L372841,u6527,m433,TRINITY,I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
219862,L372840,u6523,m433,NEO,How do you know that name?
219863,L372839,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Hello, Neo."
219864,L373606,u6526,m433,TANK,Kick it in!  Kick it in!
219865,L373605,u6523,m433,NEO,It's locked.
219866,L373598,u6526,m433,TANK,Duck!
219867,L373597,u6523,m433,NEO,Which way?  Which way?
219868,L373592,u6523,m433,NEO,"Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!"
219869,L373591,u6526,m433,TANK,Operator.
219870,L373488,u6523,m433,NEO,Guns.  Lots of guns.
219871,L373487,u6526,m433,TANK,Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
219872,L373475,u6523,m433,NEO,Because I believe in something.
219873,L373474,u6526,m433,TANK,Why?
219874,L373473,u6523,m433,NEO,"I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go."
219875,L373472,u6526,m433,TANK,"Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide."
219876,L373456,u6523,m433,NEO,The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
219877,L373455,u6526,m433,TANK,What are you talking about?
219878,L373454,u6523,m433,NEO,Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
219879,L373453,u6526,m433,TANK,"Neo, this has to be done!"
219880,L373452,u6523,m433,NEO,Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
219881,L373439,u6526,m433,TANK,Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
219882,L373438,u6523,m433,NEO,What do they want?
219883,L373437,u6526,m433,TANK,"When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know."
219884,L373436,u6526,m433,TANK,"Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this."
219885,L373435,u6523,m433,NEO,How much time?
219886,L373434,u6526,m433,TANK,They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
219887,L373433,u6523,m433,NEO,How?
219888,L373432,u6526,m433,TANK,They're hacking his mind.
219889,L373431,u6523,m433,NEO,What are they doing to him?
219890,L373196,u6526,m433,TANK,The Oracle.
219891,L373195,u6523,m433,NEO,See who?
219892,L373085,u6523,m433,NEO,Hell yes!
219893,L373084,u6526,m433,TANK,"Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?"
219894,L373083,u6523,m433,NEO,Holy shit!
219895,L373077,u6526,m433,TANK,"Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it."
219896,L373076,u6523,m433,NEO,Where is it?
219897,L373075,u6526,m433,TANK,The last human city.  The only place we got left.
219898,L373074,u6523,m433,NEO,It's a city?
219899,L373073,u6526,m433,TANK,"If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be."
219900,L373072,u6523,m433,NEO,Zion?
219901,L373071,u6526,m433,TANK,"Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion."
219902,L373070,u6523,m433,NEO,You don't have...
219903,L373069,u6526,m433,TANK,You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
219904,L373068,u6523,m433,NEO,No.
219905,L373067,u6526,m433,TANK,Morning.  Did you sleep?
219906,L373620,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Hurry, Neo."
219907,L373619,u6526,m433,TANK,They've burned through the outer shields.
219908,L373580,u6526,m433,TANK,I don't know.  I lost him.
219909,L373579,u6527,m433,TRINITY,What just happened?
219910,L373565,u6526,m433,TANK,I can't!
219911,L373564,u6527,m433,TRINITY,An Agent!  You have to send me back!
219912,L373563,u6526,m433,TANK,What the hell just happened?
219913,L373562,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Neo!
219914,L373527,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter."
219915,L373526,u6526,m433,TANK,Operator.
219916,L373449,u6526,m433,TANK,"Trinity, we don't have any other choice."
219917,L373448,u6527,m433,TRINITY,You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
219918,L373447,u6526,m433,TANK,There is.  We have to pull the plug.
219919,L373419,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Dozer?
219920,L373418,u6526,m433,TANK,I'll be all right.
219921,L373417,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Tank, you're hurt."
219922,L373381,u6527,m433,TRINITY,Got it.
219923,L373380,u6526,m433,TANK,So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
219924,L373379,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Cypher, I thought --"
219925,L373378,u6526,m433,TANK,You're not far from Cypher.
219926,L373377,u6527,m433,TRINITY,We need an exit!
219927,L373376,u6527,m433,TRINITY,He's alive.
219928,L373375,u6526,m433,TANK,Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
219929,L373372,u6527,m433,TRINITY,"Tank, it's me."
219930,L373371,u6526,m433,TANK,Operator.
219931,L374319,u6528,m434,BOY,Let go of her.
219932,L374318,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
219933,L374316,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Nothing's private...
219934,L374315,u6528,m434,BOY,Look fella...this is private...
219935,L374314,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?"
219936,L374210,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch."
219937,L374209,u6528,m434,BOY,Sounds good.
219938,L374208,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out..."
219939,L374207,u6528,m434,BOY,"Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and..."
219940,L374206,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,What are your plans?
219941,L374205,u6528,m434,BOY,Thanks.
219942,L374204,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"No, really, I liked it...thought it was great."
219943,L373956,u6528,m434,BOY,Follow me.
219944,L373955,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Know where he is?
219945,L373954,u6528,m434,BOY,Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
219946,L373953,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
219947,L374020,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?"
219948,L374019,u6529,m434,BOY #1,Riverdale.
219949,L374007,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,You sure?
219950,L374006,u6529,m434,BOY #1,"No, all we got is $40."
219951,L374002,u6529,m434,BOY #1,You got sparklers?
219952,L374001,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,That means it's good.
219953,L374000,u6529,m434,BOY #1,No.
219954,L373997,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?"
219955,L373996,u6529,m434,BOY #1,"Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth..."
219956,L373993,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit."
219957,L373992,u6529,m434,BOY #1,We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
219958,L374005,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
219959,L374004,u6530,m434,BOY #2,And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
219960,L374003,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Yeah.

220073,L374098,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!"

220077,L374094,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,"If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can."
220078,L374093,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,How?
220079,L374092,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,"Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess."
220080,L374091,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?"
220081,L374090,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
220082,L374089,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?"
220083,L374088,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
220084,L374087,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,That's not going to help.

220089,L374080,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
220090,L374077,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
220091,L374076,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,Don't come any closer!!!

220100,L373820,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?"
220101,L373819,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
220102,L373818,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
220103,L373817,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,I don't like loading crates.

220112,L373808,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
220113,L373805,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"No, she isn't."
220114,L373804,u6537,m434,JOHNNY BOY,I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?

220128,L373888,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
220129,L373887,u6540,m434,OSCAR,"I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?"
220130,L373886,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"I don't understand, where's Groppi?"
220131,L373885,u6540,m434,OSCAR,"Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this."
220132,L373884,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that."
220133,L373883,u6540,m434,OSCAR,"Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old."
220134,L373882,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me."
220135,L373881,u6540,m434,OSCAR,I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
220136,L373880,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"That bad, huh?"
220137,L373879,u6540,m434,OSCAR,"Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing."
220138,L373878,u6540,m434,OSCAR,What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
220139,L373877,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,What pipes?
220140,L373876,u6540,m434,OSCAR,I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
220141,L373875,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,No.
220142,L373874,u6540,m434,OSCAR,Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
220143,L373873,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Ok, how's everything going?"
220144,L373872,u6540,m434,OSCAR,Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
220145,L374332,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"You're not going to use that gun, Johnny."
220146,L374331,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,You're really crazy.
220147,L374327,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Yeah, where's the rest?"
220148,L374326,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Where's the rest?
220149,L374240,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Whatever.
220150,L374239,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?"
220151,L374234,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,We'll be here.
220152,L374233,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
220153,L374068,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,You said it.
220154,L374067,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'"
220155,L374066,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money..."
220156,L374065,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!"
220157,L374064,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it."
220158,L374063,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'"
220159,L374062,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"Charlie, this is business."
220160,L374061,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?"
220161,L374060,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000."
220162,L374059,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,How much was the original loan again?
220163,L374058,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
220164,L374057,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"He'll be here.  Look, take this for now."
220165,L374056,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice."
220166,L374032,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Let's go to the movies...on you.
220167,L374031,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,$20.
220168,L374030,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,How much?
220169,L374029,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
220170,L374028,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,What's a'matter?
220171,L373982,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,We'll settle it tonight.
220172,L373981,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing."
220173,L373980,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
220174,L373979,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
220175,L373978,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Oh Michael, look..."
220176,L373801,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Yeah, thanks, it's ok."
220177,L373800,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,You getting out too?
220178,L373799,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,C'mon Johnny.
220179,L373798,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Out!!!!
220180,L373797,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Ok...that's it.
220181,L373796,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Disgraceful.
220182,L373792,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Get him in.
220183,L373791,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"Hey, shut up."
220184,L373769,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"OK, get in."
220185,L373768,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Michael, give us a lift."
220186,L373695,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,OK.
220187,L373694,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?"
220188,L373693,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
220189,L373692,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that."
220190,L373691,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?"
220191,L373690,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that."
220192,L373689,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that."
220193,L373688,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,"I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me..."
220194,L373687,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?"
220195,L373686,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
220196,L373685,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Nope...
220197,L373684,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
220198,L373683,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,No...I'll be ok for a week.
220199,L373682,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
220200,L373681,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"OK, ok..."
220201,L373680,u6539,m434,MICHAEL,For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
220202,L373679,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Oh great...hey - Winstons?
220203,L374232,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Bye.
220204,L374231,u6533,m434,DIANE,Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
220205,L374230,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
220206,L374229,u6533,m434,DIANE,Chinese food?
220207,L374228,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight."
220208,L374227,u6533,m434,DIANE,Hostess?
220209,L374226,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,No...no stripping...as the hostess.
220210,L374225,u6533,m434,DIANE,Stripper?
220211,L374224,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
220212,L374223,u6533,m434,DIANE,That's nice.
220213,L374222,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
220214,L374221,u6533,m434,DIANE,I know.
220215,L374220,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"No, I'm serious...You're really good."
220216,L374219,u6533,m434,DIANE,Fine.
220217,L374218,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
220218,L374217,u6533,m434,DIANE,Fine.
220219,L374216,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Diane, how are you feeling?"
220220,L374152,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Oh yeah, that's a possibility."
220221,L374151,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"Well, maybe you missed something?"
220222,L374148,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,All right.
220223,L374147,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm ""cumpari"" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved."
220224,L374146,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,What do they expect you to say?
220225,L374145,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
220226,L374144,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head."
220227,L374143,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"No, she's got epilepsy."
220228,L374142,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"...The one who's sick, right?  In the head."
220229,L374141,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Teresa.
220230,L374140,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you..."
220231,L374135,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,What did he do?
220232,L374134,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks..."
220233,L374129,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
220234,L374128,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Oh yes, he's pretty good."
220235,L374116,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it."
220236,L374115,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure."
220237,L374114,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?"
220238,L374113,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?"
220239,L373968,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night..."
220240,L373967,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is..."
220241,L373966,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?"
220242,L373965,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Oh...around...why?
220243,L373964,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"Hey, where you been?"
220244,L373963,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Ok.
220245,L373962,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,Take a drink!
220246,L373913,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
220247,L373912,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
220248,L373911,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,"Yes, you did."
220249,L373910,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
220250,L373909,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,No you weren't.
220251,L373908,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,About that shooting last night...I was there and...
220252,L373907,u6534,m434,GIOVANNI,Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
220253,L373906,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Uncle, how are you feeling?"
220254,L374150,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times."
220255,L374149,u6538,m434,MARIO,Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
220256,L374131,u6538,m434,MARIO,"Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now."
220257,L374130,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
220258,L374124,u6538,m434,MARIO,Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
220259,L374123,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"""Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."""
220260,L374122,u6538,m434,MARIO,Wha?
220261,L374121,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"""Francis Macomber."""
220262,L374120,u6538,m434,MARIO,"No, c'mon...Y'know, I read."
220263,L374119,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Nothing.
220264,L374118,u6538,m434,MARIO,What was it?
220265,L374117,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Wasn't a book...was a short story.
220266,L374242,u6542,m434,TERESA,"For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?"
220267,L374241,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
220268,L374214,u6542,m434,TERESA,But...
220269,L374213,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye."
220270,L374212,u6542,m434,TERESA,Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
220271,L374211,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all..."
220272,L374073,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
220273,L374072,u6542,m434,TERESA,The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
220274,L373947,u6542,m434,TERESA,The green capsules in the top drawer.
220275,L373946,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
220276,L373945,u6542,m434,TERESA,I'm sleepy.
220277,L373944,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
220278,L373943,u6542,m434,TERESA,Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
220279,L373942,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?"
220280,L373938,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,I know...I know.
220281,L373937,u6542,m434,TERESA,I can take care of myself.  You know that.
220282,L373936,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Well you can't blame them in a way.
220283,L373935,u6542,m434,TERESA,You know why...with my parents.
220284,L373934,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
220285,L373933,u6542,m434,TERESA,I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
220286,L373931,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Watch your language.
220287,L373930,u6542,m434,TERESA,You're intolerable today.
220288,L373929,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,That W.A.S.P. bastard.
220289,L373928,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
220290,L373927,u6542,m434,TERESA,Sure...He lives there?
220291,L373926,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
220292,L373924,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,That's the word...preoccupied.
220293,L373923,u6542,m434,TERESA,I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
220294,L373922,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Take your time.  I don't care.
220295,L373921,u6542,m434,TERESA,It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
220296,L373920,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
220297,L373919,u6542,m434,TERESA,A paper on that one too?
220298,L373918,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Bore.
220299,L373917,u6542,m434,TERESA,Ok.
220300,L373916,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right."
220301,L373915,u6542,m434,TERESA,C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
220302,L373862,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food."
220303,L373861,u6542,m434,TERESA,It's still sick.
220304,L373860,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
220305,L373859,u6542,m434,TERESA,It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
220306,L373858,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though."
220307,L373857,u6542,m434,TERESA,No.
220308,L373856,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Did you?

220311,L373853,u6542,m434,TERESA,What is it now?
220312,L373852,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"You know...like restaurants, night clubs..."
220313,L373851,u6542,m434,TERESA,Anything specific?
220314,L373850,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
220315,L373849,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Nobody knows anything, believe me."
220316,L373848,u6542,m434,TERESA,Charlie...?
220317,L373847,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Maybe, who knows."
220318,L373846,u6542,m434,TERESA,An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
220319,L373845,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing."
220320,L373844,u6542,m434,TERESA,It's all right.
220321,L373843,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Sure...it's not that...I mean...
220322,L373842,u6542,m434,TERESA,I don't mind.
220323,L373841,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Well...
220324,L373840,u6542,m434,TERESA,Please take it.
220325,L373839,u6542,m434,TERESA,Here.
220326,L373838,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
220327,L373837,u6542,m434,TERESA,Do you have enough?
220328,L373836,u6532,m434,CHARLIE,"Ok, we'll go for lunch."
220329,L373835,u6542,m434,TERESA,I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
220330,L374196,u6536,m434,JOEY,"Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends."

220380,L376234,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Yeah, speak for yourself."
220381,L376233,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Look who's talking.
220382,L376182,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You think so?
220383,L376181,u6544,m435,ALLISON,-- But he does seem very nice.
220384,L376179,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds..."
220385,L376178,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
220386,L376177,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?"
220387,L375870,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --"

220391,L375860,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --"
220392,L375522,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away."
220393,L375521,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"I'm Allison, you're 'honey'."
220394,L376271,u6548,m435,DREW,"Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along."

220403,L375740,u6548,m435,DREW,Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
220404,L375739,u6544,m435,ALLISON,His wife?
220405,L375738,u6548,m435,DREW,He's coming.
220406,L375737,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Did you speak to the Governor?
220407,L376615,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Yes, it is."
220408,L376614,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party."
220409,L376612,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, ""What does she want now?"""
220410,L376611,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I wasn't going to say --
220411,L376610,u6544,m435,ALLISON,That you've been to Susan?
220412,L376609,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I haven't been the father to you that --
220413,L376608,u6544,m435,ALLISON,They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
220414,L376607,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
220415,L376606,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you."
220416,L376604,u6544,m435,ALLISON,-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
220417,L376603,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Do they, m'dear?"
220418,L376602,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'."
220419,L376601,u6552,m435,PARRISH,It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
220420,L376600,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Hi, Daddy, what do you think?"
220421,L376355,u6544,m435,ALLISON,'Goddam party'!
220422,L376354,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Oh, the goddam party --"
220423,L376353,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"It's for the party, Dad --"
220424,L376352,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't like cake.
220425,L376351,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in."
220426,L376350,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Who's Annie?
220427,L376349,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Annie made them.
220428,L376348,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What is this?
220429,L376200,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"That's okay, Daddy."
220430,L376199,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
220431,L376198,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not."
220432,L376197,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Of course.
220433,L376196,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --"
220434,L376195,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict."
220435,L376194,u6544,m435,ALLISON,From the Korean War.
220436,L376193,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Who?
220437,L376192,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
220438,L375882,u6552,m435,PARRISH,We've got some things to discuss.
220439,L375881,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---"
220440,L375836,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black."
220441,L375835,u6552,m435,PARRISH,-- Black.
220442,L375819,u6552,m435,PARRISH,A name?
220443,L375818,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
220444,L375730,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
220445,L375729,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it."
220446,L375728,u6544,m435,ALLISON,And you could care less --
220447,L375727,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I know you do, darling."
220448,L375726,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --"
220449,L375725,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"What, honey?"
220450,L375529,u6544,m435,ALLISON,No.
220451,L375528,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
220452,L375527,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it."
220453,L375526,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I hate parties --
220454,L375518,u6544,m435,ALLISON,But it's your birthday.
220455,L375517,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing."
220456,L375516,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept..."
220457,L375515,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
220458,L375514,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Have you got a minute?
220459,L375513,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Hi, Allison --"
220460,L375512,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Daddy!
220461,L376364,u6544,m435,ALLISON,What will I tell Annie?
220462,L376363,u6553,m435,QUINCE,But what?
220463,L376362,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Yeah, but --"
220464,L375845,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"You know what I'm saying, Joe?"
220465,L375844,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Honey --!
220466,L375843,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen."
220467,L375842,u6544,m435,ALLISON,Paillarde of veal.
220468,L375749,u6553,m435,QUINCE,No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
220469,L375748,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'."
220470,L375746,u6553,m435,QUINCE,He said he would be there with bells on.
220471,L375745,u6544,m435,ALLISON,What about the Mayor?
220472,L375567,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --"
220473,L375566,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!"
220474,L375565,u6544,m435,ALLISON,"Honey, please."
220475,L376620,u6553,m435,QUINCE,Both.
220476,L376619,u6545,m435,AMBROSE,Red or white?
220477,L376618,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Okay, give me a bottle of wine."
220478,L376617,u6545,m435,AMBROSE,"I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince."
220479,L375545,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit."
220480,L375544,u6545,m435,AMBROSE,"Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning."
220481,L375543,u6553,m435,QUINCE,What do you do that for?
220482,L375542,u6545,m435,AMBROSE,Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
220483,L375541,u6553,m435,QUINCE,And that?
220484,L375540,u6545,m435,AMBROSE,"-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert."
220485,L375539,u6553,m435,QUINCE,...This shit's not bad.
220486,L375640,u6546,m435,BONTECOU,"Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint."
220487,L375639,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I thought you were buying my company.
220488,L375638,u6546,m435,BONTECOU,"Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --"
220489,L375637,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I'm sorry, I don't recall --"
220490,L375636,u6546,m435,BONTECOU,"We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?"
220491,L375635,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Good, good.  Glad to hear it."
220492,L375634,u6546,m435,BONTECOU,"Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table."
220493,L376251,u6547,m435,COYLE,Right away.
220494,L376250,u6551,m435,JOE,Toast?  No...just the butter.
220495,L376249,u6547,m435,COYLE,"How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?"
220496,L376248,u6551,m435,JOE,I would prefer some peanut butter.
220497,L375934,u6547,m435,COYLE,"I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?"
220498,L375933,u6551,m435,JOE,'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
220499,L375932,u6547,m435,COYLE,"You mean this, sir?"
220500,L375931,u6551,m435,JOE,What are you eating.
220501,L375930,u6547,m435,COYLE,"Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure."
220502,L375929,u6551,m435,JOE,Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
220503,L375928,u6547,m435,COYLE,"Yes, sir?"
220504,L376397,u6548,m435,DREW,So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
220505,L376396,u6555,m435,SUSAN,That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
220506,L376395,u6548,m435,DREW,"Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him."
220507,L376299,u6548,m435,DREW,Yeah.  Goodnight.
220508,L376298,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Well... goodnight.
220509,L376297,u6548,m435,DREW,"No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know."
220510,L376296,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?"
220511,L376295,u6548,m435,DREW,That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
220512,L376294,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Drew, you're out of line."
220513,L376293,u6548,m435,DREW,"Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you."
220514,L376292,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
220515,L376291,u6548,m435,DREW,Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
220516,L376290,u6555,m435,SUSAN,...See you tomorrow night.
220517,L375884,u6555,m435,SUSAN,What 'business'?
220518,L375883,u6548,m435,DREW,-- Did I hear 'business'?
220519,L375548,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Hi.
220520,L375547,u6548,m435,DREW,"Hello, Beautiful."
220521,L376446,u6554,m435,SLOANE,He'll wait --
220522,L376445,u6548,m435,DREW,Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
220523,L376444,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --"
220524,L376337,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"Hello, Quince."
220525,L376336,u6548,m435,DREW,Thank you for coming.
220526,L376334,u6548,m435,DREW,Am I not obligated to?
220527,L376333,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"You're taking this too far, Drew."
220528,L376332,u6548,m435,DREW,"Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five."
220529,L376331,u6554,m435,SLOANE,And what would that be?
220530,L376770,u6548,m435,DREW,The dagger --?
220531,L376769,u6551,m435,JOE,"I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --"
220532,L376768,u6548,m435,DREW,I'm not stepping anywhere --
220533,L376764,u6551,m435,JOE,-- And now you're going to pee some more.
220534,L376763,u6548,m435,DREW,"So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants."
220535,L376392,u6548,m435,DREW,"Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing."
220536,L376391,u6551,m435,JOE,"No, I don't --"
220537,L376273,u6548,m435,DREW,I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
220538,L376272,u6551,m435,JOE,Perhaps you could remind me.
220539,L376268,u6551,m435,JOE,Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
220540,L376267,u6548,m435,DREW,Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
220541,L376266,u6551,m435,JOE,But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
220542,L376265,u6548,m435,DREW,Who are we talking about?
220543,L376231,u6548,m435,DREW,"Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat."
220544,L376230,u6551,m435,JOE,No.
220545,L376155,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes.
220546,L376154,u6548,m435,DREW,May I interrupting?
220547,L376054,u6551,m435,JOE,Then why did you bring it up?
220548,L376053,u6548,m435,DREW,It doesn't matter.
220549,L376052,u6551,m435,JOE,Of whom?
220550,L376051,u6548,m435,DREW,"It's just a saying, Mr. Black,"
220551,L376050,u6551,m435,JOE,What an odd pairing.
220552,L376049,u6548,m435,DREW,Yes.
220553,L376048,u6551,m435,JOE,"""Death and Taxes""?"
220554,L376047,u6548,m435,DREW,Yes.
220555,L376038,u6548,m435,DREW,And a glass.
220556,L376037,u6551,m435,JOE,Cold.
220557,L376036,u6548,m435,DREW,Hot or cold.
220558,L376035,u6551,m435,JOE,"Why yes, thank you."
220559,L376034,u6548,m435,DREW,"Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?"
220560,L376033,u6551,m435,JOE,Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
220561,L376032,u6548,m435,DREW,The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
220562,L376031,u6551,m435,JOE,Thank you.
220563,L376030,u6548,m435,DREW,"Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing."
220564,L375873,u6548,m435,DREW,'Here'?
220565,L375872,u6551,m435,JOE,Here...
220566,L375871,u6548,m435,DREW,"Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?"
220567,L375858,u6548,m435,DREW,"Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?"
220568,L375857,u6551,m435,JOE,I didn't say.
220569,L375856,u6548,m435,DREW,What side of the industry did you say you were on?
220570,L375855,u6551,m435,JOE,We have an arrangement now.
220571,L376788,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
220572,L376787,u6548,m435,DREW,You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
220573,L376786,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You get not to go to jail.
220574,L376785,u6548,m435,DREW,And what do I get?
220575,L376784,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal."
220576,L376783,u6548,m435,DREW,I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
220577,L376761,u6548,m435,DREW,"Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since."
220578,L376760,u6552,m435,PARRISH,The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
220579,L376759,u6548,m435,DREW,I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
220580,L376452,u6548,m435,DREW,Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
220581,L376451,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"In English, please."
220582,L376450,u6548,m435,DREW,But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
220583,L376449,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
220584,L376443,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Are you running this Board or am I?
220585,L376442,u6548,m435,DREW,"Certainly, Bill."
220586,L376441,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?"
220587,L376440,u6548,m435,DREW,So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
220588,L376439,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you."
220589,L376438,u6548,m435,DREW,Don't you want to hear the details?
220590,L376437,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"The answer is no, quick enough for you?"
220591,L376436,u6548,m435,DREW,Bontecou wants a quick response and --
220592,L376435,u6552,m435,PARRISH,That's it?
220593,L376433,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't think so.  Do you?
220594,L376432,u6548,m435,DREW,"Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?"
220595,L376388,u6548,m435,DREW,Certainly.  Goodnight.
220596,L376387,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I think it's time you went home, Drew."
220597,L376386,u6548,m435,DREW,I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
220598,L376385,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
220599,L376384,u6548,m435,DREW,Yours.
220600,L376383,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Whose?
220601,L376382,u6548,m435,DREW,"With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor."
220602,L376381,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't care.
220603,L376380,u6548,m435,DREW,What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
220604,L376379,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Over my dead body.
220605,L376378,u6548,m435,DREW,"If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer."
220606,L376377,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What are their feelings?
220607,L376376,u6548,m435,DREW,"Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs."
220608,L376375,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now."
220609,L376279,u6548,m435,DREW,Sure.
220610,L376278,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Okay, we'll see you tomorrow."
220611,L376277,u6548,m435,DREW,"I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out."
220612,L376259,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Please, Drew."
220613,L376258,u6548,m435,DREW,Mind if I throw up?
220614,L376226,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him."
220615,L376225,u6548,m435,DREW,For how long?  And why?
220616,L376224,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around."
220617,L376223,u6548,m435,DREW,As much as Joe's?
220618,L376222,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice."
220619,L376167,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it."
220620,L376166,u6548,m435,DREW,I thought this was practically a done deal --
220621,L376165,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew."
220622,L376163,u6548,m435,DREW,"I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --"
220623,L376162,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Why?
220624,L376161,u6548,m435,DREW,How nice for you both.
220625,L376160,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
220626,L376159,u6548,m435,DREW,"Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill."
220627,L376158,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Sit down, Drew."
220628,L376157,u6548,m435,DREW,'Just kidding'?
220629,L376156,u6552,m435,PARRISH,No.
220630,L376059,u6548,m435,DREW,"But the matter's still on the table, Bill --"
220631,L376058,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Shall we adjourn?
220632,L376057,u6548,m435,DREW,Glad I could be of some help.
220633,L376056,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I am now.
220634,L376055,u6548,m435,DREW,"You're not familiar with the phrase, ""In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes""?"
220635,L376045,u6548,m435,DREW,"That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes."
220636,L376044,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
220637,L376043,u6548,m435,DREW,...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
220638,L375854,u6548,m435,DREW,I get the feeling you've done some business before.
220639,L375853,u6552,m435,PARRISH,No --
220640,L375849,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Uh -- he's from out of town --
220641,L375848,u6548,m435,DREW,Have we met?
220642,L375834,u6548,m435,DREW,Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
220643,L375833,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What do you mean?
220644,L375832,u6548,m435,DREW,Is there any more to it?
220645,L375831,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yes.
220646,L375830,u6548,m435,DREW,'Joe...'
220647,L375825,u6548,m435,DREW,What?!
220648,L375824,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
220649,L375821,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --"
220650,L375820,u6548,m435,DREW,"Yeah, something he goes by --"
220651,L375679,u6548,m435,DREW,Olympic.
220652,L375678,u6552,m435,PARRISH,As close as a deal could be.
220653,L375677,u6548,m435,DREW,"So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?"

220655,L375673,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Like a marriage made in heaven?
220656,L375672,u6548,m435,DREW,"I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --"
220657,L375671,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Me, too."
220658,L375670,u6548,m435,DREW,I'm all excited --
220659,L375633,u6548,m435,DREW,That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
220660,L375632,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time."
220661,L375630,u6548,m435,DREW,"Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one."
220662,L375629,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Do you think I need a haircut?

220681,L376751,u6548,m435,DREW,He said that?
220682,L376750,u6553,m435,QUINCE,He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
220683,L376749,u6548,m435,DREW,"This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart."
220684,L376469,u6548,m435,DREW,Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
220685,L376468,u6553,m435,QUINCE,I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
220686,L376467,u6548,m435,DREW,"The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park."
220687,L376466,u6553,m435,QUINCE,But I didn't mean to do it!
220688,L376465,u6548,m435,DREW,"Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs."

220690,L376463,u6548,m435,DREW,"That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace."
220691,L376462,u6553,m435,QUINCE,What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
220692,L376347,u6553,m435,QUINCE,That's what he said.
220693,L376346,u6548,m435,DREW,'It's up to Joe'?
220694,L376345,u6553,m435,QUINCE,The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
220695,L376344,u6548,m435,DREW,-- But he was concerned about the timing?
220696,L376343,u6553,m435,QUINCE,He was interested.
220697,L376342,u6548,m435,DREW,How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
220698,L376341,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger."
220699,L376275,u6548,m435,DREW,"You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?"
220700,L376274,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff."
220701,L376212,u6548,m435,DREW,Yeah.  Neat.

220704,L376209,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Yeah, that's what he said."
220705,L376208,u6548,m435,DREW,"'It's up to Joe', huh?"
220706,L376207,u6553,m435,QUINCE,Yeah.
220707,L376206,u6548,m435,DREW,'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
220708,L376205,u6553,m435,QUINCE,We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
220709,L376204,u6548,m435,DREW,Are you?
220710,L376203,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man."
220711,L376202,u6548,m435,DREW,"Thanks, Quince."
220712,L376201,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up."
220713,L375868,u6548,m435,DREW,"Joe, you do get around."
220714,L375867,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Well, I guess he's found one."
220715,L375755,u6553,m435,QUINCE,I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
220716,L375754,u6548,m435,DREW,You're overthinking it --
220717,L375609,u6553,m435,QUINCE,I know.  Gum up the works.
220718,L375608,u6548,m435,DREW,"Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --"

220774,L376640,u6553,m435,QUINCE,You think so?  How do you know?
220775,L376638,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?"
220776,L376637,u6551,m435,JOE,"Oh yes, you are one of my favorites."
220777,L376636,u6553,m435,QUINCE,Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.

220779,L376634,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free."
220780,L376633,u6551,m435,JOE,"'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?"
220781,L376632,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter."
220782,L376631,u6551,m435,JOE,But she loves you?
220783,L376630,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in."
220784,L376629,u6551,m435,JOE,How did you meet?
220785,L376628,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Oh yes, I do."

220790,L376623,u6551,m435,JOE,Do I?  I'm a little confused.
220791,L376622,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me."
220792,L376373,u6551,m435,JOE,You're welcome.
220793,L376372,u6553,m435,QUINCE,Thanks.
220794,L376371,u6551,m435,JOE,"And you're a nice man, Quince."
220795,L376370,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe..."
220796,L376369,u6551,m435,JOE,"On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one."
220797,L376368,u6553,m435,QUINCE,I didn't know that.

220802,L375885,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Don't bother asking, we already tried."
220803,L375879,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Hey, this is fun."
220804,L375878,u6551,m435,JOE,Black.
220805,L375851,u6551,m435,JOE,As long as it takes.
220806,L375850,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"How long you here, Joe?"

220821,L376732,u6555,m435,SUSAN,But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --

220830,L376667,u6551,m435,JOE,"I believe that, don't you?"
220831,L376666,u6555,m435,SUSAN,It's a saying.
220832,L376665,u6551,m435,JOE,'Love will find out the way'?

220835,L376662,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --"
220836,L376661,u6551,m435,JOE,Will it?
220837,L376660,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Don't.  That will come later.
220838,L376659,u6551,m435,JOE,But there's so much to tell you --
220839,L376658,u6555,m435,SUSAN,We know all that we need to know --
220840,L376657,u6551,m435,JOE,We know so little about each other --
220841,L376656,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Then don't.
220842,L376655,u6551,m435,JOE,No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
220843,L376654,u6555,m435,SUSAN,It gets worse.
220844,L376653,u6551,m435,JOE,I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
220845,L376652,u6555,m435,SUSAN,And you can't tell me who you are.
220846,L376651,u6551,m435,JOE,Well -- I --
220847,L376650,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Where are you going?
220848,L376649,u6551,m435,JOE,"Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end."
220849,L376648,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"It beats a surgical, doesn't it?"
220850,L376647,u6551,m435,JOE,I love you in an evening gown.
220851,L376646,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I like you in a black tie.
220852,L376499,u6551,m435,JOE,"Oh, I hope a long, long time."
220853,L376498,u6555,m435,SUSAN,For how long?
220854,L376497,u6551,m435,JOE,Nowhere?  I'm...here.
220855,L376496,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Where are you going?
220856,L376495,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes!
220857,L376494,u6555,m435,SUSAN,More than you love peanut butter?
220858,L376493,u6551,m435,JOE,I loved it.
220859,L376492,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Did you like making love to me?
220860,L376489,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Maybe it's the draft through the door.
220861,L376488,u6551,m435,JOE,...No.
220862,L376486,u6551,m435,JOE,"Yes, he's tired.  I believe so."
220863,L376485,u6555,m435,SUSAN,He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
220864,L376484,u6551,m435,JOE,He's taking a nap.
220865,L376482,u6551,m435,JOE,How beautiful.
220866,L376481,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --"
220867,L376480,u6551,m435,JOE,I am.
220868,L376479,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You're here?
220869,L376418,u6551,m435,JOE,Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
220870,L376417,u6555,m435,SUSAN,And is your heart beating strangely?
220871,L376416,u6551,m435,JOE,"Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --"
220872,L376415,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I don't know who you are.
220873,L376414,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes?
220874,L376410,u6551,m435,JOE,"Why, yes.  Thank you."
220875,L376409,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?"
220876,L376408,u6551,m435,JOE,-- Could you?
220877,L376407,u6555,m435,SUSAN,It was everything.
220878,L376406,u6551,m435,JOE,Thank you.
220879,L376405,u6555,m435,SUSAN,-- I guess you haven't.
220880,L376404,u6551,m435,JOE,I love your smell.
220881,L376402,u6551,m435,JOE,Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
220882,L376401,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I'm sorry about --
220883,L376399,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I said get out.
220884,L376398,u6551,m435,JOE,Almost.
220885,L376394,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Why don't you get off his case?
220886,L376393,u6551,m435,JOE,You first.
220887,L376315,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes.  I'm tired.
220888,L376314,u6555,m435,SUSAN,'To bed'?
220889,L376313,u6551,m435,JOE,To bed.
220890,L376312,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Where are you going?
220891,L376309,u6551,m435,JOE,No.
220892,L376308,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Gay?
220893,L376307,u6551,m435,JOE,No.
220894,L376306,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Girlfriend?
220895,L376305,u6551,m435,JOE,"No, I'm not."
220896,L376304,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
220897,L376303,u6551,m435,JOE,Why?
220898,L376301,u6551,m435,JOE,I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
220899,L376300,u6555,m435,SUSAN,How long have you been standing there?
220900,L376264,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm sorry to hear that.
220901,L376263,u6555,m435,SUSAN,We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
220902,L376262,u6551,m435,JOE,Has her pain abated?
220903,L376261,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"I am, too."
220904,L376260,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
220905,L376257,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes...I've found that it does.
220906,L376256,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"It comforts you, doesn't it?"
220907,L376255,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes...
220908,L376254,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
220909,L376253,u6551,m435,JOE,I don't know.
220910,L376252,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Why do you love peanut butter so much?
220911,L376220,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"And I appreciate you, too."
220912,L376219,u6551,m435,JOE,I mean I appreciate that.
220913,L376218,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Excuse me?
220914,L376217,u6551,m435,JOE,I appreciate you --
220915,L376216,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome."
220916,L376215,u6551,m435,JOE,"Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon."
220917,L376214,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
220918,L376213,u6551,m435,JOE,"I wanted to apologize, Susan --"
220919,L376137,u6551,m435,JOE,Be sorry for nothing.
220920,L376136,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"I have to go, I'm sorry to say --"
220921,L376135,u6551,m435,JOE,Not now.
220922,L376134,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Joe, I'm with Drew."
220923,L376128,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Yes.
220924,L376127,u6551,m435,JOE,She's in a great deal of pain.
220925,L376093,u6551,m435,JOE,I don't mind --
220926,L376092,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Patients have visitors, not doctors."
220927,L376091,u6551,m435,JOE,And I'll be a visitor.
220928,L376090,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --"
220929,L376089,u6551,m435,JOE,Whatever you do.
220930,L376088,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Watch me do what?
220931,L376087,u6551,m435,JOE,"Very well, I'll watch."
220932,L376086,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
220933,L376085,u6551,m435,JOE,I came to see you.
220934,L376084,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Then why are you here, Joe?"
220935,L376083,u6551,m435,JOE,"Oh goodness, no."
220936,L376081,u6551,m435,JOE,How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
220937,L376080,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Joe --
220938,L375972,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
220939,L375971,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes?
220940,L375969,u6551,m435,JOE,"Goodnight to you, Susan."
220941,L375968,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Goodnight, Joe."
220942,L375967,u6551,m435,JOE,Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
220943,L375966,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Yes?
220944,L375965,u6551,m435,JOE,Susan?
220945,L375964,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
220946,L375963,u6551,m435,JOE,"I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else."
220947,L375962,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Yes --?
220948,L375960,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I can see why.
220949,L375959,u6551,m435,JOE,I don't have any.
220950,L375958,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I've got plenty of friends.
220951,L375957,u6551,m435,JOE,I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
220952,L375956,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home."
220953,L375955,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
220954,L375954,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
220955,L375953,u6551,m435,JOE,"When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing."
220956,L375952,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Come again?
220957,L375951,u6551,m435,JOE,Do you love Drew?
220958,L375950,u6555,m435,SUSAN,-- What kind of childhood did you have?
220959,L375949,u6551,m435,JOE,I haven't.
220960,L375948,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You act like you never had peanut butter before --
220961,L375947,u6551,m435,JOE,Peanut butter.
220962,L375946,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?"
220963,L375945,u6551,m435,JOE,That is not my intention.
220964,L375944,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger."
220965,L375943,u6551,m435,JOE,I am Joe.
220966,L375942,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe."
220967,L375941,u6551,m435,JOE,'Big'?
220968,L375939,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm sorry.
220969,L375938,u6555,m435,SUSAN,-- Can't seem to escape you today.
220970,L375937,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm lost.
220971,L375936,u6555,m435,SUSAN,What are you doing here?
220972,L376834,u6552,m435,PARRISH,That's life.  What can I tell you?
220973,L376833,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes.
220974,L376829,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes.
220975,L376828,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I guess you have your reasons.
220976,L376827,u6551,m435,JOE,Not exactly.
220977,L376826,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Thank you.
220978,L376825,u6551,m435,JOE,"Happy Birthday, Bill."
220979,L376782,u6551,m435,JOE,An indictable offense.
220980,L376781,u6552,m435,PARRISH,An offense --
220981,L376780,u6551,m435,JOE,Undisclosed conflict of interest --
220982,L376779,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --"
220983,L376778,u6551,m435,JOE,And we're very grateful.
220984,L376777,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate."
220985,L376775,u6552,m435,PARRISH,-- An IRS man.
220986,L376774,u6551,m435,JOE,I'll take it from here --  I am --
220987,L376773,u6552,m435,PARRISH,He is --
220988,L376772,u6551,m435,JOE,"Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --"
220989,L376771,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I told you to shut up.
220990,L376767,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --"
220991,L376766,u6551,m435,JOE,It's time to put this person where he belongs.
220992,L376765,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Joe, don't do this --"
220993,L376746,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Get him in here.
220994,L376745,u6551,m435,JOE,Okay.
220995,L376715,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life."
220996,L376714,u6551,m435,JOE,Are you threatening me?
220997,L376713,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't expect you to.
220998,L376712,u6551,m435,JOE,I don't like what you're saying.
220999,L376711,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Does she know where she's going?
221000,L376710,u6551,m435,JOE,No.
221001,L376709,u6552,m435,PARRISH,With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
221002,L376708,u6551,m435,JOE,Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
221003,L376707,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well, they're mine now."
221004,L376706,u6551,m435,JOE,"Those were my words, Bill."
221005,L376705,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
221006,L376704,u6551,m435,JOE,So that's what love is?
221007,L376703,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love."
221008,L376702,u6551,m435,JOE,Which is what?
221009,L376701,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters."
221010,L376700,u6551,m435,JOE,Then what is it?
221011,L376699,u6552,m435,PARRISH,How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
221012,L376698,u6551,m435,JOE,"I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand."
221013,L376697,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted."
221014,L376696,u6551,m435,JOE,"I'm sorry, Bill --"
221015,L376695,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
221016,L376694,u6551,m435,JOE,"I think you heard me, Bill."
221017,L376693,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You're what?
221018,L376692,u6551,m435,JOE,"I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight."
221019,L376691,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Say again?
221020,L376690,u6551,m435,JOE,-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
221021,L376689,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death."
221022,L376688,u6551,m435,JOE,"I was just asking, Bill."
221023,L376687,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What the hell do you care?
221024,L376686,u6551,m435,JOE,Not at all.
221025,L376685,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Thanks.
221026,L376588,u6551,m435,JOE,"Good.  Tomorrow, after the party."
221027,L376587,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yeah.
221028,L376586,u6551,m435,JOE,You are?
221029,L376585,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"What are you saying, that it's time to go?"
221030,L376584,u6551,m435,JOE,"-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose."
221031,L376583,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yes?
221032,L376582,u6551,m435,JOE,Uh --
221033,L376525,u6551,m435,JOE,"I told you, 'watch it'."
221034,L376524,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
221035,L376523,u6551,m435,JOE,"May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill."
221036,L376522,u6552,m435,PARRISH,And I don't give a shit.
221037,L376521,u6551,m435,JOE,"I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references."
221038,L376520,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up."
221039,L376519,u6551,m435,JOE,This universe?
221040,L376518,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You're violating the laws of the universe.
221041,L376515,u6551,m435,JOE,"I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable."
221042,L376514,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --"
221043,L376513,u6551,m435,JOE,'Spooning'?
221044,L376512,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter."
221045,L376511,u6551,m435,JOE,"With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission."
221046,L376510,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I'm her father!
221047,L376509,u6551,m435,JOE,I'll be the judge of that.
221048,L376508,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman."
221049,L376507,u6551,m435,JOE,"Yes, I saw you see me."
221050,L376505,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm sorry to hear that.
221051,L376504,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I couldn't sleep.
221052,L376478,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Then I can't help you.
221053,L376477,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm not hungry.
221054,L376476,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
221055,L376475,u6551,m435,JOE,'Fish'?
221056,L376474,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?"
221057,L376473,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Just a manner of speaking.
221058,L376472,u6551,m435,JOE,What's okay?
221059,L376471,u6552,m435,PARRISH,That's okay.
221060,L376470,u6551,m435,JOE,"I'm sorry, Bill --"
221061,L376425,u6551,m435,JOE,Goodnight.
221062,L376424,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Okay.  Goodnight.
221063,L376423,u6551,m435,JOE,Um -- not right now.
221064,L376422,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?"
221065,L376421,u6551,m435,JOE,"Hello, Bill."
221066,L376289,u6551,m435,JOE,"Are you going to fire me, Bill?"
221067,L376288,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire."
221068,L376287,u6551,m435,JOE,"You tell me, Bill."
221069,L376286,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What way would you put it?
221070,L376285,u6551,m435,JOE,I wouldn't put it that way.
221071,L376284,u6552,m435,PARRISH,About Susan?
221072,L376283,u6551,m435,JOE,I guess...
221073,L376282,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You were just curious?
221074,L376281,u6551,m435,JOE,I don't know.
221075,L376280,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Why did you go to the hospital?
221076,L376176,u6551,m435,JOE,"Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation."
221077,L376175,u6552,m435,PARRISH,And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
221078,L376174,u6551,m435,JOE,Okay.
221079,L376173,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?"
221080,L376172,u6551,m435,JOE,"Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?"
221081,L376170,u6551,m435,JOE,Absolutely.
221082,L376169,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Dinner?  Absolutely.
221083,L376152,u6551,m435,JOE,This part I'm interested in.
221084,L376151,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
221085,L376150,u6551,m435,JOE,Well...I don't know.
221086,L376149,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Why didn't you stop me?
221087,L376148,u6551,m435,JOE,And more.
221088,L376147,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that."
221089,L376146,u6551,m435,JOE,Uh-huh.
221090,L376145,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
221091,L376144,u6551,m435,JOE,Truly - uh - splendid.
221092,L376143,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
221093,L376142,u6551,m435,JOE,Excellent.  What is it?
221094,L376141,u6552,m435,PARRISH,It's all yours.
221095,L376140,u6551,m435,JOE,Are you going to eat your lunch
221096,L376079,u6551,m435,JOE,"No thank you, Bill.  I can manage."
221097,L376078,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city."
221098,L376075,u6551,m435,JOE,Oh.  Okay.
221099,L376074,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Now I'd like to be alone.
221100,L376073,u6551,m435,JOE,Of course.
221101,L376072,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you."
221102,L376071,u6551,m435,JOE,"You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?"
221103,L376070,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?"
221104,L376069,u6551,m435,JOE,"Are you sad, Bill?"
221105,L376068,u6552,m435,PARRISH,...I'd like to be alone for a while.
221106,L376067,u6551,m435,JOE,I don't understand.
221107,L376066,u6552,m435,PARRISH,-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
221108,L376040,u6551,m435,JOE,Yes.
221109,L376039,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Would you like to sit down, Joe?"
221110,L376028,u6551,m435,JOE,I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
221111,L376027,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
221112,L376026,u6551,m435,JOE,No.
221113,L376025,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
221114,L376016,u6551,m435,JOE,So can I.
221115,L376015,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yes.
221116,L376014,u6551,m435,JOE,Can you keep a secret?
221117,L376013,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What's it like where I'm going?
221118,L376012,u6551,m435,JOE,What do you mean?
221119,L376011,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What's it like?
221120,L376010,u6551,m435,JOE,I understand.
221121,L376009,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I want to live.
221122,L376008,u6551,m435,JOE,That's what everybody says.
221123,L376007,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I'm not everybody.
221124,L376006,u6551,m435,JOE,That's what everybody says.
221125,L376005,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --"
221126,L376004,u6551,m435,JOE,Not this.
221127,L376003,u6552,m435,PARRISH,There's one to every rule.
221128,L376002,u6551,m435,JOE,Make an exception?
221129,L376001,u6552,m435,PARRISH,How about giving a guy a break?
221130,L376000,u6551,m435,JOE,"Yes, Bill."
221131,L375999,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Joe --?
221132,L375998,u6551,m435,JOE,"So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about."
221133,L375997,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Of course.
221134,L375996,u6551,m435,JOE,"So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere."
221135,L375995,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I guess so.
221136,L375994,u6551,m435,JOE,"You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?"
221137,L375993,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What do you mean?
221138,L375992,u6551,m435,JOE,"When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?"
221139,L375989,u6551,m435,JOE,You've got a deal.
221140,L375988,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yes?
221141,L375987,u6551,m435,JOE,Bill --
221142,L375986,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people."
221143,L375985,u6551,m435,JOE,A 'deal'?
221144,L375984,u6552,m435,PARRISH,It is a deal?
221145,L375983,u6551,m435,JOE,Sounds fair enough.
221146,L375982,u6552,m435,PARRISH,And I won't tell anyone who you are.
221147,L375981,u6551,m435,JOE,And what?
221148,L375979,u6551,m435,JOE,"Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly."
221149,L375978,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?"
221150,L375977,u6551,m435,JOE,'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
221151,L375976,u6552,m435,PARRISH,How are you?  How're you feeling?
221152,L375975,u6551,m435,JOE,"Good morning, Bill."
221153,L375974,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Good morning.
221154,L375922,u6551,m435,JOE,"Good night to you, Bill."
221155,L375921,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'."
221156,L375920,u6551,m435,JOE,Not at all.
221157,L375919,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well, thank you for letting me know."
221158,L375918,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Closer than that.
221159,L375917,u6551,m435,JOE,"I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time."
221160,L375916,u6552,m435,PARRISH,No --
221161,L375915,u6551,m435,JOE,"Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?"
221162,L375914,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine."
221163,L375913,u6551,m435,JOE,"That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering."
221164,L375912,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"When you go, I go."
221165,L375911,u6551,m435,JOE,"You're putting me on the spot, Bill."
221166,L375910,u6552,m435,PARRISH,How long have I got?
221167,L375909,u6551,m435,JOE,I won't.
221168,L375908,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"If there is anything else, don't hesitate --"
221169,L375907,u6551,m435,JOE,No.
221170,L375906,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
221171,L375905,u6551,m435,JOE,What a good idea.
221172,L375902,u6551,m435,JOE,"It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?"
221173,L375901,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
221174,L375900,u6551,m435,JOE,No.
221175,L375899,u6552,m435,PARRISH,So there's nothing between you and Susan?
221176,L375898,u6551,m435,JOE,I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
221177,L375897,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
221178,L375896,u6551,m435,JOE,'Threw' you?  Where?
221179,L375895,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me."
221180,L375891,u6551,m435,JOE,Thank you.
221181,L375890,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Joe, that's the kitchen."
221182,L375847,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --"
221183,L375846,u6551,m435,JOE,No --
221184,L375811,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,Then don't.
221185,L375810,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner."
221186,L375809,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,"Speak up, please."
221187,L375808,u6552,m435,PARRISH,It just occurred to me --
221188,L375807,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,Of course.
221189,L375806,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Excuse me?  Could I say something?
221190,L375805,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,"Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?"
221191,L375804,u6552,m435,PARRISH,This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
221192,L375801,u6552,m435,PARRISH,And then --?
221193,L375800,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,You should hope quite a while.
221194,L375799,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I do?  How long will you be staying?
221195,L375798,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,"You fill the bill, Bill."
221196,L375797,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You want me to be your guide --?
221197,L375796,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
221198,L375795,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
221199,L375794,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,That's me.
221200,L375793,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Death!
221201,L375792,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,Yes.
221202,L375790,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,'...Yes --'
221203,L375789,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You are --?
221204,L375788,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
221205,L375787,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,I am not a dream.
221206,L375786,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
221207,L375783,u6556,m435,VOICE,"Yes, Bill.  The question."
221208,L375782,u6552,m435,PARRISH,The 'question' --
221209,L375781,u6556,m435,VOICE,"Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --"
221210,L375780,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What question?
221211,L375779,u6556,m435,VOICE,'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
221212,L375778,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yes what?
221213,L375777,u6556,m435,VOICE,"In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested."
221214,L375776,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I'm sorry --
221215,L375775,u6556,m435,VOICE,Watch it!
221216,L375774,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What the hell are you talking about?
221217,L375773,u6556,m435,VOICE,Time.
221218,L375772,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Get what?

221220,L375770,u6552,m435,PARRISH,'The one' to do what?
221221,L375769,u6556,m435,VOICE,"It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one."
221222,L375768,u6552,m435,PARRISH,'Take me'...?  Where?
221223,L375767,u6556,m435,VOICE,I want to have a look around before I take you.
221224,L375766,u6552,m435,PARRISH,About what?
221225,L375765,u6556,m435,VOICE,"Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you."
221226,L375764,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What the hell is this?  Who are you?
221227,L375763,u6556,m435,VOICE,"The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --"
221228,L375761,u6556,m435,VOICE,Quiet.
221229,L375760,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --"
221230,L375759,u6556,m435,VOICE,I'm here.
221231,L375758,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Where are you?
221232,L375701,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Know what?  Know what, goddammit!"
221233,L375700,u6556,m435,VOICE,I think you know --
221234,L375699,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What do you mean?!
221235,L375698,u6556,m435,VOICE,There's going to be plenty of time for that.
221236,L375697,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Please.  Talk to me --
221237,L375696,u6556,m435,VOICE,It's enough now.
221238,L375695,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Where are you?  Are you there?
221239,L375694,u6556,m435,VOICE,"No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle."
221240,L375693,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I'm sorry, I --"
221241,L375692,u6556,m435,VOICE,Are you giving me orders?
221242,L375690,u6556,m435,VOICE,What you were talking about.
221243,L375689,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What are you talking about?
221244,L375688,u6556,m435,VOICE,"Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'."
221245,L375687,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't!
221246,L375686,u6556,m435,VOICE,I think you know --
221247,L375684,u6556,m435,VOICE,I believe you did.
221248,L375683,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I didn't ask any question.
221249,L375682,u6556,m435,VOICE,'Yes' is the answer to your question.
221250,L375681,u6552,m435,PARRISH,'Yes' what?
221251,L375611,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What?
221252,L375610,u6556,m435,VOICE,"'...I know, it's none of my business.'"
221253,L376684,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Sir, I'll deliver the package."
221254,L376683,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Quince, I've got confidence in you."
221255,L376682,u6553,m435,QUINCE,You think Drew will go for it?
221256,L376681,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings."
221257,L376676,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Yes, I believe I do."
221258,L376675,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?"
221259,L376674,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Sure.
221260,L376673,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?"
221261,L376671,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong."
221262,L376670,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --"
221263,L376366,u6553,m435,QUINCE,The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
221264,L376365,u6552,m435,PARRISH,This one.
221265,L376361,u6553,m435,QUINCE,See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
221266,L376360,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Yeah, I give a shit."
221267,L376359,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?"
221268,L376357,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?"
221269,L376356,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world."
221270,L376189,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner."
221271,L376188,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe."
221272,L376187,u6553,m435,QUINCE,Yeah.  Or the week after.
221273,L376186,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Next week?
221274,L376185,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week."
221275,L376184,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Thank you, Quince."
221276,L376183,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent."
221277,L375564,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants."
221278,L375563,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"How's that, Quince?"
221279,L375562,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"I am, this is it.  B Day."
221280,L375561,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I'm doing great.  You ready?
221281,L375560,u6553,m435,QUINCE,How're you doing--?
221282,L375559,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Good morning, Quince."
221283,L375558,u6553,m435,QUINCE,"Hi, Bill --"
221284,L376793,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you."
221285,L376792,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight."
221286,L376756,u6554,m435,SLOANE,We're all ears.
221287,L376755,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks."
221288,L376754,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"We're all here, Bill --"
221289,L376599,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory."
221290,L376598,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?"
221291,L376597,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it."
221292,L376596,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede."
221293,L376595,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --"
221294,L376594,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope."
221295,L376593,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?"
221296,L376592,u6554,m435,SLOANE,Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
221297,L376591,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Eddie?
221298,L376461,u6554,m435,SLOANE,I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
221299,L376460,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie."
221300,L376459,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?"
221301,L376458,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"" shit."
221302,L376457,u6554,m435,SLOANE,"...It's not over, 'til it's over."
221303,L376061,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?"
221304,L376060,u6554,m435,SLOANE,Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
221305,L376823,u6555,m435,SUSAN,The fireworks are about to start.
221306,L376822,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What was that?
221307,L376817,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old."
221308,L376816,u6552,m435,PARRISH,If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
221309,L376815,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Oh, yes --"
221310,L376814,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?"
221311,L376810,u6552,m435,PARRISH,That's why it's okay.
221312,L376809,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"I love you, Daddy --"
221313,L376808,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets."
221314,L376807,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Daddy --
221315,L376806,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me."
221316,L376805,u6555,m435,SUSAN,But what?
221317,L376804,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Yes, but --"
221318,L376803,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Are you relieved?
221319,L376802,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I'm sorry.
221320,L376801,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --"
221321,L376800,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I'm having a helluva time.
221322,L376799,u6555,m435,SUSAN,What a night.
221323,L376574,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
221324,L376573,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I love him.
221325,L376572,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground."
221326,L376571,u6555,m435,SUSAN,C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
221327,L376570,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I don't know, I can't say --"
221328,L376569,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Where's he going?
221329,L376568,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long."
221330,L376567,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not."
221331,L376566,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You don't know anything about Joe --
221332,L376565,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?"
221333,L376564,u6552,m435,PARRISH,This is crazy --
221334,L376563,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived."
221335,L376562,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't understand.
221336,L376561,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe."
221337,L376560,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't know.
221338,L376559,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Where is he?
221339,L376558,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Joe?
221340,L376557,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Where's Joe?
221341,L376329,u6555,m435,SUSAN,It's something.
221342,L376328,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Then what is it?
221343,L376327,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing."
221344,L376326,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Nothing.
221345,L376325,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
221346,L376324,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --"
221347,L376323,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Then what will you say?
221348,L376322,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
221349,L376321,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Well, remember how you told me about ""lightning striking""?  The nature of it's in there somewhere."
221350,L376320,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
221351,L376319,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Raise away.
221352,L376318,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
221353,L376317,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Yeah, it's good to get together."
221354,L376316,u6552,m435,PARRISH,That was wonderful.
221355,L376239,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Will it?...
221356,L376238,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"It'll come back, Daddy."
221357,L375888,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go."
221358,L375887,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter."
221359,L375877,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Incidentally, 'Joe' what?"
221360,L375876,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Uh - will that hold you, Joe?"
221361,L375866,u6555,m435,SUSAN,-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
221362,L375865,u6552,m435,PARRISH,What?!
221363,L375864,u6555,m435,SUSAN,We've met.
221364,L375863,u6552,m435,PARRISH,You know each other?
221365,L375625,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Yer damn right.
221366,L375624,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Well, go get 'em, Pops."
221367,L375623,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action."
221368,L375622,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Are you okay?
221369,L375620,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Nothing.
221370,L375619,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"What is it, Daddy --?"
221371,L375617,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Nothing.  I'm sorry.
221372,L375616,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Daddy, what's the matter?"

221374,L375605,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Thank God.
221375,L375604,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
221376,L375603,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You're terrible.
221377,L375602,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton."
221378,L375601,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either."

221380,L375599,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.

221382,L375597,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Bravo.
221383,L375596,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived."
221384,L375595,u6555,m435,SUSAN,'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
221385,L375594,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
221386,L375593,u6555,m435,SUSAN,That's all?

221389,L375590,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice."
221390,L375589,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You're not listening --
221391,L375588,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say."
221392,L375587,u6555,m435,SUSAN,So what's wrong with that?
221393,L375586,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it."
221394,L375585,u6555,m435,SUSAN,What were you going to say?
221395,L375584,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Well, I wasn't going to say that --"
221396,L375583,u6555,m435,SUSAN,And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
221397,L375582,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --"
221398,L375581,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Uh oh --
221399,L375580,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Don't get carried away.
221400,L375579,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Probably.
221401,L375578,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
221402,L375577,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You mean like you loved Mom?
221403,L375576,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Do you love Drew?
221404,L375574,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I know it's none of my business --

221406,L375572,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I am.  With you.
221407,L375571,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I thought you were in a meeting--?
221408,L375570,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
221409,L375569,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You're only six-five once.
221410,L375568,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Not my birthday again?
221411,L375538,u6555,m435,SUSAN,...Then don't.
221412,L375537,u6552,m435,PARRISH,I don't like to interfere.
221413,L375536,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Yeah.  I guess so.
221414,L375535,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"You like him, don't you?"
221415,L375534,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I hope so.
221416,L375533,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Does Drew tell you everything?
221417,L375532,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Drew told me.
221418,L375531,u6552,m435,PARRISH,How did you know?
221419,L375530,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
221420,L375524,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --"
221421,L375523,u6552,m435,PARRISH,Drew's aboard?
221422,L375520,u6552,m435,PARRISH,"Hi, honey."

221427,L376850,u6555,m435,SUSAN,No --

221431,L375721,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you."
221432,L375720,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,"Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?"
221433,L375719,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Why?
221434,L375718,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
221435,L375717,u6555,m435,SUSAN,"No, it was so right it scares me."
221436,L375716,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,Did I say something wrong?
221437,L375715,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I've got to go --
221438,L375714,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,You never know.  Lightning could strike.
221439,L375713,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
221440,L375712,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,I would.
221441,L375711,u6555,m435,SUSAN,You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
221442,L375710,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,"I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --"
221443,L375709,u6555,m435,SUSAN,'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
221444,L375708,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,...It's kind of a pro bono job.
221445,L375669,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,"And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?"
221446,L375668,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I've got patients coming in --

221452,L375662,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I could be her.

221454,L375660,u6555,m435,SUSAN,Me?  Internal medicine.
221455,L375659,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
221456,L375658,u6555,m435,SUSAN,How'd you know?
221457,L375657,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.

221466,L375648,u6555,m435,SUSAN,I'm sorry --
221467,L375647,u6557,m435,YOUNG MAN,My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.

221553,L376905,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99"
221554,L376904,u6560,m436,BURT,Burt.
221555,L376903,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I'm sorry... um... ?
221556,L376902,u6560,m436,BURT,"What can I do for you, Leonard?"
221557,L376901,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
221558,L376900,u6560,m436,BURT,Hiya.
221559,L377220,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I forget.
221560,L377219,u6561,m436,DODD,I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
221561,L377218,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Interested in buying one?
221562,L377217,u6561,m436,DODD,Where'd you get it?
221563,L377216,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Thanks.
221564,L377215,u6561,m436,DODD,I like your car.
221565,L377201,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Don't be too hard on yourself.
221566,L377200,u6561,m436,DODD,I haven't made a strong enough impression.
221567,L377150,u6561,m436,DODD,You did.
221568,L377149,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Who did this to you?
221569,L377148,u6561,m436,DODD,What?
221570,L377535,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I don't want your fucking money!
221571,L377534,u6562,m436,JIMMY,Take the money and walk away!
221572,L377533,u6563,m436,LEONARD,You think you can bargain with me?!
221573,L377532,u6562,m436,JIMMY,"Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!"
221574,L377531,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Strip!
221575,L377530,u6562,m436,JIMMY,Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
221576,L377529,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I don't want blood on them.
221577,L377528,u6562,m436,JIMMY,Why?
221578,L377527,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Quiet!
221579,L377526,u6562,m436,JIMMY,I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
221580,L377525,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Don't say anything else.
221581,L377524,u6562,m436,JIMMY,You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
221582,L377520,u6562,m436,JIMMY,"Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?"
221583,L377519,u6563,m436,LEONARD,You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
221584,L377518,u6562,m436,JIMMY,"Yeah, I remember you."
221585,L377517,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Do you remember me?
221586,L377516,u6562,m436,JIMMY,What the fuck are you doing here?
221587,L377515,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Jimmy?
221588,L377447,u6567,m436,NATALIE,So why did you come here?
221589,L377446,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before."
221590,L377445,u6567,m436,NATALIE,You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
221591,L377444,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I don't know. I'm sorry.
221592,L377442,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I don't know.
221593,L377441,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Did Teddy send you?
221594,L377440,u6563,m436,LEONARD,My name's Leonard.							 *
221595,L377439,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Are you Teddy?
221596,L377438,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
221597,L377437,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
221598,L377436,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Who's your boyfriend?
221599,L377435,u6567,m436,NATALIE,My boyfriend told me about you.
221600,L377434,u6563,m436,LEONARD,How do you know about me?
221601,L377433,u6567,m436,NATALIE,You're the memory guy?
221602,L377432,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *"
221603,L377431,u6567,m436,NATALIE,You tell me.
221604,L377430,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Oh. But haven't we met before?
221605,L377429,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"Well, that's me."
221606,L377428,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
221607,L377427,u6567,m436,NATALIE,What are you here for?
221608,L377426,u6563,m436,LEONARD,There's a dress code?
221609,L377425,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
221610,L377424,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"A BEER, please."
221611,L377423,u6567,m436,NATALIE,What do you want?
221612,L377422,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"Beer, please."
221613,L377419,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I remember my wife dying.
221614,L377418,u6567,m436,NATALIE,What?
221615,L377417,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Dying.
221616,L377416,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Sweet.
221617,L377415,u6563,m436,LEONARD,My wife.
221618,L377411,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Thanks.
221619,L377410,u6567,m436,NATALIE,On the house.
221620,L377397,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Thank you.
221621,L377396,u6567,m436,NATALIE,You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
221622,L377395,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *"
221623,L377394,u6567,m436,NATALIE,How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
221624,L377389,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Why not?
221625,L377388,u6563,m436,LEONARD,They're not looking for him.
221626,L377387,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Can I ask you something?
221627,L377386,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*"
221628,L377380,u6567,m436,NATALIE,About your whore of a wife?
221629,L377379,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Don't say another fucking word!
221630,L377376,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Shut the fuck up!
221631,L377375,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard."
221632,L377374,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Yes.
221633,L377373,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!"
221634,L377372,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"Just take it easy, this isn't my fault."
221635,L377371,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!"
221636,L377370,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Calm down.
221637,L377369,u6567,m436,NATALIE,I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
221638,L377368,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Don't talk about my wife.
221639,L377365,u6563,m436,LEONARD,That's different.
221640,L377364,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?"
221641,L377363,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
221642,L377362,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Kill him. I'll pay you.
221643,L377361,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What?
221644,L377360,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Get rid of Dodd for me.
221645,L377359,u6563,m436,LEONARD,How?
221646,L377358,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Help me.
221647,L377357,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I'm not.
221648,L377356,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Don't protect him.
221649,L377355,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Neither do I.
221650,L377354,u6567,m436,NATALIE,What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
221651,L377353,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What happened?
221652,L377350,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I have this condition -
221653,L377349,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?"
221654,L377348,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What's this all about?
221655,L377347,u6567,m436,NATALIE,No!
221656,L377346,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Did you?
221657,L377345,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
221658,L377344,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What does he want?
221659,L377343,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Calls himself Dodd.
221660,L377342,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Who?
221661,L377341,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Somebody's come. Already.
221662,L377340,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What's wrong?
221663,L377335,u6567,m436,NATALIE,He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
221664,L377334,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Why would you do that?
221665,L377333,u6567,m436,NATALIE,I told him about your car.
221666,L377332,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Me? Why would he be interested in me?
221667,L377330,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else."
221668,L377329,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"Yeah, I hated it."
221669,L377328,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Yeah?
221670,L377327,u6563,m436,LEONARD,My wife used to call me Lenny.
221671,L377326,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"He'll kill you, Lenny."
221672,L377325,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
221673,L377324,u6567,m436,NATALIE,And?
221674,L377323,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I'll go see him.
221675,L377322,u6567,m436,NATALIE,What are you gonna do?
221676,L377321,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Where is he?
221677,L377320,u6567,m436,NATALIE,He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
221678,L377319,u6563,m436,LEONARD,And what did he say?
221679,L377318,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything."
221680,L377314,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me."
221681,L377313,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Who?
221682,L377125,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
221683,L377124,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Kill him.
221684,L377123,u6567,m436,NATALIE,They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
221685,L377122,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What do the police think?
221686,L377120,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Who did he go to meet?
221687,L377119,u6567,m436,NATALIE,He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
221688,L377118,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What happened?
221689,L377117,u6567,m436,NATALIE,His name was Jimmy.
221690,L377113,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Just relax.
221691,L377112,u6563,m436,LEONARD,It's not easy to be calm when -
221692,L377109,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes."
221693,L377108,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Your wife?
221694,L377107,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her."
221695,L377106,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Such as?
221696,L377105,u6563,m436,LEONARD,There are things you know for sure.
221697,L377104,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure."
221698,L377100,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Course not.
221699,L377099,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Kill him.
221700,L377098,u6563,m436,LEONARD,What?
221701,L377097,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Did you?
221702,L377096,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
221703,L377095,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Yes.
221704,L377094,u6563,m436,LEONARD,So I just take your word?
221705,L377093,u6567,m436,NATALIE,I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
221706,L377092,u6563,m436,LEONARD,How do I know he did that to you?
221707,L377091,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me."
221708,L377090,u6563,m436,LEONARD,That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
221709,L377089,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation."
221710,L377086,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Who is he? What have you got me into?
221711,L377085,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
221712,L377062,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Yeah. You?
221713,L377061,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Sleep okay?
221714,L376984,u6567,m436,NATALIE,You know what we have in common?
221715,L376983,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Don't remember.
221716,L376982,u6567,m436,NATALIE,They treating you alright?
221717,L376978,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Sorry.
221718,L376977,u6567,m436,NATALIE,I wasn't helping you for money.
221719,L376976,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
221720,L376975,u6567,m436,NATALIE,It's isolated.
221721,L376974,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Deals?
221722,L376973,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals."
221723,L376970,u6563,m436,LEONARD,She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
221724,L376969,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
221725,L376968,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Why?
221726,L376967,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Tell me about her again.
221727,L376966,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *"
221728,L376965,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened."
221729,L376964,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Then you shouldn't have to ask.
221730,L376963,u6567,m436,NATALIE,Yes.
221731,L376962,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Have I told you what this man did?				*
221732,L376961,u6567,m436,NATALIE,No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
221733,L376960,u6563,m436,LEONARD,You know him?
221734,L376957,u6567,m436,NATALIE,"Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear."
221735,L376956,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Yes.

221905,L377033,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?"
221906,L377032,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?"
221907,L377031,u6568,m436,TEDDY,You don't have to remember to be hungry.
221908,L377030,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts."
221909,L377028,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch."
221910,L377027,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Guess I've told you about my condition.
221911,L377026,u6568,m436,TEDDY,So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
221912,L377025,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Things change.
221913,L377024,u6568,m436,TEDDY,You said you were leaving town.
221914,L377023,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
221915,L376944,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I'll be waiting.							   *
221916,L376943,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over."
221917,L376942,u6563,m436,LEONARD,John Gammell?
221918,L376941,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"Lenny, is that you?"
221919,L376940,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Mr Gammell?
221920,L376939,u6568,m436,TEDDY,Yup?
221921,L376896,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I don't remember.
221922,L376895,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?"
221923,L376894,u6563,m436,LEONARD,You know it?
221924,L376893,u6568,m436,TEDDY,What the hell you want to go there for?
221925,L376887,u6563,m436,LEONARD,You're in a playful mood.
221926,L376886,u6568,m436,TEDDY,This is your car.
221927,L376883,u6563,m436,LEONARD,I guess I've told you about my condition.
221928,L376882,u6568,m436,TEDDY,Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
221929,L376876,u6568,m436,TEDDY,Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
221930,L376875,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Shut your mouth!
221931,L376874,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"That's who you were, you don't know who you are."
221932,L376873,u6563,m436,LEONARD,"I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -"
221933,L376870,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Teddy!
221934,L376869,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name."
221935,L376868,u6563,m436,LEONARD,Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
221936,L377609,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *"
221937,L377608,u6564,m436,LEONARD							  *,* Thank you.							    *
221938,L377567,u6568,m436,TEDDY,A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
221939,L377566,u6564,m436,LEONARD							  *,What was it for?							   *
221940,L377563,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *"
221941,L377562,u6564,m436,LEONARD							  *,Bullshit.							*
221942,L377491,u6568,m436,TEDDY,"This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *"
221943,L377490,u6564,m436,LEONARD							  *,What cop?
221944,L377164,u6568,m436,TEDDY,Why would I have a gun?
221945,L377163,u6564,m436,LEONARD							  *,"Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *"
221946,L379940,u6569,m437,BARTENDER,With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
221947,L379939,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Doing...?
221948,L379938,u6569,m437,BARTENDER,No.  I was in Namibia...
221949,L379937,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
221950,L379936,u6569,m437,BARTENDER,Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
221951,L379935,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?"
221952,L379934,u6569,m437,BARTENDER,Lemon or lime?
221953,L379933,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
221954,L380552,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
221955,L380551,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
221956,L380548,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,"There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that..."
221957,L380547,u6581,m437,TUBBS,She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
221958,L380538,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,"They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?"
221959,L380537,u6581,m437,TUBBS,They'll kill Gina.
221960,L380387,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
221961,L380386,u6581,m437,TUBBS,With Sonny.  110%.
221962,L380096,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
221963,L380095,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Oh, yeah..."
221964,L380094,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,He any good?
221965,L380093,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Sal Maguda.
221966,L380087,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,"I got to know.  There is never any room for ""personal""..."
221967,L380086,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"""And"" what?"
221968,L380085,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,And...?
221969,L380084,u6581,m437,TUBBS,I was the kids' godfather.
221970,L380083,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,"About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them."
221971,L380042,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Grieve elsewhere.
221972,L380041,u6581,m437,TUBBS,We know these people...!
221973,L380040,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Turn around.
221974,L380039,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
221975,L380038,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,What's your twenty?
221976,L380037,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Yeah.
221977,L380546,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
221978,L380545,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Just came in.  She's still alive.
221979,L380536,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,You can't.
221980,L380535,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
221981,L380534,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,It's a rip and a hit.
221982,L380533,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,What do you think?
221983,L380532,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
221984,L380531,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Where's the new drop point...?
221985,L380530,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
221986,L380529,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Yeah?
221987,L380092,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
221988,L380091,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Okay.  What'd you spot...?
221989,L380089,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Good.
221990,L380088,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it."
221991,L380062,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Recruit us to do what?
221992,L380061,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,"...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not..."
221993,L380391,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,"No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?"
221994,L380390,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,I got to talk to my ADO...
221995,L380389,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Yes you do...
221996,L380388,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,I don't know.
221997,L380082,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on..."
221998,L380081,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
221999,L380080,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,Sure.
222000,L380079,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,"...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya..."
222001,L380078,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,You need to consider a few issues.
222002,L380052,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us."
222003,L380051,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,Tell them what you want.
222004,L380050,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that."
222005,L380045,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,We're not certain!
222006,L380044,u6570,m437,CASTILLO,You said Nazi Low-riders...?
222007,L380043,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,We're not certain...
222008,L380504,u6571,m437,COLEMAN,Deal.
222009,L380503,u6573,m437,EL TIBURON,Make it 35.
222010,L380502,u6571,m437,COLEMAN,Make it 40%.
222011,L380501,u6573,m437,EL TIBURON,25% discount on the load.
222012,L380500,u6571,m437,COLEMAN,My end?
222013,L380499,u6573,m437,EL TIBURON,Two main players plus three.
222014,L380498,u6571,m437,COLEMAN,How many?
222015,L380497,u6573,m437,EL TIBURON,And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
222016,L380496,u6571,m437,COLEMAN,I got the item.
222017,L380495,u6573,m437,EL TIBURON,"Okay.  You got the ""item""?"
222018,L380494,u6571,m437,COLEMAN,"All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit."
222019,L380493,u6573,m437,EL TIBURON,Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
222020,L380492,u6571,m437,COLEMAN,So...?
222021,L380588,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will."
222022,L380587,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I know.  And now?
222023,L380586,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,No part of it wasn't real.
222024,L380584,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,No.
222025,L380583,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?"
222026,L380554,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed."
222027,L380553,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,If they attack you...
222028,L380525,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
222029,L380524,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Yero, by himself?"
222030,L380479,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I'll be on board by noon.
222031,L380478,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,...in the morning.
222032,L380477,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load..."
222033,L380476,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you."
222034,L380475,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?"
222035,L380474,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
222036,L380473,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Is this the protective male talk?
222037,L380472,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
222038,L380471,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Where would I go?
222039,L380470,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Of course.
222040,L380469,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Would you find me...?
222041,L380468,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner."
222042,L380467,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,When?
222043,L380466,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
222044,L380465,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Really?
222045,L380464,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run..."
222046,L380463,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?"
222047,L380462,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
222048,L380461,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Do I need it?
222049,L380460,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance."
222050,L380459,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Why?
222051,L380458,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
222052,L380457,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, ""Live now because life is dust."""
222053,L380456,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"They're all the same.  ""Financial security is around the corner."" ""Your friends love you."""
222054,L380455,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,What's the best fortune you ever got?
222055,L380454,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
222056,L380453,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I forgot the napkins.
222057,L380424,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"Hola, viejo."
222058,L380423,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Hola, chica."
222059,L380342,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Maybe I'm only one.
222060,L380341,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
222061,L380340,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
222062,L380339,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Twenty-eight-point-five.
222063,L380338,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Available cash is not an issue for us...
222064,L380337,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front..."
222065,L380336,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
222066,L380334,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,And you're our thirty-percent partner?
222067,L380333,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free."
222068,L380332,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,'Cause you don't lose loads?
222069,L380331,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Zero risk.
222070,L380330,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Good samba dancing...?
222071,L380329,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  ""And why,"" you're thinking, ""would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?""  And the answer is, ""of course"" but also ""no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."""
222072,L380328,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Did Christmas come early this year...?
222073,L380327,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,What do you mean?
222074,L380326,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Is it December?
222075,L380325,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Cost less.  That's the point.
222076,L380324,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,And why should continuing excellence cost more?
222077,L380323,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Like ""three thousand a ki?""  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers."
222078,L380322,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Like...?
222079,L380319,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Exactly.
222080,L380318,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,...and therafore there is no consequence?
222081,L380317,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,That's right.
222082,L380316,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
222083,L380315,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"""Probable""...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here."
222084,L380314,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,You know how improbable this is...?
222085,L380313,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
222086,L380312,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Died in childbirth, having me..."
222087,L380311,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?"
222088,L380310,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business..."
222089,L380309,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I insist.
222090,L380308,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,No.
222091,L380307,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Tell <u>me</u> everything.
222092,L380305,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,I dance...
222093,L380304,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Later!  Do you dance?
222094,L380303,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Mojitas...?
222095,L380302,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
222096,L380301,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,How's he not your husband?
222097,L380300,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
222098,L380299,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Your father?
222099,L380298,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,She's dead...
222100,L380297,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Where's she now?
222101,L380296,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there..."
222102,L380295,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Were you born in Havana?
222103,L380294,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
222104,L380293,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,You do business in Cuba with your husband?
222105,L380292,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat..."
222106,L380290,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
222107,L380289,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
222108,L380288,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Havana.
222109,L380287,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,The Keys?
222110,L380286,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
222111,L380285,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Where's that?
222112,L380284,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
222113,L380283,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,So where's the best place for mojitas?
222114,L380279,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Show me...?
222115,L380278,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,It goes very fast.
222116,L380277,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,How fast does that go?
222117,L380276,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,I'm a fiend for mojitas.
222118,L380275,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,What do you like to drink?
222119,L380273,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,And what is that?
222120,L380272,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
222121,L380263,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Nothing.  As in ""free, gratis."""
222122,L380262,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"What's ""nothing""?"
222123,L380259,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
222124,L380258,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Okay.
222125,L380257,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,We want it back.
222126,L380185,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Right now.
222127,L380184,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,When?
222128,L380183,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,You do.
222129,L380182,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,I thought we had to meet the Man.
222130,L380176,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Really?  So, what is this, a party?"
222131,L380175,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here."
222132,L380514,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,'Cause she will tell you.
222133,L380513,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
222134,L380512,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,"Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you."
222135,L380511,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,What friend?
222136,L380510,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
222137,L380509,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it."
222138,L380508,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,"Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts."
222139,L380507,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Yeah?
222140,L380440,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
222141,L380439,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Packaging?
222142,L380256,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
222143,L380255,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?"
222144,L380254,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,What'd Neptune tell you?
222145,L380253,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
222146,L380249,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,And what do I do with him?
222147,L380248,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Yeah.
222148,L380243,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,I'll be there.
222149,L380242,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"He tried to...""do business""...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there."
222150,L380241,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,I do.  We don't do business with him...
222151,L380240,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"""Extras"" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of ""Things Aquatic""?"
222152,L380239,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,"Client got delivery.  But there were...""extras"" in the back of the truck."
222153,L380144,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,"I'm also called ""Cochi Loco.""  That means ""Crazy pig.""  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me..."
222154,L380143,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Red light, green light, Jos?"
222155,L380136,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"I am not John Wayne.  There is no ""S"" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money."
222156,L380135,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,You afraid of violence?
222157,L380118,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,"Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?"
222158,L380117,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,What...?
222159,L380113,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,Sit.
222160,L380112,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico."
222161,L380111,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,Jos...
222162,L380486,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Call the US Coast Guard:  ""Come and arrest our ass.""  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine..."
222163,L380485,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What's the point?  It's going down.
222164,L380484,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,What's your take?
222165,L380444,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"And Jos, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?"
222166,L380443,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy..."
222167,L380400,u6581,m437,TUBBS,I would never doubt you.
222168,L380399,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
222169,L380398,u6581,m437,TUBBS,I am asking.  You to me.
222170,L380397,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,You think I am in so deep I forgot?
222171,L380396,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"There is ""undercover.""  And there is ""Which way is up?"""
222172,L380395,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,As in...?
222173,L380394,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What is going on...?!
222174,L380382,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
222175,L380381,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Chill out Sonny.
222176,L380380,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Hey, fuck him."
222177,L380375,u6581,m437,TUBBS,So we want to change-up the mission statement.
222178,L380374,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
222179,L380373,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Their loads are poly-drug.  ""E"" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan ""H."" Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network."
222180,L380370,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
222181,L380369,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?"
222182,L380368,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
222183,L380361,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Oh, that makes it okay, then."
222184,L380360,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,We're makin' moves on each other.
222185,L380359,u6581,m437,TUBBS,You're not makin' a move on her...?
222186,L380358,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,No.
222187,L380357,u6581,m437,TUBBS,...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
222188,L380356,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?"
222189,L380355,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Havana, Cuba...?"
222190,L380354,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
222191,L380353,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Verdado where?
222192,L380352,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Verdado.
222193,L380351,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Where?
222194,L380350,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
222195,L380349,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Where'd you go?
222196,L380346,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,On my way back...
222197,L380345,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Where the hell are you, man?"
222198,L380261,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Nothing.
222199,L380260,u6581,m437,TUBBS,How much we looking for?
222200,L380219,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Good.  So let's go...
222201,L380218,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,No.
222202,L380217,u6581,m437,TUBBS,No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
222203,L380216,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
222204,L380215,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Like...?
222205,L380214,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?"
222206,L380213,u6581,m437,TUBBS,To the limit.
222207,L380172,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Who knows...

222209,L380167,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Five minutes...
222210,L380166,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,What do we got?
222211,L380165,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Port-Au-Prince.
222212,L380164,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Where we meeting 'em...?
222213,L380153,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Nothing.

222215,L380140,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?

222218,L380133,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  ""In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami.""  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away."
222219,L380132,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us."
222220,L380130,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What kind of weight?
222221,L380129,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
222222,L380126,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money..."
222223,L380125,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"""No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."""

222225,L380121,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
222226,L380120,u6581,m437,TUBBS,And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
222227,L380077,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
222228,L380076,u6581,m437,TUBBS,So?
222229,L380075,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"It says, ""We do not fear you.""  It says, ""Fuck off and die.""  It says, ""We get down for recreation..."""

222232,L380071,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
222233,L380049,u6581,m437,TUBBS,White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...

222238,L379978,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What is it?
222239,L379951,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Hello, Miss Ukraine..."
222240,L379950,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
222241,L379949,u6581,m437,TUBBS,And there's Dmitri...
222242,L379918,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
222243,L379917,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
222244,L379916,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Backup in case the Russians get physical.
222245,L379915,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,What's our deal?
222246,L380489,u6580,m437,TRUDY,"If you're down, we're down for the play."
222247,L380488,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Then you should.
222248,L380487,u6580,m437,TRUDY,"If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one..."
222249,L380482,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Switek?
222250,L380481,u6580,m437,TRUDY,Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
222251,L380480,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Go ahead.
222252,L379954,u6580,m437,TRUDY,"You're giving away your money, fool..."
222253,L379953,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Twenty on my man...
222254,L379952,u6580,m437,TRUDY,Eleven to seven he blows it.
222255,L380384,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
222256,L380383,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,Control your men.
222257,L380372,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
222258,L380371,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,Out of...?
222259,L380366,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
222260,L380365,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,What are you talking about?
222261,L380364,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Who's the ""we""?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  ""Low-level producer.""  Yeah, right..."
222262,L380363,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"Who said, ""go exploring""?  We want this staying on track."
222263,L380070,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think."
222264,L380069,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Never heard of him.
222265,L380068,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
222266,L380067,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,From whom...?
222267,L380064,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
222268,L380063,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there..."
222269,L380060,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,To recruit you.
222270,L380059,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,So what do you want?
222271,L380054,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,We don't know.
222272,L380053,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,How?
222273,L380012,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"NLR, we think.  I wanna know..."
222274,L380011,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?"
222275,L380007,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
222276,L380006,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,That's right.
222277,L380005,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
222278,L380004,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"Meet and greet.  ""I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"""
222279,L380003,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"""Buy and walk""?  ""Buy and bust""? ""Reverse undercover""?  What?"
222280,L380002,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"Guy's involved in a ""meet""..."
222281,L380001,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word ""foreboding""? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?"
222282,L380000,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,How do I discuss operations over an open line?
222283,L379999,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now..."
222284,L379998,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,Okay.  What's up?
222285,L379997,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
222286,L379996,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,What's your Miami PD badge number?
222287,L379995,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Detective Crockett.
222288,L379994,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,This is Agent James Fujima.
222289,L379993,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Hello?
222290,L380160,u6575,m437,GINA,"If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves..."
222291,L380159,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,How will it stand up?
222292,L380158,u6575,m437,GINA,"You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again..."
222293,L380155,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?"
222294,L380154,u6575,m437,GINA,"""Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."""
222295,L379921,u6575,m437,GINA,I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
222296,L379920,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Have faith.
222297,L379919,u6575,m437,GINA,"This I gotta see...  ...the ""make up an excuse and stop"" part."
222298,L380028,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!"
222299,L380027,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,How'd they get onto you?
222300,L379977,u6579,m437,STEVENS,Goodbye.
222301,L379976,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Alonzo...!
222302,L379975,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!"
222303,L379974,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Where are you?
222304,L379973,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know..."
222305,L379972,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,"Alonzo, what's goin' on?!"
222306,L379971,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em."
222307,L379970,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,I don't understand...
222308,L379969,u6579,m437,STEVENS,They had me from the gate.
222309,L379968,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
222310,L379967,u6579,m437,STEVENS,It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
222311,L379964,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny..."
222312,L379963,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,On the phone.
222313,L379962,u6579,m437,STEVENS,Where's Riccardo?
222314,L379961,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Yeah.
222315,L379960,u6579,m437,STEVENS,Sonny...?
222316,L379959,u6572,m437,CROCKETT,Yeah...?
222317,L380379,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization..."
222318,L380378,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,Who are you talking to?
222319,L380066,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"They got a steady stream of supply. So, no..."
222320,L380065,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
222321,L380058,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up."
222322,L380057,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"As in, your ass is dead in the water."
222323,L380056,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown."
222324,L380055,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
222325,L380047,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
222326,L380046,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"C'mon, man!"
222327,L380014,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,"...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said."
222328,L380013,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Oh, good..."
222329,L380010,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,White supremacist types.
222330,L380009,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?"
222331,L380008,u6574,m437,FUJIMA,Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
222332,L380211,u6575,m437,GINA,"...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine..."
222333,L380210,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool..."
222334,L380209,u6575,m437,GINA,"...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, ""We can reach out and touch somebody.""  Like Bad Teleflora."
222335,L380208,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
222336,L380207,u6575,m437,GINA,Okay.
222337,L380204,u6575,m437,GINA,"""Salutations from the south..."""
222338,L380203,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What's it say?
222339,L380202,u6575,m437,GINA,You mean with the flowers...?
222340,L380200,u6575,m437,GINA,"The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow."
222341,L380199,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What flowers?
222342,L380198,u6575,m437,GINA,...and thanks for the flowers.
222343,L380197,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Okay...see you soon.
222344,L380196,u6575,m437,GINA,Bored.
222345,L380195,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
222346,L380194,u6575,m437,GINA,Yes.  What's up?
222347,L380193,u6581,m437,TUBBS,You sure?
222348,L380192,u6575,m437,GINA,Yeah.
222349,L380191,u6581,m437,TUBBS,You okay?
222350,L380162,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
222351,L380161,u6575,m437,GINA,What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
222352,L379943,u6581,m437,TUBBS,He did volunteer one time...
222353,L379942,u6575,m437,GINA,"Only African he ever ""relocated"" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him..."
222354,L379923,u6575,m437,GINA,Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
222355,L379922,u6581,m437,TUBBS,So?
222356,L380421,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
222357,L380420,u6578,m437,MONTOYA,What would you do...?
222358,L380419,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"I think Jos suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too..."
222359,L380417,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious."
222360,L380416,u6578,m437,MONTOYA,Why?
222361,L380415,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good."
222362,L380414,u6578,m437,MONTOYA,And...?
222363,L380412,u6578,m437,MONTOYA,But what does your intuition tell you...?
222364,L380411,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
222365,L380410,u6578,m437,MONTOYA,Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
222366,L380409,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
222367,L380408,u6578,m437,MONTOYA,Not French registry?
222368,L380407,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
222369,L380406,u6578,m437,MONTOYA,Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
222370,L380405,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
222371,L380523,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too."
222372,L380522,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Meaning...?
222373,L380521,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story."
222374,L380517,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap."
222375,L380516,u6581,m437,TUBBS,You set this up!
222376,L380515,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,That sonofabitch!
222377,L380270,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
222378,L380269,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Conveyance?
222379,L380265,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"""Future"" of...?"
222380,L380264,u6581,m437,TUBBS,And as an investment in the future...
222381,L380181,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,"Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal."
222382,L380180,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Define small.
222383,L380179,u6576,m437,ISABELLA,I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
222384,L380442,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
222385,L380441,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
222386,L380435,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
222387,L380434,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
222388,L380433,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
222389,L380252,u6581,m437,TUBBS,You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
222390,L380251,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
222391,L380247,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
222392,L380246,u6581,m437,TUBBS,This the load you lost a while back?
222393,L380150,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,"Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from..."
222394,L380149,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
222395,L380146,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,I had to lay eyes on you.
222396,L380145,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Then what were we talking to you for?
222397,L380142,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Do we need this...?
222398,L380141,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,What do you care?
222399,L380138,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,"Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work."
222400,L380137,u6581,m437,TUBBS,And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
222401,L380128,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers..."
222402,L380127,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,Equipment?
222403,L380116,u6577,m437,JOS YERO,Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
222404,L380115,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"So lay it out, my brother..."
222405,L380035,u6581,m437,TUBBS,They lied.
222406,L380034,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if..."
222407,L380033,u6581,m437,TUBBS,"Alonzo, you don't need to go home."
222408,L380032,u6579,m437,STEVENS,What...?
222409,L380031,u6581,m437,TUBBS,Alonzo...
222410,L380030,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"I gotta, I gotta go...!"
222411,L380026,u6579,m437,STEVENS,"The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types..."
222412,L380025,u6581,m437,TUBBS,What the hell did you do?
222413,L382964,u6583,m438,JOE,"Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some..."
222414,L382963,u6582,m438,CASS,"You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun."
222415,L382961,u6582,m438,CASS,"Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?"
222416,L382960,u6583,m438,JOE,You sure you heard what I said?
222417,L382959,u6582,m438,CASS,"Said, a person's gotta make a living."
222418,L382958,u6583,m438,JOE,"Beg pardon, ma'am?"
222419,L382957,u6582,m438,CASS,Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
222420,L382956,u6583,m438,JOE,"Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler."
222421,L382939,u6582,m438,CASS,"It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost."
222422,L382938,u6583,m438,JOE,The Statue of Liberty.
222423,L382937,u6582,m438,CASS,You're hoping to get a look at what?
222424,L382936,u6583,m438,JOE,"Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty..."
222425,L382866,u6583,m438,JOE,"I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!"
222426,L382865,u6586,m438,RALPH,Ain't gonna collect your pay?
222427,L382864,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, ain't no use hanging around here."
222428,L382863,u6586,m438,RALPH,Must be some mess back there.
222429,L382862,u6583,m438,JOE,"Men, they mostly faggots."
222430,L382861,u6586,m438,RALPH,Yeah?
222431,L382860,u6583,m438,JOE,Lotta rich women back there...
222432,L382859,u6586,m438,RALPH,"What you gonna do back there, East?"
222433,L382857,u6583,m438,JOE,Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
222434,L382856,u6586,m438,RALPH,You ain't coming to work?
222435,L382934,u6588,m438,RICH LADY,"Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"
222436,L382933,u6583,m438,JOE,"No, ma'am, I'm not."
222437,L382932,u6588,m438,RICH LADY,You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
222438,L382931,u6583,m438,JOE,You sure are a pretty lady.
222439,L382930,u6588,m438,RICH LADY,"I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line..."
222440,L382929,u6583,m438,JOE,"Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!"
222441,L382928,u6588,m438,RICH LADY,Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
222442,L383263,u6583,m438,JOE,I show you what problem --
222443,L383262,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
222444,L383261,u6583,m438,JOE,"Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!"
222445,L383260,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,"You gonna beat me, Joe?"
222446,L383259,u6583,m438,JOE,"Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!"
222447,L383257,u6583,m438,JOE,Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
222448,L383256,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,Okay. Never argue with a man.
222449,L383255,u6583,m438,JOE,"M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y."
222450,L383254,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
222451,L383253,u6583,m438,JOE,"Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!"
222452,L383252,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,"If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more."
222453,L383251,u6583,m438,JOE,"What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school."
222454,L383250,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,"That's pretty Freudian, Joe."
222455,L383248,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,I know. Scribbage!
222456,L383247,u6583,m438,JOE,I ain't sleepy.
222457,L383246,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,"Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?"
222458,L383244,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
222459,L383243,u6583,m438,JOE,You think I'm lying!
222460,L383241,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,"Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better."
222461,L383240,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?"
222462,L383236,u6583,m438,JOE,Sure you're all right?
222463,L383235,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,He's got taxi fare.
222464,L383205,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,"What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?"
222465,L383204,u6583,m438,JOE,"Yeah, oh yeah."
222466,L383203,u6589,m438,SHIRLEY,"I can tell, can't you?"
222467,L383361,u6583,m438,JOE,"Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?"
222468,L383360,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Thanks, Joe."
222469,L383359,u6583,m438,JOE,"I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?"
222470,L383358,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Hey, what the hell you doing?"
222471,L383353,u6583,m438,JOE,"You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule."
222472,L383352,u6587,m438,RATSO,"I'm falling apart, that's funny?"
222473,L383351,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself."
222474,L383350,u6583,m438,JOE,"Hell, don't cry about it!"
222475,L383349,u6587,m438,RATSO,I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
222476,L383348,u6583,m438,JOE,You're what?
222477,L383347,u6587,m438,RATSO,I'm wet.
222478,L383346,u6583,m438,JOE,Hey -- whatsa matter?
222479,L383345,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?"
222480,L383344,u6583,m438,JOE,Sounds like they knew you.
222481,L383343,u6587,m438,RATSO,"I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?"
222482,L383342,u6583,m438,JOE,Keep the goddam blanket on.
222483,L383341,u6587,m438,RATSO,I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
222484,L383340,u6583,m438,JOE,"If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?"
222485,L383339,u6583,m438,JOE,Shee-it. You believe all you read?
222486,L383338,u6587,m438,RATSO,I read it.
222487,L383337,u6583,m438,JOE,How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
222488,L383336,u6587,m438,RATSO,You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
222489,L383335,u6583,m438,JOE,Yeah.
222490,L383334,u6587,m438,RATSO,They gotta be.
222491,L383333,u6583,m438,JOE,These guys're good drivers.
222492,L383289,u6587,m438,RATSO,I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
222493,L383288,u6583,m438,JOE,"Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this."
222494,L383287,u6587,m438,RATSO,"I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask."
222495,L383286,u6583,m438,JOE,You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
222496,L383285,u6587,m438,RATSO,"I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance."
222497,L383284,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?"
222498,L383283,u6587,m438,RATSO,"No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor."
222499,L383282,u6583,m438,JOE,"Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what."
222500,L383281,u6587,m438,RATSO,I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
222501,L383280,u6583,m438,JOE,Who?
222502,L383279,u6587,m438,RATSO,"What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!"
222503,L383278,u6583,m438,JOE,What of?
222504,L383277,u6587,m438,RATSO,I'm scared.
222505,L383276,u6583,m438,JOE,And what?
222506,L383275,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh..."
222507,L383274,u6583,m438,JOE,Yeah.
222508,L383273,u6587,m438,RATSO,"But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?"
222509,L383272,u6583,m438,JOE,You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
222510,L383271,u6587,m438,RATSO,"No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks."
222511,L383270,u6583,m438,JOE,They wrong?
222512,L383234,u6587,m438,RATSO,Walk? Naturally I can walk.
222513,L383233,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?"
222514,L383225,u6587,m438,RATSO,Twenty bucks...
222515,L383224,u6583,m438,JOE,"Tell her, Ratso."
222516,L383199,u6587,m438,RATSO,Rico. Rico Rizzo.
222517,L383198,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I..."
222518,L383195,u6583,m438,JOE,"Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess."
222519,L383194,u6587,m438,RATSO,Don't need a comb.
222520,L383193,u6583,m438,JOE,You got a comb?
222521,L383191,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do."
222522,L383190,u6583,m438,JOE,"But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here."
222523,L383189,u6587,m438,RATSO,Don't say nothing about you either.
222524,L383188,u6583,m438,JOE,Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
222525,L383187,u6587,m438,RATSO,"What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party."
222526,L383186,u6583,m438,JOE,Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
222527,L383185,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Yeah, well, so?"
222528,L383184,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas."
222529,L383174,u6587,m438,RATSO,He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
222530,L383173,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'."
222531,L383172,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Can he smell the difference, eh?"
222532,L383171,u6583,m438,JOE,Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
222533,L383170,u6587,m438,RATSO,"The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect."
222534,L383169,u6583,m438,JOE,"Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso."
222535,L383163,u6587,m438,RATSO,"You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me."
222536,L383162,u6583,m438,JOE,Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
222537,L383161,u6587,m438,RATSO,Where'd that come from?
222538,L383160,u6583,m438,JOE,"Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?"
222539,L383159,u6587,m438,RATSO,The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
222540,L383158,u6583,m438,JOE,"Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?"
222541,L383148,u6583,m438,JOE,"What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff."
222542,L383147,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay."
222543,L383146,u6583,m438,JOE,"Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I get myself primed, like I was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around! -- and there you are, you handsome devil."
222544,L383145,u6587,m438,RATSO,You like it? Take a look.
222545,L383144,u6583,m438,JOE,"Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp."
222546,L383141,u6587,m438,RATSO,And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
222547,L383140,u6583,m438,JOE,"Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried."
222548,L383135,u6583,m438,JOE,"Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue."
222549,L383134,u6587,m438,RATSO,"You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?"
222550,L383133,u6583,m438,JOE,You talk like a man with a tin twat.
222551,L383132,u6587,m438,RATSO,"Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap."
222552,L383126,u6583,m438,JOE,What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
222553,L383125,u6587,m438,RATSO,Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.

222913,L383614,u6593,m439,BILLY,What'd the Prosecutor say?
222914,L383592,u6593,m439,BILLY,"If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?"
222915,L383591,u6602,m439,YESIL,You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back.

222940,L384897,u6605,m440,JOSH,"Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him."
222941,L384896,u6608,m440,PETER,Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
222942,L384894,u6608,m440,PETER,Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
222943,L384893,u6605,m440,JOSH,Immigration's gonna love you for that.
222944,L384892,u6608,m440,PETER,"Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure."
222945,L384847,u6605,m440,JOSH,Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
222946,L384846,u6608,m440,PETER,"You really love flashing that thing, don't you?"
222947,L384844,u6608,m440,PETER,"Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell ""Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"""
222948,L384843,u6605,m440,JOSH,"Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren."
222949,L384842,u6608,m440,PETER,Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
222950,L384841,u6605,m440,JOSH,"The blintzes!  ""Try the blintzes..."""
222951,L385149,u6605,m440,JOSH,Right.
222952,L385148,u6606,m440,LEONARD,And a right.
222953,L385147,u6605,m440,JOSH,"I think so. One right, two lefts..."

222957,L385143,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
222958,L385111,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.

222961,L385099,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street..."
222962,L385098,u6605,m440,JOSH,There's really people living down here?
222963,L385097,u6605,m440,JOSH,New York's finest.
222964,L385096,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up."
222965,L385315,u6608,m440,PETER,Go!! Just go!!
222966,L385314,u6606,m440,LEONARD,What do you-?
222967,L385313,u6608,m440,PETER,The kid's with them!!
222968,L385312,u6606,m440,LEONARD,The kid...
222969,L385273,u6608,m440,PETER,Depends.  You got a memo?
222970,L385272,u6606,m440,LEONARD,You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
222971,L385256,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator."
222972,L385255,u6608,m440,PETER,Can we get this car there?
222973,L385231,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
222974,L385230,u6608,m440,PETER,Is there a switch?
222975,L385213,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart..."
222976,L385212,u6608,m440,PETER,"It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead."
222977,L385211,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"""Mistake""?  What's that supposed to...?"
222978,L385210,u6608,m440,PETER,A mistake.
222979,L385208,u6608,m440,PETER,I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
222980,L385207,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?"
222981,L385206,u6608,m440,PETER,"Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here..."
222982,L385205,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out..."
222983,L385204,u6608,m440,PETER,You feel anything?
222984,L385197,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Oh, Jesus!!"
222985,L385196,u6608,m440,PETER,Its muscles are locked.
222986,L385194,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-"
222987,L385193,u6608,m440,PETER,Wait a minute-
222988,L385177,u6608,m440,PETER,Just do it!
222989,L385176,u6606,m440,LEONARD,I only got...
222990,L385160,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"All right, motherfucker, that's it."
222991,L385159,u6608,m440,PETER,"For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?"
222992,L385158,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
222993,L385157,u6608,m440,PETER,What?
222994,L385156,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Oh, man, there you go again."
222995,L385155,u6608,m440,PETER,You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
222996,L385154,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead."
222997,L385153,u6608,m440,PETER,Any luck?
222998,L385142,u6608,m440,PETER,You got a better way up?
222999,L385141,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Oh, that's gonna work."
223000,L385136,u6608,m440,PETER,Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
223001,L385135,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Did you see the size of that thing?!
223002,L385108,u6608,m440,PETER,20 minutes.  Susan?
223003,L385107,u6606,m440,LEONARD,20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
223004,L385106,u6608,m440,PETER,We'll be back at the platform in...
223005,L385005,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude."
223006,L385004,u6608,m440,PETER,"For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?"
223007,L385001,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"No, you talkin' at me."
223008,L385000,u6608,m440,PETER,"Excuse me, I'm talking to you."
223009,L384993,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
223010,L384992,u6608,m440,PETER,Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
223011,L384991,u6606,m440,LEONARD,...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
223012,L384990,u6608,m440,PETER,The Department of Public Health...
223013,L384989,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks..."
223014,L384988,u6608,m440,PETER,"Look, I showed you my badge..."
223015,L385297,u6607,m440,MANNY,"Nino, please..."
223016,L385296,u6606,m440,LEONARD,What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
223017,L385271,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You..."
223018,L385270,u6607,m440,MANNY,I pull.
223019,L385269,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"The lights come up, you pull the switch."
223020,L385191,u6607,m440,MANNY,"Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!"
223021,L385190,u6606,m440,LEONARD,You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
223022,L385170,u6607,m440,MANNY,"Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her."
223023,L385169,u6606,m440,LEONARD,What are you doing down here?
223024,L385164,u6607,m440,MANNY,"Hurry, the woman needs help!"
223025,L385163,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"My God, what the hell are you...?"
223026,L384999,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"He can imitate anything, you just watch him."
223027,L384998,u6607,m440,MANNY,He's special.
223028,L385327,u6606,m440,LEONARD,No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
223029,L385326,u6611,m440,SUSAN,We're no leaving you!
223030,L385323,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Across both tracks!!
223031,L385322,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Which way?
223032,L385318,u6606,m440,LEONARD,Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
223033,L385317,u6611,m440,SUSAN,What?
223034,L385316,u6606,m440,LEONARD,He didn't do it!
223035,L385262,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!"
223036,L385261,u6606,m440,LEONARD,It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
223037,L385258,u6606,m440,LEONARD,"Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables..."
223038,L385257,u6611,m440,SUSAN,But the power...
223039,L385252,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
223040,L385251,u6606,m440,LEONARD,What are you putting that crap on me for?
223041,L385278,u6611,m440,SUSAN,We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
223042,L385277,u6607,m440,MANNY,"I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy..."
223043,L385276,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Manny...
223044,L385275,u6607,m440,MANNY,He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
223045,L385226,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?"
223046,L385225,u6607,m440,MANNY,"""...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."""
223047,L385224,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
223048,L385217,u6611,m440,SUSAN,No...
223049,L385216,u6607,m440,MANNY,But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
223050,L385215,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Just inner chambers...
223051,L385352,u6608,m440,PETER,We can do it!
223052,L385351,u6611,m440,SUSAN,No...
223053,L385345,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Peter...
223054,L385344,u6608,m440,PETER,Talk to me.
223055,L385343,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Ah...
223056,L385342,u6608,m440,PETER,C'mon...
223057,L385339,u6608,m440,PETER,I can.  We can do this...
223058,L385338,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Your arm, you can't..."
223059,L385337,u6608,m440,PETER,You go first. I'll be right below you.
223060,L385336,u6608,m440,PETER,Jump in.
223061,L385335,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Oh, come on, come on!"
223062,L385286,u6611,m440,SUSAN,That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
223063,L385285,u6608,m440,PETER,I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
223064,L385281,u6608,m440,PETER,Try not to sweat?
223065,L385280,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes..."
223066,L385267,u6608,m440,PETER,That's why we should do it now.
223067,L385266,u6611,m440,SUSAN,The scent won't last...
223068,L385265,u6608,m440,PETER,It worked before...
223069,L385264,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Peter-
223070,L385263,u6608,m440,PETER,We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
223071,L385250,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Just do it!!
223072,L385249,u6608,m440,PETER,What-
223073,L385248,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Rub it on the windows!
223074,L385243,u6608,m440,PETER,Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
223075,L385242,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!"
223076,L385241,u6608,m440,PETER,It's no use! They know we're in here!
223077,L385240,u6608,m440,PETER,How?!
223078,L385239,u6611,m440,SUSAN,His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
223079,L385220,u6611,m440,SUSAN,That's camouflage...
223080,L385219,u6608,m440,PETER,"So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or..."
223081,L385175,u6608,m440,PETER,Toss the flare down!
223082,L385174,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"No, Jesus, no."
223083,L385167,u6608,m440,PETER,Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
223084,L385166,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Don't.
223085,L385103,u6608,m440,PETER,"Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing..."
223086,L385102,u6611,m440,SUSAN,It's me. Can you hear me?
223087,L385059,u6608,m440,PETER,I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
223088,L385058,u6611,m440,SUSAN,It didn't bite me.
223089,L385057,u6608,m440,PETER,"Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri..."
223090,L385056,u6608,m440,PETER,No.
223091,L385055,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
223092,L385054,u6608,m440,PETER,You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
223093,L385053,u6611,m440,SUSAN,...you don't even know what you're looking for.
223094,L385040,u6608,m440,PETER,"Susan, we're not b-"
223095,L385039,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are..."
223096,L385038,u6611,m440,SUSAN,I was just late.
223097,L385037,u6608,m440,PETER,"Oh, no, you were-"
223098,L385034,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Right.
223099,L385033,u6608,m440,PETER,Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
223100,L385032,u6611,m440,SUSAN,I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
223101,L385031,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"No such thing, baby."
223102,L385030,u6608,m440,PETER,Great crowd.
223103,L385010,u6608,m440,PETER,"Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!"
223104,L385009,u6611,m440,SUSAN,He was just doing his job.
223105,L385008,u6608,m440,PETER,"Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?"
223106,L385007,u6611,m440,SUSAN,I heard how you talked to him.
223107,L385006,u6608,m440,PETER,You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
223108,L384985,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"No, there's..."
223109,L384984,u6608,m440,PETER,"Honey, just leave it."
223110,L384965,u6608,m440,PETER,So?
223111,L384964,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Metaxonycha Godmani.
223112,L384960,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?"
223113,L384959,u6608,m440,PETER,Maybe they lied to you.
223114,L384958,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
223115,L384953,u6608,m440,PETER,We?
223116,L384952,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
223117,L384950,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Don't you get it? It's more than that.
223118,L384949,u6608,m440,PETER,Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
223119,L384948,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!"
223120,L384947,u6611,m440,SUSAN,I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
223121,L384946,u6608,m440,PETER,Thought it was my week for that.
223122,L384837,u6611,m440,SUSAN,I'll be late.
223123,L384836,u6608,m440,PETER,"Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight."
223124,L384835,u6608,m440,PETER,Don't get kinky here...
223125,L384834,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that."
223126,L384831,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
223127,L384830,u6608,m440,PETER,You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
223128,L384816,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"We're down to a ""couple"" now, huh?"
223129,L384815,u6608,m440,PETER,"Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours."
223130,L384809,u6608,m440,PETER,Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
223131,L384808,u6611,m440,SUSAN,We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
223132,L384807,u6611,m440,SUSAN,You know what I mean...
223133,L384806,u6608,m440,PETER,Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
223134,L384805,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Do you think we did the right thing?
223135,L384804,u6608,m440,PETER,You did!
223136,L384803,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Please.
223137,L384802,u6608,m440,PETER,A shame.  You looked great tonight.
223138,L384973,u6609,m440,RICKY,"No way. I see one of those, I'd puke."
223139,L384972,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"An ""Ootheca"". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh ""weirdbugs"" inside."
223140,L384971,u6609,m440,RICKY,Gross. What is it?
223141,L384970,u6611,m440,SUSAN,You sure you didn't see one of these?
223142,L384879,u6609,m440,RICKY,That's it?
223143,L384878,u6611,m440,SUSAN,You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
223144,L384870,u6609,m440,RICKY,"You the bug lady, right?"
223145,L384869,u6611,m440,SUSAN,Hello.
223146,L384920,u6611,m440,SUSAN,I know.  Help me get a sample.
223147,L384919,u6610,m440,SIRI,That's impossible.  Insects don't...
223148,L384917,u6610,m440,SIRI,What?
223149,L384916,u6611,m440,SUSAN,My God.
223150,L384915,u6611,m440,SUSAN,And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
223151,L384914,u6610,m440,SIRI,Fuck! It broke the skin...
223152,L384913,u6611,m440,SUSAN,This wing configuration. I've never...
223153,L384912,u6610,m440,SIRI,No shit.
223154,L384911,u6611,m440,SUSAN,It bit you.
223155,L384908,u6611,m440,SUSAN,I have no idea.  Are you ready?
223156,L384907,u6610,m440,SIRI,What is it?
223157,L384906,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?"
223158,L384868,u6610,m440,SIRI,"Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy."
223159,L384867,u6611,m440,SUSAN,What's this?
223160,L384864,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Oh, Jesus."
223161,L384863,u6610,m440,SIRI,"Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster."
223162,L384862,u6610,m440,SIRI,She used a baster.
223163,L384861,u6611,m440,SUSAN,What?
223164,L384860,u6610,m440,SIRI,"I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah..."
223165,L384859,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here."
223166,L384858,u6610,m440,SIRI,"I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter."
223167,L384857,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that."
223168,L384839,u6610,m440,SIRI,"Just like Trump Tower, then."
223169,L384838,u6611,m440,SUSAN,"Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions..."
223170,L387784,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
223171,L387783,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime."
223172,L387781,u6612,m441,ANNIE,But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
223173,L387780,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going."
223174,L387778,u6613,m441,BUSTER,You got a point there...
223175,L387777,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else."
223176,L387776,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself."
223177,L387774,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Sounds good.
223178,L387773,u6612,m441,ANNIE,How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
223179,L387772,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Sure.
223180,L387771,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?"
223181,L387770,u6613,m441,BUSTER,I'm not much of a critic.
223182,L387769,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think."
223183,L387768,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
223184,L387766,u6612,m441,ANNIE,It's right this way.
223185,L387765,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Sure.
223186,L387764,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?"
223187,L387758,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Thank you.
223188,L387757,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please."
223189,L387756,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and..."
223190,L387754,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Anything you can tell me might help.
223191,L387753,u6612,m441,ANNIE,What do you want to know?
223192,L387752,u6613,m441,BUSTER,I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
223193,L387751,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?"
223194,L387750,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock."
223195,L387749,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, my!"
223196,L387820,u6615,m441,PAUL,You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
223197,L387819,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Did I do good?
223198,L387818,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Ahh!!!
223199,L387817,u6615,m441,PAUL,You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
223200,L387816,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?"
223201,L387815,u6615,m441,PAUL,I'm almost done.
223202,L387814,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Yes, Paul."
223203,L387812,u6615,m441,PAUL,Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
223204,L387811,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non."
223205,L387810,u6615,m441,PAUL,You don't know?
223206,L387809,u6612,m441,ANNIE,What things?
223207,L387808,u6615,m441,PAUL,"You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things."
223208,L387807,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me."
223209,L387806,u6615,m441,PAUL,It will.
223210,L387805,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, this will be our legacy."
223211,L387804,u6615,m441,PAUL,I'm glad you like it.
223212,L387803,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful."
223213,L387801,u6615,m441,PAUL,Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
223214,L387800,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?"
223215,L387799,u6615,m441,PAUL,Maybe.
223216,L387798,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?"
223217,L387797,u6615,m441,PAUL,Three more chapters to go.
223218,L387796,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, Paul. It's beautiful."
223219,L387794,u6615,m441,PAUL,It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
223220,L387793,u6612,m441,ANNIE,But the time is now. Soon others will come.
223221,L387792,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book."
223222,L387747,u6612,m441,ANNIE,That's disgusting.
223223,L387746,u6615,m441,PAUL,Be my guest.
223224,L387745,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
223225,L387744,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles..."
223226,L387743,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?"
223227,L387742,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot."
223228,L387741,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Don't talk to me like that.
223229,L387740,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here."
223230,L387739,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week."
223231,L387708,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?"
223232,L387707,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Now don't fuss, Paul."
223233,L387703,u6615,m441,PAUL,I don't know what you're talking about.
223234,L387702,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south."
223235,L387701,u6615,m441,PAUL,"No, I haven't."
223236,L387700,u6612,m441,ANNIE,You've been out of your room.
223237,L387699,u6615,m441,PAUL,What?
223238,L387698,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, I know you've been out."
223239,L387689,u6615,m441,PAUL,It is.
223240,L387688,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true."
223241,L387687,u6615,m441,PAUL,Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
223242,L387686,u6612,m441,ANNIE,The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
223243,L387685,u6615,m441,PAUL,Why would you lose me?
223244,L387684,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me."
223245,L387683,u6612,m441,ANNIE,The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
223246,L387682,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Annie, what is it?"
223247,L387679,u6615,m441,PAUL,I think you're right.
223248,L387678,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written."
223249,L387677,u6615,m441,PAUL,To Misery.
223250,L387676,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?"
223251,L387673,u6615,m441,PAUL,It's perfect.
223252,L387672,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?"
223253,L387671,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice."
223254,L387670,u6612,m441,ANNIE,You really think so?
223255,L387669,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Well, it certainly says you."
223256,L387668,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years."
223257,L387667,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?"
223258,L387666,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look."
223259,L387665,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?"
223260,L387664,u6612,m441,ANNIE,To Misery.
223261,L387663,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine."
223262,L387662,u6612,m441,ANNIE,A toast?
223263,L387661,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Annie, I think we should have a toast."
223264,L387660,u6615,m441,PAUL,Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
223265,L387659,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef."
223266,L387658,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?"
223267,L387657,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Oh...
223268,L387656,u6615,m441,PAUL,It looks wonderful. And so do you.
223269,L387655,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I hope you like it.
223270,L387646,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, Paul. It would be an honor."
223271,L387645,u6615,m441,PAUL,To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
223272,L387641,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I'm going to play my records all day
223273,L387640,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?"
223274,L387639,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?"
223275,L387638,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Not even a hint?
223276,L387637,u6615,m441,PAUL,Have to wait.
223277,L387636,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
223278,L387635,u6615,m441,PAUL,...have to wait.
223279,L387634,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the ""n""s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?"
223280,L387633,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Yeah, yeah..."
223281,L387632,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
223282,L387630,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--"
223283,L387629,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?"
223284,L387628,u6615,m441,PAUL,Nothing.
223285,L387627,u6612,m441,ANNIE,What?
223286,L387626,u6615,m441,PAUL,What about a bee...?
223287,L387625,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, ""I 'gotta' know will she live,"" ""I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer."" ""I gotta see how this chapter ends."" You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you."
223288,L387624,u6615,m441,PAUL,I said that?
223289,L387623,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"The ""gotta."" Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the ""gotta."""
223290,L387622,u6615,m441,PAUL,The what?
223291,L387621,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"You can--you have the ""gotta""--"
223292,L387620,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I'm telling you, I can't."
223293,L387619,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Don't be silly. Of course you can.
223294,L387618,u6615,m441,PAUL,I can't write this anymore.
223295,L387617,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word."
223296,L387615,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any ""experimental blood transfusion"" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there."
223297,L387614,u6615,m441,PAUL,They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
223298,L387613,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"""HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"""
223299,L387612,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, ""This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"""
223300,L387611,u6615,m441,PAUL,--cliff-hangers--
223301,L387610,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays..."
223302,L387609,u6615,m441,PAUL,--not fair?
223303,L387608,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, what you've written just isn't fair."
223304,L387607,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here."
223305,L387606,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in."
223306,L387605,u6615,m441,PAUL,"What? What happened to ""I'll treasure whatever you do?"""
223307,L387604,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again."
223308,L387594,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
223309,L387593,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much."
223310,L387592,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Here, in case you think of any ideas."
223311,L387586,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please..."
223312,L387585,u6612,m441,ANNIE,It'll only take a second.
223313,L387584,u6615,m441,PAUL,I want my pills NOW!
223314,L387583,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
223315,L387582,u6615,m441,PAUL,You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
223316,L387581,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?"
223317,L387572,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? ""You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie."" Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man."
223318,L387571,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Annie, what's the matter?"
223319,L387570,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you."
223320,L387569,u6615,m441,PAUL,"No, just the paper will be fine."
223321,L387568,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
223322,L387567,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written."
223323,L387566,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?"
223324,L387565,u6615,m441,PAUL,"C'mere, I'll show you."
223325,L387564,u6612,m441,ANNIE,But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
223326,L387563,u6615,m441,PAUL,"You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo."
223327,L387562,u6612,m441,ANNIE,You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
223328,L387561,u6615,m441,PAUL,"It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie."
223329,L387560,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an ""n."" I told the saleslady ""n"" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name."
223330,L387558,u6615,m441,PAUL,Great.
223331,L387557,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
223332,L387556,u6615,m441,PAUL,I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
223333,L387553,u6615,m441,PAUL,"You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation."
223334,L387552,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
223335,L387551,u6615,m441,PAUL,"You just expect me to whip something off, that it?"
223336,L387550,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world..."
223337,L387549,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right."
223338,L387548,u6615,m441,PAUL,Misery's Return?
223339,L387547,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return."
223340,L387546,u6615,m441,PAUL,Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
223341,L387545,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work."
223342,L387544,u6615,m441,PAUL,Set what up?
223343,L387543,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up."
223344,L387542,u6615,m441,PAUL,"If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books."
223345,L387541,u6612,m441,ANNIE,And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
223346,L387540,u6615,m441,PAUL,Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
223347,L387539,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"See, isn't this nice?"
223348,L387538,u6615,m441,PAUL,Great.
223349,L387537,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?"
223350,L387536,u6615,m441,PAUL,I don't know.
223351,L387535,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
223352,L387525,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul."
223353,L387524,u6615,m441,PAUL,You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
223354,L387523,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values."
223355,L387522,u6615,m441,PAUL,"You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it."
223356,L387521,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago."
223357,L387520,u6612,m441,ANNIE,So you've indicated. Do it.
223358,L387519,u6615,m441,PAUL,No big deal.
223359,L387518,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Then light the match, Paul."
223360,L387517,u6615,m441,PAUL,"This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything."
223361,L387516,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best."
223362,L387515,u6615,m441,PAUL,You want me to burn my book?
223363,L387514,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Yes.
223364,L387513,u6615,m441,PAUL,You want me to burn my book?
223365,L387510,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Yes.
223366,L387509,u6615,m441,PAUL,Show me the way?
223367,L387508,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said ""I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."""
223368,L387507,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver."
223369,L387506,u6615,m441,PAUL,I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
223370,L387505,u6612,m441,ANNIE,You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
223371,L387504,u6615,m441,PAUL,Perfect.
223372,L387503,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?"
223373,L387498,u6612,m441,ANNIE,She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
223374,L387497,u6615,m441,PAUL,"No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all."
223375,L387496,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Then who did?
223376,L387495,u6615,m441,PAUL,I DIDN'T...
223377,L387494,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
223378,L387493,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--"
223379,L387492,u6612,m441,ANNIE,You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
223380,L387491,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me."
223381,L387490,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Well, I hope you like it."
223382,L387489,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens."
223383,L387488,u6612,m441,ANNIE,It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
223384,L387487,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly."
223385,L387486,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
223386,L387485,u6612,m441,ANNIE,No problem.
223387,L387484,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Yeah, thanks."
223388,L387483,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Done?
223389,L387482,u6615,m441,PAUL,I'm...
223390,L387481,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
223391,L387479,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too."
223392,L387478,u6615,m441,PAUL,I know how that can be.
223393,L387477,u6612,m441,ANNIE,For a while I thought I might go crazy.
223394,L387474,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world..."
223395,L387473,u6615,m441,PAUL,The Sistine Chapel?
223396,L387472,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?"
223397,L387471,u6615,m441,PAUL,She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
223398,L387470,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so."
223399,L387469,u6615,m441,PAUL,I'm getting to believe you.
223400,L387468,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
223401,L387467,u6615,m441,PAUL,Misery?
223402,L387466,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery."
223403,L387465,u6615,m441,PAUL,My pleasure.
223404,L387464,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Thank you so much.
223405,L387463,u6615,m441,PAUL,You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
223406,L387462,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?"
223407,L387461,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines."
223408,L387460,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that."
223409,L387457,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I can live with ""great."""
223410,L387456,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would ""great"" be insulting?"
223411,L387455,u6615,m441,PAUL,I guess that means it's okay.
223412,L387454,u6612,m441,ANNIE,I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
223413,L387452,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
223414,L387451,u6615,m441,PAUL,I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
223415,L387450,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend."
223416,L387449,u6615,m441,PAUL,My daughter must be going nuts.
223417,L387448,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain..."
223418,L387447,u6615,m441,PAUL,The phones are working?
223419,L387446,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you."
223420,L387445,u6615,m441,PAUL,Then the roads are open...
223421,L387444,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy."
223422,L387443,u6615,m441,PAUL,It's fine.
223423,L387442,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you."
223424,L387424,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that."
223425,L387423,u6612,m441,ANNIE,It has no nobility.
223426,L387422,u6615,m441,PAUL,The profanity bothers you?
223427,L387421,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it."
223428,L387420,u6615,m441,PAUL,Pretty rough so far.
223429,L387419,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant."
223430,L387418,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I can take it, go ahead."
223431,L387417,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?"
223432,L387416,u6615,m441,PAUL,"No, what is it?"
223433,L387415,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Nothing.
223434,L387414,u6615,m441,PAUL,But what?
223435,L387404,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Oh, like I could do that?"
223436,L387403,u6615,m441,PAUL,"It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but ""Misery"" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title."
223437,L387402,u6612,m441,ANNIE,What's it about?
223438,L387401,u6615,m441,PAUL,I don't have a title yet.
223439,L387400,u6612,m441,ANNIE,What's your new book called?
223440,L387398,u6612,m441,ANNIE,You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
223441,L387397,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck."
223442,L387396,u6612,m441,ANNIE,If you wouldn't mind.
223443,L387395,u6615,m441,PAUL,You want to read it?
223444,L387394,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe..."
223445,L387393,u6615,m441,PAUL,"When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing."
223446,L387392,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done."
223447,L387391,u6615,m441,PAUL,You're very kind...
223448,L387389,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels..."
223449,L387388,u6615,m441,PAUL,I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
223450,L387387,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming."
223451,L387386,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--"
223452,L387385,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer."
223453,L387384,u6615,m441,PAUL,Following me?
223454,L387383,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you."
223455,L387355,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better."
223456,L387354,u6615,m441,PAUL,Will I be able to walk?
223457,L387353,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you."
223458,L387350,u6612,m441,ANNIE,"The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down."
223459,L387349,u6615,m441,PAUL,Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
223460,L387348,u6612,m441,ANNIE,They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
223461,L387347,u6615,m441,PAUL,What are they...?
223462,L387346,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Here.
223463,L387344,u6615,m441,PAUL,--my number one fan.
223464,L387343,u6612,m441,ANNIE,You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
223465,L387342,u6615,m441,PAUL,How long...?
223466,L387341,u6612,m441,ANNIE,Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
223467,L387722,u6613,m441,BUSTER,There's that spice again.
223468,L387721,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,It's good you found it.
223469,L387720,u6613,m441,BUSTER,I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
223470,L387719,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,What is it?
223471,L387718,u6613,m441,BUSTER,That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
223472,L387717,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,What thing?
223473,L387716,u6613,m441,BUSTER,How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
223474,L387715,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,"Oh, I like that tone."
223475,L387714,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Just leave it, all right?"
223476,L387696,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"""There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."""
223477,L387695,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,That's nice.
223478,L387694,u6613,m441,BUSTER,They're hauling Misery into court.
223479,L387693,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,What?
223480,L387692,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"""There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."""
223481,L387654,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice."
223482,L387653,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
223483,L387652,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about."
223484,L387651,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,"Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot."
223485,L387650,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye."
223486,L387602,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents."
223487,L387601,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
223488,L387600,u6613,m441,BUSTER,He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
223489,L387599,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,"You don't think he's dead, do you?"
223490,L387502,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Just from his agent.
223491,L387501,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
223492,L387441,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office."
223493,L387440,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,You really think Sheldon's out there?
223494,L387437,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
223495,L387436,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,Could be the weight of the snow.
223496,L387434,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,What? What is it?
223497,L387433,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Stop--stop right here.
223498,L387432,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,"Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff."
223499,L387431,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy."
223500,L387380,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,Four or five days ago. Why?
223501,L387379,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?"
223502,L387378,u6618,m441,VIRGINIA,We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
223503,L387377,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"G'bye, Ms. Sindell."
223504,L387376,u6617,m441,SINDELL,I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
223505,L387374,u6617,m441,SINDELL,I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
223506,L387373,u6613,m441,BUSTER,You think he might be missing?
223507,L387372,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him..."
223508,L387371,u6613,m441,BUSTER,I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
223509,L387370,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?"
223510,L387369,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks."
223511,L387368,u6617,m441,SINDELL,I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
223512,L387367,u6613,m441,BUSTER,People sure like those Misery books.
223513,L387366,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"Yes, he is."
223514,L387365,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"He's your client, huh?"
223515,L387364,u6617,m441,SINDELL,Yes.
223516,L387363,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
223517,L387362,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble."
223518,L387412,u6613,m441,BUSTER,I'm sure you're right.
223519,L387411,u6614,m441,LIBBY,I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
223520,L387410,u6613,m441,BUSTER,So do I...
223521,L387409,u6614,m441,LIBBY,"I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him."
223522,L387408,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?"
223523,L387407,u6614,m441,LIBBY,"No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door."
223524,L387406,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Maybe you can, Libby."
223525,L387405,u6614,m441,LIBBY,"Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne."
223526,L387738,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
223527,L387737,u6616,m441,PETE,"No, the typing kind."
223528,L387736,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Newspapers?
223529,L387735,u6616,m441,PETE,Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
223530,L387734,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Has she been buying any odd things lately?
223531,L387733,u6616,m441,PETE,"Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy."
223532,L387732,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?"
223533,L387731,u6616,m441,PETE,We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
223534,L387730,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
223535,L387729,u6616,m441,PETE,If I can.
223536,L387728,u6613,m441,BUSTER,Answer me a couple things?
223537,L387727,u6616,m441,PETE,Buster.
223538,L387726,u6613,m441,BUSTER,"Hey, Pete."
223539,L387850,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I am. Well, maybe not completely--"
223540,L387849,u6617,m441,SINDELL,I thought you were over it.
223541,L387848,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"Now you've hurt me, Paul."
223542,L387847,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks."
223543,L387846,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house."
223544,L387845,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me."
223545,L387844,u6615,m441,PAUL,"I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book."
223546,L387843,u6617,m441,SINDELL,I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
223547,L387842,u6615,m441,PAUL,Great.
223548,L387841,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes."
223549,L387840,u6615,m441,PAUL,That'd be a first.
223550,L387839,u6617,m441,SINDELL,The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
223551,L387838,u6617,m441,SINDELL,Here it is.  Very first copy.
223552,L387837,u6615,m441,PAUL,Yeah. They're in the semis.
223553,L387836,u6617,m441,SINDELL,Did they win?
223554,L387835,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd..."
223555,L387338,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone."
223556,L387337,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, ""Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study."
223557,L387336,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Marcia, you know I started ""Misery"" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here."
223558,L387335,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her."
223559,L387334,u6615,m441,PAUL,"Marcia, please."
223560,L387333,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million."
223561,L387332,u6615,m441,PAUL,I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
223562,L387331,u6617,m441,SINDELL,You're still a writer.
223563,L387330,u6615,m441,PAUL,"When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then."
223564,L387329,u6617,m441,SINDELL,"It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character."
223565,L387328,u6615,m441,PAUL,An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
223566,L388530,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Hugh, I'm impressed.."
223567,L388529,u6627,m442,STAMP,Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
223568,L388285,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
223569,L388284,u6627,m442,STAMP,Where is it?
223570,L388283,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card."
223571,L388282,u6627,m442,STAMP,I thought you were going to dinner.
223572,L388174,u6627,m442,STAMP,"Sean, please.."
223573,L388173,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?"
223574,L388170,u6627,m442,STAMP,"Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate."
223575,L388169,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive."
223576,L388168,u6627,m442,STAMP,"Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?"
223577,L388167,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,From her point of view or mine?
223578,L388166,u6627,m442,STAMP,Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
223579,L387881,u6627,m442,STAMP,Not possible..
223580,L387880,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
223581,L387879,u6627,m442,STAMP,"All done, chief.."
223582,L387878,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence.."
223583,L388469,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
223584,L388468,u6626,m442,NYAH,What are you talking about?
223585,L388467,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money."
223586,L388466,u6626,m442,NYAH,If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
223587,L388465,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?"
223588,L388464,u6626,m442,NYAH,Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
223589,L388463,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Feel like pleading for your life?
223590,L388281,u6626,m442,NYAH,Lovely.
223591,L388280,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
223592,L388279,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit."
223593,L388278,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
223594,L388277,u6626,m442,NYAH,A change of plans?
223595,L388276,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
223596,L388275,u6626,m442,NYAH,Sort it all out.
223597,L388274,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,To do what?
223598,L388273,u6626,m442,NYAH,"I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time."
223599,L388272,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Then don't say it.
223600,L388271,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say."
223601,L388264,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Well, that's good, isn't?"
223602,L388263,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,You picked another winner!
223603,L388228,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,What else?
223604,L388227,u6626,m442,NYAH,To win?
223605,L388220,u6626,m442,NYAH,Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
223606,L388219,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,See anything you like?
223607,L388182,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
223608,L388181,u6626,m442,NYAH,'Thief in the Night?'
223609,L388180,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
223610,L388179,u6626,m442,NYAH,I suppose I did.
223611,L388178,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,You won.
223612,L388158,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards..."
223613,L388157,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here."
223614,L388156,u6626,m442,NYAH,Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
223615,L388155,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"I said you're beautiful, Nyah."
223616,L388147,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Oh, I am.  Later.."
223617,L388146,u6626,m442,NYAH,You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
223618,L388143,u6626,m442,NYAH,And my room?
223619,L388142,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Mmmm.
223620,L388141,u6626,m442,NYAH,Your room.
223621,L388125,u6626,m442,NYAH,Ahh..
223622,L388124,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Magic...
223623,L388123,u6626,m442,NYAH,How do you that.
223624,L388122,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"How I usually find you, Nyah."
223625,L388121,u6626,m442,NYAH,How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
223626,L388120,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,On what.
223627,L388119,u6626,m442,NYAH,Well that depends.
223628,L388118,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,How grateful?
223629,L388117,u6626,m442,NYAH,"I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean."
223630,L388116,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Not much luggage.
223631,L388510,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy."
223632,L388509,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
223633,L388505,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,In downtown Sydney for a start.
223634,L388504,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,Where?
223635,L388503,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
223636,L388502,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,What are you talking about?
223637,L388501,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
223638,L388500,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
223639,L388433,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"In other words, you're calling her a flake."
223640,L388432,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions.."
223641,L388429,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer."
223642,L388428,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go."
223643,L388427,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl."
223644,L388426,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
223645,L388425,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Why, you going to make me a better offer?"
223646,L388424,u6622,m442,ETHAN,What was the top bid?
223647,L388423,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
223648,L388422,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"There it is, guys, the last of it."
223649,L388420,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for."
223650,L388419,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,I knew where it was.
223651,L388418,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was."
223652,L388417,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes."
223653,L388416,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you."
223654,L388415,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,And you're happy about that?
223655,L388414,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Fight a bit of a cold..
223656,L388351,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
223657,L388350,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security."
223658,L388222,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed."
223659,L388221,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Nyah!
223660,L388508,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty."
223661,L388507,u6629,m442,WALLIS,Ninety-three point four million.
223662,L388506,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,"-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are.."
223663,L388490,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,In any case we don't want your cash.
223664,L388489,u6629,m442,WALLIS,More like two-two point two million.
223665,L388488,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,Not exactly.  Wallis?
223666,L387883,u6619,m442,AMBROSE,It's that time.  Go.
223667,L387882,u6629,m442,WALLIS,"Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots.."
223668,L388477,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts."
223669,L388476,u6620,m442,BILLY,What are you talking about?
223670,L388475,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
223671,L388201,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO."
223672,L388200,u6620,m442,BILLY,"Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something."
223673,L388137,u6620,m442,BILLY,"Oh well, if that's how you feel about it."
223674,L388136,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
223675,L388135,u6620,m442,BILLY,Well do you disagree with that?
223676,L388133,u6620,m442,BILLY,"- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say."
223677,L388132,u6622,m442,ETHAN,..or hard wired..
223678,L388131,u6620,m442,BILLY,"Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating.."
223679,L388130,u6622,m442,ETHAN,A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
223680,L388129,u6620,m442,BILLY,"What you got there, mate?"
223681,L388109,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position."
223682,L388108,u6620,m442,BILLY,Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
223683,L388585,u6620,m442,BILLY,"Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man."
223684,L388584,u6623,m442,LUTHER,And the check's in the mall.
223685,L388583,u6620,m442,BILLY,That's it?  That's it? That's it?
223686,L388554,u6623,m442,LUTHER,We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
223687,L388553,u6620,m442,BILLY,There she is.  I got visual.
223688,L388552,u6620,m442,BILLY,I hope there's a place to land.
223689,L388551,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Range is two kay.
223690,L388523,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Not for seven more minutes.
223691,L388522,u6620,m442,BILLY,We're due to take off.
223692,L388474,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Right.
223693,L388473,u6620,m442,BILLY,Before we kill her or cure her..
223694,L388381,u6623,m442,LUTHER,..in the building...
223695,L388380,u6620,m442,BILLY,Exactly where is she?
223696,L388379,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?"
223697,L388360,u6623,m442,LUTHER,I'm not ready!
223698,L388359,u6620,m442,BILLY,Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
223699,L388328,u6620,m442,BILLY,There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
223700,L388327,u6623,m442,LUTHER,So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
223701,L388288,u6623,m442,LUTHER,What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
223702,L388287,u6620,m442,BILLY,Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
223703,L388114,u6620,m442,BILLY,Then we got'em!
223704,L388113,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"It is, Billy."
223705,L388405,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
223706,L388404,u6621,m442,BILLY'S VOICE,What can we do' mate?
223707,L388403,u6623,m442,LUTHER,He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
223708,L388402,u6621,m442,BILLY'S VOICE,"How're we doin', then?"
223709,L388395,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
223710,L388394,u6621,m442,BILLY'S VOICE,How much longer before you can reach him?
223711,L388393,u6623,m442,LUTHER,She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
223712,L388383,u6623,m442,LUTHER,I am. She is.
223713,L388382,u6621,m442,BILLY'S VOICE,Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
223714,L388247,u6621,m442,BILLY'S VOICE,"He's heading down the stairs, now.."
223715,L388246,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan."
223716,L388590,u6622,m442,ETHAN,No...
223717,L388589,u6626,m442,NYAH,No.  You just looked as if you did.
223718,L388588,u6622,m442,ETHAN,No.  Should I?
223719,L388445,u6626,m442,NYAH,I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
223720,L388444,u6622,m442,ETHAN,No.
223721,L388443,u6626,m442,NYAH,Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
223722,L388442,u6622,m442,ETHAN,No.
223723,L388441,u6626,m442,NYAH,"I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?"
223724,L388440,u6622,m442,ETHAN,- you who don't have a conscience.
223725,L388439,u6626,m442,NYAH,"I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all."
223726,L388438,u6622,m442,ETHAN,What did you think you were doing!
223727,L388326,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!"
223728,L388325,u6626,m442,NYAH,What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
223729,L388324,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose.."
223730,L388323,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?"
223731,L388308,u6622,m442,ETHAN,It's going to be okay.
223732,L388307,u6626,m442,NYAH,I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
223733,L388306,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Are you okay?
223734,L388305,u6626,m442,NYAH,Oh Ethan!..
223735,L388304,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Easy, easy, easy, shhh!"
223736,L388259,u6622,m442,ETHAN,He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
223737,L388258,u6626,m442,NYAH,How do you suggest I go about it?
223738,L388257,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
223739,L388255,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Ethan, tell me -"
223740,L388254,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit."
223741,L388252,u6626,m442,NYAH,Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
223742,L388251,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I want <i>you out of there.</i>
223743,L388239,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
223744,L388238,u6626,m442,NYAH,I managed.
223745,L388218,u6626,m442,NYAH,I'll muddle through.
223746,L388217,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?"
223747,L388216,u6626,m442,NYAH,Where do I meet you?
223748,L388215,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Affirmative.
223749,L388214,u6626,m442,NYAH,-- his left jacket pocket.
223750,L388205,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
223751,L388204,u6626,m442,NYAH,Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
223752,L388199,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I've no doubt.
223753,L388198,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door."
223754,L388197,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Have you met them?
223755,L388196,u6626,m442,NYAH,"- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house."
223756,L388195,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on.."
223757,L388192,u6626,m442,NYAH,Just about..
223758,L388191,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Just like old times?
223759,L388190,u6626,m442,NYAH,Just like old times.
223760,L388189,u6622,m442,ETHAN,How's it going?  Everything okay?
223761,L388099,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you.."
223762,L388098,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice."
223763,L388097,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
223764,L388096,u6626,m442,NYAH,Yes?
223765,L388095,u6622,m442,ETHAN,He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
223766,L388094,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character."
223767,L388093,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You don't trust me.
223768,L388092,u6626,m442,NYAH,How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
223769,L388091,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Before you are.
223770,L388083,u6626,m442,NYAH,Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
223771,L388082,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street.."
223772,L388081,u6626,m442,NYAH,This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
223773,L388080,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there."
223774,L388076,u6626,m442,NYAH,Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
223775,L388075,u6622,m442,ETHAN,What wouldn't make him suspicious?
223776,L388074,u6626,m442,NYAH,Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
223777,L388073,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Then feel better!..
223778,L388072,u6626,m442,NYAH,Much.
223779,L388071,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?"
223780,L388070,u6626,m442,NYAH,Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
223781,L388069,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Can you think of a better one?
223782,L388068,u6626,m442,NYAH,And that's the only reason?
223783,L388067,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands."
223784,L388066,u6626,m442,NYAH,Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
223785,L388065,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I don't.
223786,L388064,u6626,m442,NYAH,"No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?"
223787,L388063,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You can be a thief and have a conscience.
223788,L388062,u6626,m442,NYAH,But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
223789,L388061,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Something like that.
223790,L388060,u6626,m442,NYAH,You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
223791,L388059,u6622,m442,ETHAN,So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
223792,L388058,u6626,m442,NYAH,I'd like a little more conviction..
223793,L388057,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
223794,L388056,u6626,m442,NYAH,But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
223795,L388055,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah."
223796,L388054,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'"
223797,L388052,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Sean Ambrose, for one."
223798,L388051,u6626,m442,NYAH,"That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?"
223799,L388050,u6622,m442,ETHAN,And six billion in the world.
223800,L388049,u6626,m442,NYAH,There's nearly 2 million in London.
223801,L388048,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Five, six-hundred thousand."
223802,L388047,u6626,m442,NYAH,What's the population of Seville any idea?
223803,L387988,u6626,m442,NYAH,That's because I'm on my back.
223804,L387987,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Damn, you're beautiful."
223805,L387986,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Ask a question, you get an answer!.."
223806,L387985,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Of what?
223807,L387984,u6626,m442,NYAH,Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
223808,L387983,u6622,m442,ETHAN,So do I.  Sort of.
223809,L387982,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief.."
223810,L387981,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
223811,L387980,u6626,m442,NYAH,You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
223812,L387979,u6622,m442,ETHAN,So where did I got right?
223813,L387978,u6626,m442,NYAH,That they're lying.
223814,L387977,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Which is?
223815,L387976,u6626,m442,NYAH,That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
223816,L387975,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
223817,L387974,u6626,m442,NYAH,The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
223818,L387973,u6622,m442,ETHAN,They've got a book for everything.
223819,L387972,u6626,m442,NYAH,They've got a book for this?
223820,L387971,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
223821,L387970,u6626,m442,NYAH,When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
223822,L387968,u6626,m442,NYAH,Who wants to be decent?..
223823,L387967,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Care to wait a decent interval?
223824,L387966,u6626,m442,NYAH,Awfully short notice..
223825,L387964,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?"
223826,L387963,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Ethan Hunt.
223827,L387962,u6626,m442,NYAH,What's you name?
223828,L387955,u6626,m442,NYAH,Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
223829,L387954,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away."
223830,L387953,u6626,m442,NYAH,Your help?  What are you talking about?
223831,L387952,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
223832,L387951,u6626,m442,NYAH,Listen to what?
223833,L387950,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen.."
223834,L387948,u6626,m442,NYAH,Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
223835,L387947,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
223836,L387946,u6626,m442,NYAH,Hola..
223837,L387943,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
223838,L387942,u6626,m442,NYAH,You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
223839,L387941,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You didn't do that badly.
223840,L387940,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance.."
223841,L387939,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
223842,L387938,u6626,m442,NYAH,"May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?"
223843,L387937,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
223844,L387936,u6626,m442,NYAH,"If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?"
223845,L387935,u6622,m442,ETHAN,At least you walked.
223846,L387934,u6626,m442,NYAH,"I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing."
223847,L387931,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?"
223848,L387930,u6626,m442,NYAH,Indeed.
223849,L387929,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?"
223850,L387922,u6626,m442,NYAH,Do what?
223851,L387921,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I wouldn't do that.
223852,L387920,u6626,m442,NYAH,- right..
223853,L387919,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told."
223854,L387918,u6626,m442,NYAH,- this is very disconerting..
223855,L387917,u6622,m442,ETHAN,- torque wrench.
223856,L387916,u6626,m442,NYAH,Where's the bloody -
223857,L387915,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Far right.
223858,L387914,u6626,m442,NYAH,- right..where is it?
223859,L387910,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Oh, either way works for me."
223860,L387909,u6626,m442,NYAH,Would you mind if I'm on top?
223861,L387907,u6626,m442,NYAH,I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
223862,L387906,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
223863,L387905,u6626,m442,NYAH,What are you doing here?
223864,L387901,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Uh-huh?
223865,L387900,u6626,m442,NYAH,Uh-huh.
223866,L387899,u6622,m442,ETHAN,What if I pay the rent?
223867,L387898,u6626,m442,NYAH,"Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice."
223868,L387897,u6622,m442,ETHAN,There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
223869,L387896,u6626,m442,NYAH,Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
223870,L387895,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
223871,L387894,u6626,m442,NYAH,No.  Just as if I'd like to.
223872,L387893,u6622,m442,ETHAN,No.  You just looked as if you did.
223873,L387892,u6626,m442,NYAH,No.  Should I?
223874,L387891,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Do you know me?
223875,L388579,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did."
223876,L388578,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
223877,L388577,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Well, Hunt, what are your plans?"
223878,L388576,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I don't.  No exactly.
223879,L388575,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?"
223880,L388574,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I do.
223881,L388573,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve."
223882,L388572,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"No, I don't.  But in this case -"
223883,L388570,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"By fire.  That's the best way, really."
223884,L388569,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed."
223885,L388568,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera."
223886,L388567,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon."
223887,L388566,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Yes.
223888,L388565,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
223889,L388564,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Yes, I gathered as much."
223890,L388563,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies."
223891,L388562,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
223892,L388561,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
223893,L388560,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
223894,L388559,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?"
223895,L388462,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt.."
223896,L388461,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
223897,L388460,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Something else?
223898,L388459,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive."
223899,L388458,u6622,m442,ETHAN,She sacrificed herself..
223900,L388457,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth."
223901,L388455,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious."
223902,L388454,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
223903,L388453,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
223904,L388452,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Yes, I believe that's right."
223905,L388451,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market."
223906,L388450,u6622,m442,ETHAN,We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
223907,L388449,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects."
223908,L388448,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
223909,L388044,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job."
223910,L388043,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Very.
223911,L388042,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,You mean it'll be difficult.
223912,L388041,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I don't think I can get her to do it.
223913,L388040,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
223914,L388039,u6622,m442,ETHAN,She's got no training for this kind of thing.
223915,L388038,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done."
223916,L388037,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
223917,L388036,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
223918,L388035,u6622,m442,ETHAN,And then what?
223919,L388034,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
223920,L388033,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Excuse me?
223921,L388032,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,- is where Miss Hall comes in.
223922,L388031,u6622,m442,ETHAN,If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
223923,L388030,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
223924,L388029,u6622,m442,ETHAN,'Terrorists?'
223925,L388028,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
223926,L388027,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it."
223927,L388026,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us."
223928,L388025,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Right now only Ambrose knows that.
223929,L388024,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
223930,L388023,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
223931,L388022,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
223932,L388021,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
223933,L388020,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Then you do think it was Ambrose.
223934,L388019,u6622,m442,ETHAN,So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
223935,L388017,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Not necessarily.
223936,L388016,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
223937,L388015,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,What did you think of him?
223938,L388014,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Twice.
223939,L388013,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?"
223940,L388012,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,You were there.
223941,L388011,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?"
223942,L388010,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,"Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies.."
223943,L388009,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
223944,L388008,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Like?
223945,L388007,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"An idea, yeah."
223946,L388000,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You gotta be kidding.
223947,L387999,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
223948,L387998,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Like what?
223949,L387997,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Why did you phrase it like that?
223950,L387996,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
223951,L387995,u6628,m442,SWANBECK,Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
223952,L387994,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
223953,L388003,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,I'm fine..
223954,L388002,u6622,m442,ETHAN,..I'm fine..and you?
223955,L387875,u6622,m442,ETHAN,You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
223956,L387874,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri."
223957,L387868,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>"
223958,L387867,u6622,m442,ETHAN,..not in time to save him.
223959,L387866,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"Yes, he knew.  Just.."
223960,L387865,u6622,m442,ETHAN,He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
223961,L387864,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you."
223962,L387863,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
223963,L387862,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri."
223964,L387861,u6622,m442,ETHAN,They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
223965,L387860,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious."
223966,L387859,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor.."
223967,L388582,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Good job.  And thanks.
223968,L388581,u6623,m442,LUTHER,So what did he say?
223969,L388544,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
223970,L388543,u6623,m442,LUTHER,She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
223971,L388542,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Luther, say again."
223972,L388472,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds."
223973,L388471,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?"
223974,L388366,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
223975,L388365,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Luther, I'm looking at security."
223976,L388357,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out."
223977,L388356,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
223978,L388349,u6623,m442,LUTHER,No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
223979,L388348,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Now how to get in there.
223980,L388345,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building."
223981,L388344,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Let's start from the inside out.
223982,L388341,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Nyah still on the property?
223983,L388340,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure.."
223984,L388332,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"You've got the voice print, I'll get us in.."
223985,L388331,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
223986,L388330,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere."
223987,L388329,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus."
223988,L388291,u6622,m442,ETHAN,I told her to get outta there.
223989,L388290,u6623,m442,LUTHER,She must still be on the property.
223990,L388289,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah."
223991,L388213,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --"
223992,L388212,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Left jacket pocket confirmed.
223993,L388211,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
223994,L388210,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Roger that.
223995,L388209,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Left jacket pocket?
223996,L388208,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket..."
223997,L388203,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Yep.
223998,L388202,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Nekhorvich's boss?
223999,L388160,u6623,m442,LUTHER,Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
224000,L388159,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims."
224001,L388152,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Why not?
224002,L388151,u6623,m442,LUTHER,"That simple, huh?"
224003,L388150,u6622,m442,ETHAN,"Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon."
224004,L388104,u6623,m442,LUTHER,The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
224005,L388103,u6622,m442,ETHAN,Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
224006,L388102,u6623,m442,LUTHER,It's the transponder.
224007,L388322,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him."
224008,L388321,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,"Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!.."
224009,L388320,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
224010,L388319,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,"You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless."
224011,L388318,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,By asking me.
224012,L388317,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,"Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?"
224013,L388316,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well."
224014,L388315,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
224015,L388314,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,Do I?
224016,L388313,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,You have Bellerophon.
224017,L388298,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend."
224018,L388297,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,"It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?"
224019,L388296,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,"Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live."
224020,L388295,u6624,m442,MCCLOY,What's happening here?  You're dead!
224021,L388294,u6625,m442,NEKHORVICH,A visit from an old friend.
224022,L388613,u6636,m443,KASIMOV,"Yes, Anatoly, yes."
224023,L388612,u6630,m443,ANATOLY,To friends.
224024,L388609,u6630,m443,ANATOLY,Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
224025,L388608,u6636,m443,KASIMOV,His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
224026,L388607,u6630,m443,ANATOLY,Come on!
224027,L388603,u6636,m443,KASIMOV,"You're right, of course."
224028,L388602,u6630,m443,ANATOLY,You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
224029,L388601,u6636,m443,KASIMOV,They'll kill me.
224030,L388600,u6630,m443,ANATOLY,"C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon."
224031,L388595,u6636,m443,KASIMOV,"I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun."
224032,L388594,u6630,m443,ANATOLY,"Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us."
224033,L389160,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Good idea.
224034,L389159,u6631,m443,BARNES,"Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops."
224035,L389158,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,This is bullshit - we dont even know what Max looks like.
224036,L389157,u6631,m443,BARNES,"Nothing but civilians, Gene."
224037,L389143,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,I dont know.  It didnt say on the tickets.
224038,L389142,u6631,m443,BARNES,What kind of show.
224039,L389141,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Hes putting on a show, Barnes."
224040,L389140,u6631,m443,BARNES,But why tell us?
224041,L389139,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
224042,L389138,u6631,m443,BARNES,Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
224043,L389137,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
224044,L389136,u6631,m443,BARNES,Only four more cars.
224045,L389024,u6631,m443,BARNES,What about him...?
224046,L389023,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
224047,L389018,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Okay!
224048,L389017,u6631,m443,BARNES,Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
224049,L389016,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!"
224050,L388983,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,S.O.P..
224051,L388982,u6631,m443,BARNES,That's S.O.P..
224052,L388920,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodys got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
224053,L388919,u6631,m443,BARNES,So what do you suggest?
224054,L388918,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!"
224055,L388917,u6631,m443,BARNES,Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
224056,L388916,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface."
224057,L389201,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Yes.
224058,L389200,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?"
224059,L389199,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Dont Jim.
224060,L389192,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Fold it.  Fold it tight.
224061,L389191,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,All ten million.
224062,L389190,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Satisfied?
224063,L389183,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
224064,L389182,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
224065,L389179,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer."
224066,L389178,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.."
224067,L389177,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisll have to be quicker than Id like. Certainly quicker than youd like.
224068,L389174,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?"
224069,L389173,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,You knew about Jim?
224070,L389032,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
224071,L389031,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Krieger.
224072,L389030,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,"I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this."
224073,L388949,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,May take a little time.
224074,L388948,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Krieger can get it.  Right?
224075,L388937,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,"If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA."
224076,L388936,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Always.
224077,L388935,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,Is he serious?
224078,L389208,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"I always have, Claire.."
224079,L389207,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you..."
224080,L389206,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Claire.
224081,L389205,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,This stuff is so sticky.
224082,L389204,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Claire...Hey...
224083,L389171,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Ethan?
224084,L389170,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
224085,L389169,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
224086,L389147,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
224087,L389146,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Two cars.  Where are you?
224088,L389145,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
224089,L389144,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
224090,L389122,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
224091,L389121,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Is this the only way?
224092,L389120,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Okay...
224093,L389119,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
224094,L389118,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What happened?
224095,L389067,u6633,m443,ETHAN,He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
224096,L389066,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What are you going to do?
224097,L389064,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Bastard!
224098,L389063,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Kittridge...
224099,L389045,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,I'm going to try and get some sleep.
224100,L389044,u6633,m443,ETHAN,We did what we had to do.
224101,L389043,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan."
224102,L388971,u6633,m443,ETHAN,What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
224103,L388970,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What about you?
224104,L388969,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I just need you to be safe.
224105,L388968,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,You didn't have to.........
224106,L388967,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I didn't say that.
224107,L388966,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,You don't think we're going to make it.
224108,L388965,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away."
224109,L388964,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Sure...
224110,L388963,u6633,m443,ETHAN,May I come in?
224111,L388927,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What kind of help?
224112,L388926,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local."
224113,L388925,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
224114,L388924,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You're sure about this?
224115,L388923,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you."
224116,L388922,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job."
224117,L388921,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Max made a deal with you?
224118,L388856,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I'm going to answer it.
224119,L388855,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,The message is for Job.
224120,L388854,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me."
224121,L388853,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do..."
224122,L388852,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me."
224123,L388851,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What are you going to do?
224124,L388850,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list."
224125,L388849,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Why haven't they brought us in yet?
224126,L388848,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!"
224127,L388847,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
224128,L388846,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"Who is they, who is they?"
224129,L388845,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Did they send you...Did they send you?
224130,L388844,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"Who is ""they?"""
224131,L388843,u6633,m443,ETHAN,That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
224132,L388842,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
224133,L388841,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Where were you?
224134,L388840,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Take off your God damn coat!
224135,L388839,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What?
224136,L388838,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Take off your coat.
224137,L388837,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,They're dead.  Jim's dead.
224138,L388835,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What happened to Jim?
224139,L388834,u6633,m443,ETHAN,There was nobody on the bridge.
224140,L388833,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,What happened to Jim?
224141,L388832,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
224142,L388831,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge."
224143,L388830,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
224144,L388829,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
224145,L388828,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You were in the car!
224146,L388827,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Don't move.
224147,L388826,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,"Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?"
224148,L388734,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Roger that.
224149,L388733,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes."
224150,L388625,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Oh yeah?
224151,L388624,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch."
224152,L388623,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
224153,L388622,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Sleeping's better.
224154,L388621,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Talking's good, walking's better."
224155,L388620,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,I'm walking.
224156,L388619,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Walk, just walk.  Start walking."
224157,L388618,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
224158,L388617,u6633,m443,ETHAN,We got it.  On your feet.
224159,L388616,u6632,m443,CLAIRE,Did we get it?
224160,L389078,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?"
224161,L389077,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?"
224162,L389076,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Certainly Ethan.
224163,L389075,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Can I ask you something, Kittridge?"
224164,L389070,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?"
224165,L389069,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I see you've been out visiting the folks.
224166,L389068,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Kittridge.
224167,L388817,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset."
224168,L388816,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Ethan, I can understand you're very upset."
224169,L388815,u6633,m443,ETHAN,How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
224170,L388814,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane..."
224171,L388812,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived."
224172,L388811,u6633,m443,ETHAN,This whole operation was a molehunt.
224173,L388810,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  ""Golitsyn"" was a lightning rod, one of ours."
224174,L388809,u6633,m443,ETHAN,But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
224175,L388808,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as ""Job 314"".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight."
224176,L388807,u6633,m443,ETHAN,The arms dealer.
224177,L388806,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as ""Max."""
224178,L388805,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
224179,L388804,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?"
224180,L388803,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,I don't quite follow you.
224181,L388802,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
224182,L388801,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,What?
224183,L388800,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Why was there another team?
224184,L388799,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Yes.  I see your point.
224185,L388798,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Who else is left?
224186,L388797,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan."
224187,L388796,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
224188,L388795,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,We've lost enough agents for one night.
224189,L388794,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Yeah.  I follow you.
224190,L388793,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?"
224191,L388792,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Yeah.
224192,L388791,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally."
224193,L388790,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,One hour.
224194,L388789,u6633,m443,ETHAN,No sir.
224195,L388788,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me."
224196,L388787,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Youre in Prague?
224197,L388786,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
224198,L388785,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Yes.
224199,L388784,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?"
224200,L388783,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I dont think so.
224201,L388782,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,"Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?"
224202,L388781,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
224203,L388780,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,<u>Are you intact</u>?
224204,L388779,u6633,m443,ETHAN,They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns dead too.  The disk is gone.
224205,L388778,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Are you damaged?
224206,L388777,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know"
224207,L388776,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Whos dead?
224208,L388775,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Theyre dead.
224209,L388774,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,Go ahead.
224210,L388773,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Go secure.
224211,L388772,u6637,m443,KITTRIDGE,This is Kittridge.
224212,L389236,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way."
224213,L389235,u6639,m443,LUTHER,Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
224214,L389234,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?"
224215,L389233,u6639,m443,LUTHER,"You really liked Phelps, didn't you?"
224216,L389232,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
224217,L389231,u6639,m443,LUTHER,Why don't you come back with me?
224218,L389230,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?"
224219,L389229,u6639,m443,LUTHER,"I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it."
224220,L389228,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
224221,L389227,u6639,m443,LUTHER,Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
224222,L389226,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in."
224223,L389225,u6639,m443,LUTHER,"Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!"
224224,L389224,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list."
224225,L389222,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
224226,L389221,u6639,m443,LUTHER,"The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards."
224227,L389220,u6633,m443,ETHAN,About what?
224228,L389219,u6639,m443,LUTHER,Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
224229,L389053,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I'll get you close.
224230,L389052,u6639,m443,LUTHER,It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
224231,L389051,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?"
224232,L389050,u6639,m443,LUTHER,I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
224233,L389049,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it."
224234,L389048,u6639,m443,LUTHER,What makes you trust me?
224235,L389047,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Now I want you to hold onto it.
224236,L389046,u6639,m443,LUTHER,Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
224237,L388956,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down."
224238,L388955,u6639,m443,LUTHER,"I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal."
224239,L388954,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses."
224240,L388953,u6639,m443,LUTHER,And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
224241,L388951,u6639,m443,LUTHER,"Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --"
224242,L388950,u6633,m443,ETHAN,May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
224243,L388947,u6639,m443,LUTHER,You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
224244,L388946,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
224245,L388945,u6639,m443,LUTHER,There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
224246,L388944,u6633,m443,ETHAN,This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
224247,L388941,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Profitable.
224248,L388940,u6639,m443,LUTHER,What kind?
224249,L388939,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Information.
224250,L388938,u6639,m443,LUTHER,What are we downloading?
224251,L389135,u6641,m443,MAX,I wouldnt worry about him.  Once youve got the money -- hell find you.
224252,L389134,u6633,m443,ETHAN,What about Job?
224253,L389133,u6641,m443,MAX,"The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314."
224254,L389132,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is."
224255,L389131,u6641,m443,MAX,"Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private."
224256,L388915,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I wouldn't dream of it.
224257,L388914,u6641,m443,MAX,I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
224258,L388913,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
224259,L388912,u6641,m443,MAX,How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
224260,L388911,u6633,m443,ETHAN,How will you make sure Job will be there?
224261,L388910,u6641,m443,MAX,Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
224262,L388909,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange."
224263,L388908,u6641,m443,MAX,"Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world."
224264,L388907,u6633,m443,ETHAN,What was your deal with Job?
224265,L388906,u6641,m443,MAX,I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
224266,L388905,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?"
224267,L388894,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first."
224268,L388893,u6641,m443,MAX,Very good.
224269,L388892,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
224270,L388891,u6641,m443,MAX,Mm - Hmmm...
224271,L388890,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits."
224272,L388889,u6641,m443,MAX,"It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir."
224273,L388888,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location."
224274,L388887,u6641,m443,MAX,Why should I?
224275,L388886,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction."
224276,L388885,u6641,m443,MAX,I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
224277,L388884,u6633,m443,ETHAN,That's the question I want to ask Job.
224278,L388883,u6641,m443,MAX,"Why, may I ask?"
224279,L388882,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
224280,L388881,u6641,m443,MAX,"Ah, but, we're asking about you."
224281,L388880,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Like Job?
224282,L388879,u6641,m443,MAX,And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
224283,L388878,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt."
224284,L388877,u6641,m443,MAX,It's quite out of the question.
224285,L388876,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
224286,L388875,u6641,m443,MAX,On what?
224287,L388874,u6633,m443,ETHAN,That depends.
224288,L388873,u6641,m443,MAX,"The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox."
224289,L388872,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
224290,L388871,u6641,m443,MAX,Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
224291,L388870,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I need one hundred thousand dollars.
224292,L388869,u6641,m443,MAX,Who are you and what are you doing here?
224293,L388995,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Let's move!
224294,L388994,u6634,m443,GUARD RANDALL,Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
224295,L388990,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
224296,L388989,u6634,m443,GUARD RANDALL,Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
224297,L388988,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I gotta go in there and shut it down!
224298,L388987,u6634,m443,GUARD RANDALL,"Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one."
224299,L388986,u6633,m443,ETHAN,What sector's the air conditioning?
224300,L389035,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"What's the matter, you don't know this trick?"
224301,L389034,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,That's not it.  That's not the list.
224302,L389029,u6633,m443,ETHAN,My contact is extremely shy.
224303,L389028,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,You're not going to any meeting without me.
224304,L389015,u6633,m443,ETHAN,We're not outta here yet.
224305,L389014,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,Merci.
224306,L389002,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Time up.
224307,L389001,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,We'll see.
224308,L389000,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Zero body count.
224309,L388932,u6633,m443,ETHAN,In Langley.
224310,L388931,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,Where exactly is it?
224311,L388930,u6633,m443,ETHAN,IMF mainframe.
224312,L388929,u6638,m443,KRIEGER,Bank?
224313,L388928,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
224314,L388737,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport."
224315,L388736,u6635,m443,JACK,Roger that.  Opening doors now.
224316,L388735,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll."
224317,L388730,u6635,m443,JACK,"Give me a break, Pops."
224318,L388729,u6633,m443,ETHAN,He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
224319,L388723,u6635,m443,JACK,I didn't touch it.
224320,L388722,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Jack.  Jack.
224321,L388687,u6635,m443,JACK,Just don't chew it.
224322,L388686,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Give me the God damn gum.
224323,L388682,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Always.
224324,L388681,u6635,m443,JACK,"Sorry, am I interrupting?"
224325,L388629,u6635,m443,JACK,"Just waiting for you, tubs."
224326,L388628,u6633,m443,ETHAN,IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
224327,L388627,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Jack.
224328,L388626,u6635,m443,JACK,Claire.
224329,L388761,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"No, were going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!"
224330,L388760,u6643,m443,SARAH,"Jim gave an abort, we should walk away."
224331,L388759,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you."
224332,L388755,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Jim we cant.
224333,L388754,u6643,m443,SARAH,Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
224334,L388750,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
224335,L388749,u6643,m443,SARAH,The package is in the open.
224336,L388726,u6643,m443,SARAH,What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
224337,L388725,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors."
224338,L388719,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Right, right.  Good."
224339,L388718,u6643,m443,SARAH,Higher.
224340,L388717,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Higher.  Higher.
224341,L388900,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I'd say you've got about two minutes.
224342,L388899,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Forty-four.  Forty-five.
224343,L388868,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Very well.
224344,L388867,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I'm willing to take the chance.
224345,L388866,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,"If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely."
224346,L388865,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
224347,L388864,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
224348,L388863,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Then what am I doing here?
224349,L388862,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
224350,L388861,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I thought I was going to see Max.
224351,L388860,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
224352,L388859,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Why?
224353,L388858,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Would you remove your hat please?
224354,L389203,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Ethan - Ive always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you."
224355,L389202,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Jim, its over."
224356,L389196,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
224357,L389195,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
224358,L389194,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Dont flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
224359,L389193,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
224360,L389188,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Keep counting Claire.
224361,L389187,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?"
224362,L389181,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"But, he didnt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  ""Thou shall not covet thy Neighbours wife"", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - ""does she feel the same way I do?"""
224363,L389180,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I knew about Jim.
224364,L389176,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"They stamped it, didnt they?  Those damn Gideons."
224365,L389175,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
224366,L389117,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Good luck.
224367,L389116,u6633,m443,ETHAN,And get a doctor.
224368,L389115,u6642,m443,PHELPS,You got it.
224369,L389114,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris."
224370,L389113,u6642,m443,PHELPS,I usually am.
224371,L389112,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Youre probably right.
224372,L389111,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan."
224373,L389110,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.."
224374,L389109,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Jim...?
224375,L389108,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris."
224376,L389107,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
224377,L389106,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris."
224378,L389105,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you."
224379,L389104,u6633,m443,ETHAN,What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
224380,L389103,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Whats going to make him do that?
224381,L389102,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us."
224382,L389101,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!"
224383,L389094,u6633,m443,ETHAN,How did Kittridge do it?..
224384,L389093,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Yeah.
224385,L389092,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
224386,L389091,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>"
224387,L389090,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight."
224388,L389089,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I remember..
224389,L389088,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Hey, I showed 'em to you!"
224390,L389087,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
224391,L389086,u6642,m443,PHELPS,- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
224392,L389085,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -"
224393,L389084,u6642,m443,PHELPS,- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..

224395,L389082,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases."
224396,L388764,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Theyre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications."
224397,L388763,u6633,m443,ETHAN,About two hundred yards from the bridge.
224398,L388762,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Where are you?
224399,L388757,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move."
224400,L388756,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Abort.  Thats an order.
224401,L388753,u6642,m443,PHELPS,No.  Abort.
224402,L388752,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Can you lose him?
224403,L388751,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Ive got a shadow.
224404,L388711,u6633,m443,ETHAN,We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
224405,L388710,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
224406,L388680,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?"
224407,L388679,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Sure.  If the main character does.
224408,L388678,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?"
224409,L388677,u6633,m443,ETHAN,He won't be back in a hurry?
224410,L388676,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides."
224411,L388675,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
224412,L388674,u6642,m443,PHELPS,He's our guy.
224413,L388673,u6633,m443,ETHAN,You're going to use Walter?
224414,L388669,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says ""All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?""  She says no. ""Oh, it was my friend Sammy.""  She says it wasn't Sammy.  ""Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou.""  ""No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"""
224415,L388668,u6633,m443,ETHAN,How was Chicago?
224416,L388667,u6642,m443,PHELPS,Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
224417,L388666,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Why not?
224418,L388665,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out."
224419,L388664,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I guess.
224420,L388663,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?"
224421,L388662,u6633,m443,ETHAN,What problem?
224422,L388661,u6642,m443,PHELPS,When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
224423,L388660,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Tell you what?
224424,L388659,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me."
224425,L388658,u6633,m443,ETHAN,Oh?  What's the problem?
224426,L388657,u6642,m443,PHELPS,What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
224427,L388656,u6633,m443,ETHAN,I thought I'd take some now.
224428,L388655,u6642,m443,PHELPS,"A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one."
224429,L388654,u6633,m443,ETHAN,"Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming."
224430,L388732,u6635,m443,JACK,And a lonely ass.
224431,L388731,u6643,m443,SARAH,Such a nice ass.
224432,L388653,u6643,m443,SARAH,I think I might just take that look.
224433,L388652,u6635,m443,JACK,Too wicked to have a drink later?
224434,L388651,u6643,m443,SARAH,Jack you're so wicked.
224435,L388650,u6635,m443,JACK,That's what we do isn't it?
224436,L388649,u6643,m443,SARAH,Jack...that's spying.
224437,L388648,u6635,m443,JACK,Why don't you take a look?
224438,L388647,u6643,m443,SARAH,I don't know.
224439,L388646,u6635,m443,JACK,What's going on?
224440,L388645,u6643,m443,SARAH,Loud and clear.
224441,L388644,u6635,m443,JACK,"No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?"
224442,L388643,u6643,m443,SARAH,Of course I can hear you.
224443,L388642,u6635,m443,JACK,"Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?"
224444,L389163,u6641,m443,MAX,Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
224445,L389162,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Its working.
224446,L389156,u6641,m443,MAX,Run it through from the top.
224447,L389155,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,I always check the batteries.
224448,L389154,u6641,m443,MAX,Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
224449,L389153,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Its not working.
224450,L389152,u6641,m443,MAX,Try it again.
224451,L389151,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Connection denied.
224452,L389150,u6641,m443,MAX,Whats the problem.
224453,L389129,u6641,m443,MAX,This wasnt what we discussed.
224454,L389128,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Yes...  Its him.
224455,L389127,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Twenty minutes.
224456,L389126,u6641,m443,MAX,How long until we reach the Chunnel?
224457,L388898,u6641,m443,MAX,Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
224458,L388897,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,Thirty-two and change.
224459,L388896,u6641,m443,MAX,"That's not so good for you, my friend."
224460,L388895,u6640,m443,MATTHIAS,"Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good."
224461,L390876,u6648,m444,GREGORY,"I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you."
224462,L390875,u6644,m444,AVA,"Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened."
224463,L390874,u6648,m444,GREGORY,"Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain."
224464,L390873,u6644,m444,AVA,The Shawfish?
224465,L390872,u6648,m444,GREGORY,"No, I'm going."
224466,L390871,u6644,m444,AVA,"Oh, you're not going. You're staying."
224467,L390858,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
224468,L390857,u6645,m444,BOBO,"I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny."
224469,L390812,u6645,m444,BOBO,Very good.
224470,L390811,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"No, I want to see the dessert cart."
224471,L390778,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,And I'll have the special fish.
224472,L390777,u6645,m444,BOBO,Uh-huh
224473,L390776,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,We will both have the Salad Ticino.
224474,L390775,u6645,m444,BOBO,"Very good, Mr. Johnny."
224475,L390774,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?"
224476,L390773,u6645,m444,BOBO,Are you ready?
224477,L391577,u6660,m444,ROSE,Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
224478,L391576,u6646,m444,COSMO,"A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day."
224479,L391575,u6660,m444,ROSE,And go to confession.
224480,L391574,u6646,m444,COSMO,Okay.

224482,L391572,u6646,m444,COSMO,Yes.
224483,L391571,u6660,m444,ROSE,Have I been a good wife?
224484,L391566,u6646,m444,COSMO,His brother.
224485,L391565,u6660,m444,ROSE,"Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother."
224486,L391528,u6646,m444,COSMO,I'm going to bed now.
224487,L391527,u6660,m444,ROSE,You're welcome.
224488,L391526,u6646,m444,COSMO,"Thank you, Rose."
224489,L391525,u6660,m444,ROSE,"I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else."
224490,L391524,u6646,m444,COSMO,What?
224491,L391523,u6660,m444,ROSE,Cosmo?
224492,L391516,u6646,m444,COSMO,"I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend."
224493,L391515,u6660,m444,ROSE,Where you been?
224494,L391167,u6660,m444,ROSE,Why you drinking so much?
224495,L391166,u6646,m444,COSMO,Rita. Pass the wine.
224496,L391165,u6660,m444,ROSE,"Well, what do you wanna talk about!"
224497,L391164,u6646,m444,COSMO,I don't wanna talk about it.
224498,L390967,u6660,m444,ROSE,"He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die."
224499,L390966,u6646,m444,COSMO,I won't pay for nothing.
224500,L390965,u6660,m444,ROSE,"You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo."
224501,L390964,u6646,m444,COSMO,I have no money!
224502,L390956,u6660,m444,ROSE,"You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?"
224503,L390955,u6646,m444,COSMO,I don't like him.
224504,L390954,u6660,m444,ROSE,Again? Johnny Cammareri.
224505,L390953,u6646,m444,COSMO,Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
224506,L390952,u6660,m444,ROSE,Who's dead?
224507,L391163,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,No. You were there.
224508,L391162,u6646,m444,COSMO,You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
224509,L391161,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,"I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better."
224510,L391160,u6646,m444,COSMO,"Rose, pass the wine."
224511,L391156,u6646,m444,COSMO,I don't wanna talk about it.
224512,L391155,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
224513,L391154,u6646,m444,COSMO,I don't wanna talk about it.
224514,L391522,u6646,m444,COSMO,And that's how much I'm saying.
224515,L391521,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,You haven't said anything.
224516,L391520,u6646,m444,COSMO,I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
224517,L391519,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I don't know what you mean.
224518,L391518,u6646,m444,COSMO,"You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips."
224519,L391517,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I have my eyes open.
224520,L391514,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"Hello, Mr. Castorini."
224521,L391513,u6646,m444,COSMO,Hi.  Hi.
224522,L391415,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I don't know whether I saw you or not.
224523,L391414,u6646,m444,COSMO,Alright. I didn't see you here.
224524,L391413,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You're my father.
224525,L391412,u6646,m444,COSMO,You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
224526,L391411,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You're married.
224527,L391410,u6646,m444,COSMO,Who is this man? You're engaged!
224528,L391409,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What are you doing here?
224529,L391408,u6646,m444,COSMO,What are you doing here?
224530,L391407,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I got it done.
224531,L391406,u6646,m444,COSMO,What'd you do to your hair?
224532,L391405,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Mona?
224533,L390950,u6646,m444,COSMO,Let's go tell your Mother.
224534,L390949,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"So you'll come to the wedding, right?"
224535,L390948,u6646,m444,COSMO,Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
224536,L390947,u6649,m444,LORETTA,It's temporary.
224537,L390946,u6646,m444,COSMO,It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
224538,L390945,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Here.
224539,L390944,u6646,m444,COSMO,That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
224540,L390943,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Yeah.
224541,L390942,u6646,m444,COSMO,He did?
224542,L390941,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino."
224543,L390940,u6646,m444,COSMO,Maybe.
224544,L390939,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had."
224545,L390938,u6646,m444,COSMO,I didn't give you away the first time.
224546,L390937,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
224547,L390936,u6646,m444,COSMO,I won't come.
224548,L390935,u6649,m444,LORETTA,In a month.
224549,L390934,u6646,m444,COSMO,"More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?"
224550,L390933,u6649,m444,LORETTA,He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
224551,L390932,u6646,m444,COSMO,Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
224552,L390931,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Johnny Cammareri.
224553,L390930,u6646,m444,COSMO,"No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?"
224554,L390929,u6649,m444,LORETTA,He got hit by a bus.
224555,L390928,u6646,m444,COSMO,What killed him?
224556,L390927,u6649,m444,LORETTA,The guy died.
224557,L390926,u6646,m444,COSMO,You did this once it didn't work out.
224558,L390925,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Yeah.
224559,L390924,u6646,m444,COSMO,Again?
224560,L390923,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm getting married.
224561,L390922,u6646,m444,COSMO,What's your news?
224562,L390921,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You look tired.
224563,L390920,u6646,m444,COSMO,Ti amo.
224564,L390919,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Here.  Ti amo.
224565,L390917,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Pop, I got news."
224566,L390916,u6646,m444,COSMO,I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
224567,L390915,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You're not sleepy?
224568,L390914,u6646,m444,COSMO,Bed.
224569,L390913,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Where's Ma?
224570,L391389,u6651,m444,MONA,I'm wearing your bracelet.
224571,L391388,u6646,m444,COSMO,I don't know. I got a feeling.
224572,L391387,u6651,m444,MONA,Why you looking around so much?
224573,L391386,u6646,m444,COSMO,I like your dress.  It's very bright.
224574,L391385,u6651,m444,MONA,You haven't once said you like my dress.
224575,L391076,u6646,m444,COSMO,"They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess."
224576,L391075,u6651,m444,MONA,"Oh, Cosmo!"
224577,L391073,u6646,m444,COSMO,I brought you something.
224578,L391072,u6651,m444,MONA,You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
224579,L391071,u6646,m444,COSMO,"The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right."
224580,L391070,u6651,m444,MONA,And what did they say?
224581,L391069,u6646,m444,COSMO,"And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money."
224582,L391306,u6647,m444,FELIX,"Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes."
224583,L391305,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,Yes!
224584,L391299,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,"I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous."
224585,L391298,u6647,m444,FELIX,We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
224586,L391295,u6647,m444,FELIX,Hurry up.
224587,L391294,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,"At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house."
224588,L390987,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,"You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other."
224589,L390986,u6647,m444,FELIX,I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
224590,L390975,u6647,m444,FELIX,You have too many dogs.
224591,L390974,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
224592,L390971,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,"Good morning, Lucy."
224593,L390970,u6647,m444,FELIX,It's wrong to just let them go.
224594,L391649,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!"
224595,L391648,u6659,m444,RONNY,"Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?"
224596,L391643,u6659,m444,RONNY,Will you marry me.
224597,L391642,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What!
224598,L391641,u6659,m444,RONNY,Loretta?
224599,L391632,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
224600,L391631,u6659,m444,RONNY,"Loretta, what are you talking about?"
224601,L391630,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
224602,L391583,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?"
224603,L391582,u6659,m444,RONNY,"No, I'll tell him."
224604,L391562,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Ronny, please..."
224605,L391561,u6659,m444,RONNY,No. I'm gonna wait.
224606,L391560,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You've gotta get outta here.
224607,L391557,u6659,m444,RONNY,"Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother."
224608,L391556,u6649,m444,LORETTA,He's coming.
224609,L391555,u6659,m444,RONNY,Is Johnny here?
224610,L391554,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Ronny!
224611,L391481,u6659,m444,RONNY,"Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!"
224612,L391480,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm freezing to death.
224613,L391479,u6659,m444,RONNY,No.
224614,L391478,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Let me go home.
224615,L391477,u6659,m444,RONNY,No.
224616,L391476,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Let me go home.
224617,L391475,u6659,m444,RONNY,"I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other."
224618,L391474,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Why not?
224619,L391473,u6649,m444,LORETTA,And you're not now?
224620,L391472,u6659,m444,RONNY,I was.
224621,L391471,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm afraid of who I am.
224622,L391470,u6659,m444,RONNY,Why?
224623,L391469,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm really afraid.
224624,L391468,u6659,m444,RONNY,Yeah.
224625,L391467,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?"
224626,L391466,u6649,m444,LORETTA,The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
224627,L391465,u6659,m444,RONNY,Yeah.
224628,L391464,u6649,m444,LORETTA,This is where we're going!
224629,L391463,u6659,m444,RONNY,That's right.
224630,L391462,u6649,m444,LORETTA,This is your place.
224631,L391461,u6659,m444,RONNY,We're here.
224632,L391460,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You're late!
224633,L391459,u6659,m444,RONNY,I'm here!
224634,L391458,u6649,m444,LORETTA,He didn't come!
224635,L391457,u6659,m444,RONNY,"And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?"
224636,L391456,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I know what I know.
224637,L391455,u6659,m444,RONNY,"Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta."
224638,L391454,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You are guilty. I'm guilty.
224639,L391453,u6659,m444,RONNY,You're making me feel guilty again.
224640,L391452,u6649,m444,LORETTA,How can you ask me that?
224641,L391451,u6659,m444,RONNY,What's the matter?
224642,L391449,u6659,m444,RONNY,Yeah. It smells like snow.
224643,L391448,u6649,m444,LORETTA,It's really cold.
224644,L391447,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I wanna go home.
224645,L391446,u6659,m444,RONNY,What do you want to do now?
224646,L391445,u6659,m444,RONNY,I think that's it.
224647,L391444,u6649,m444,LORETTA,No thanks.
224648,L391398,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
224649,L391397,u6659,m444,RONNY,Yeah.
224650,L391396,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Beautiful. Sad. She died!
224651,L391395,u6659,m444,RONNY,Awful?
224652,L391394,u6649,m444,LORETTA,That was just so... awful!
224653,L391384,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I like parts of it, but I don't really get it."
224654,L391383,u6659,m444,RONNY,It's the best thing there is.
224655,L391382,u6649,m444,LORETTA,They get some turnout for this stuff.
224656,L391329,u6659,m444,RONNY,Come on.
224657,L391328,u6649,m444,LORETTA,So. Where are we sitting?
224658,L391327,u6659,m444,RONNY,"I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera."
224659,L391326,u6649,m444,LORETTA,For what?
224660,L391325,u6659,m444,RONNY,Thank you!
224661,L391324,u6659,m444,RONNY,"He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in."
224662,L391323,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Kinda gaudy.
224663,L391322,u6659,m444,RONNY,Marc Chagall. A Russian.
224664,L391321,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Who painted that?
224665,L391319,u6659,m444,RONNY,Thank you.
224666,L391318,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
224667,L391317,u6659,m444,RONNY,You look beautiful. Your hair...
224668,L391316,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Hi.
224669,L391315,u6659,m444,RONNY,Hi.
224670,L391232,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Alright. Where's the Met?
224671,L391231,u6659,m444,RONNY,Alright. Meet me at the Met.
224672,L391230,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Alright.
224673,L391229,u6659,m444,RONNY,"I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life."
224674,L391228,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What are you talking about?
224675,L391227,u6659,m444,RONNY,That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
224676,L391226,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What?
224677,L391225,u6659,m444,RONNY,Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
224678,L391224,u6649,m444,LORETTA,But that's cause he don't know!
224679,L391223,u6659,m444,RONNY,But he wants me to come!
224680,L391222,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm telling you you can't.
224681,L391221,u6659,m444,RONNY,I'll come to the wedding.
224682,L391220,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
224683,L391219,u6659,m444,RONNY,I can't!
224684,L391218,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Snap out of it!
224685,L391217,u6659,m444,RONNY,I'm in love with you!
224686,L391216,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Why not?
224687,L391215,u6659,m444,RONNY,I can't do that!
224688,L391214,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!"
224689,L391213,u6659,m444,RONNY,What?
224690,L391212,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!"
224691,L391211,u6659,m444,RONNY,Oh no I didn't!
224692,L391210,u6649,m444,LORETTA,That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
224693,L391209,u6659,m444,RONNY,You ruined my life.
224694,L391208,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What did I do?
224695,L391207,u6659,m444,RONNY,What did you do?
224696,L391206,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You don't get along with anybody!
224697,L391205,u6659,m444,RONNY,She didn't like me.
224698,L391204,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
224699,L391203,u6659,m444,RONNY,"All right, I'm guilty. I confess!"
224700,L391202,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm marrying your brother!
224701,L391201,u6659,m444,RONNY,You're trying to make me feel guilty.
224702,L391200,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again."
224703,L391199,u6659,m444,RONNY,Don't just become excited.
224704,L391198,u6649,m444,LORETTA,This time I was trying to do everything right.
224705,L391197,u6659,m444,RONNY,Take it easy.
224706,L391196,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What? What have we done?
224707,L391195,u6659,m444,RONNY,What?
224708,L391194,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Oh my God.
224709,L391178,u6659,m444,RONNY,It makes you look like an angel.
224710,L391177,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I've never seen a moon like that.
224711,L391176,u6659,m444,RONNY,It's so bright.
224712,L391174,u6659,m444,RONNY,I don't know. I think it's the moon.
224713,L391173,u6649,m444,LORETTA,That light.
224714,L391172,u6659,m444,RONNY,What?
224715,L391147,u6659,m444,RONNY,Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
224716,L391146,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!"
224717,L391145,u6659,m444,RONNY,What about Johnny?
224718,L391144,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Get all of me. Take everything.
224719,L391143,u6659,m444,RONNY,I've got you.
224720,L391142,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
224721,L391141,u6659,m444,RONNY,Loretta.
224722,L391140,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny."
224723,L391139,u6659,m444,RONNY,Your blood.
224724,L391138,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I was dead, too."
224725,L391137,u6659,m444,RONNY,I was dead.
224726,L391136,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Me neither.
224727,L391135,u6659,m444,RONNY,I can't believe what is happening.
224728,L391134,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
224729,L391133,u6659,m444,RONNY,To the bed.
224730,L391132,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Where are you taking me?
224731,L391131,u6659,m444,RONNY,Son of a bitch!
224732,L391127,u6649,m444,LORETTA,A wolf without a foot!
224733,L391126,u6659,m444,RONNY,A bride without a head!
224734,L391125,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I am looking where I should to become a bride!
224735,L391124,u6659,m444,RONNY,He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
224736,L391123,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Because I have no Luck!
224737,L391122,u6659,m444,RONNY,Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
224738,L391121,u6649,m444,LORETTA,No!
224739,L391120,u6659,m444,RONNY,Stop it!
224740,L391119,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm telling you your life!
224741,L391118,u6659,m444,RONNY,What are you doing!
224742,L391117,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!"
224743,L391116,u6659,m444,RONNY,I'm a wolf?
224744,L391115,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!"
224745,L391114,u6659,m444,RONNY,You don't know nothing about it.
224746,L391113,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"You really are stupid, you know that."
224747,L391112,u6659,m444,RONNY,Yes.
224748,L391111,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You think so?
224749,L391110,u6659,m444,RONNY,She was right to leave me.
224750,L391109,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
224751,L391108,u6659,m444,RONNY,Why you talking to me?
224752,L391107,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
224753,L391106,u6659,m444,RONNY,"I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that."
224754,L391105,u6649,m444,LORETTA,No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
224755,L391104,u6659,m444,RONNY,Stupid yourself.
224756,L391103,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Just Johnny.
224757,L391102,u6659,m444,RONNY,How many men since then?
224758,L391101,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Seven years ago.
224759,L391100,u6659,m444,RONNY,When your husband get hit by the bus?
224760,L391099,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Stupid.
224761,L391098,u6659,m444,RONNY,No.
224762,L391097,u6649,m444,LORETTA,So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
224763,L391096,u6659,m444,RONNY,I don't know.
224764,L391095,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Why what?
224765,L391094,u6659,m444,RONNY,Why?
224766,L391093,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Yesterday.
224767,L391092,u6659,m444,RONNY,When you get engaged?
224768,L391091,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Instantaneous.
224769,L391090,u6659,m444,RONNY,Fast.
224770,L391089,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Bus hit him.
224771,L391088,u6659,m444,RONNY,How'd he die?
224772,L391087,u6649,m444,LORETTA,He knew my husband who died.
224773,L391086,u6659,m444,RONNY,Where'd Johnny find you?
224774,L391085,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Loretta.
224775,L391084,u6659,m444,RONNY,This is good. Uhh...
224776,L391083,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
224777,L391082,u6659,m444,RONNY,I like it well done.
224778,L391081,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I know that. I do what I want.
224779,L391080,u6659,m444,RONNY,You don't have to help me.
224780,L391079,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm making you a steak.
224781,L391078,u6659,m444,RONNY,Loretta. What's that smell?
224782,L391062,u6659,m444,RONNY,"I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?"
224783,L391061,u6649,m444,LORETTA,But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
224784,L391060,u6659,m444,RONNY,That's it.
224785,L391059,u6649,m444,LORETTA,That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
224786,L391058,u6659,m444,RONNY,"It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man."
224787,L391053,u6659,m444,RONNY,"No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!"
224788,L391052,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Maybe I should come back another time.
224789,L391051,u6659,m444,RONNY,Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
224790,L391046,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I don't understand.
224791,L391045,u6659,m444,RONNY,I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
224792,L391044,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Excuse me.
224793,L391043,u6659,m444,RONNY,I have no life.
224794,L391042,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Yes. Do you want...
224795,L391041,u6659,m444,RONNY,You are going to marry my brother?
224796,L391040,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm going to marry him.
224797,L391039,u6659,m444,RONNY,Why?
224798,L391038,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Yes.
224799,L391037,u6659,m444,RONNY,Have you come from my brother?
224800,L391027,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Let me come and talk to you.
224801,L391026,u6659,m444,RONNY,What's wrong can never be made right.
224802,L391025,u6649,m444,LORETTA,He's in Palermo.
224803,L391024,u6659,m444,RONNY,Why didn't he call himself?
224804,L391023,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
224805,L391022,u6659,m444,RONNY,"Yeah, this is Ronny."
224806,L391610,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Johnny.
224807,L391609,u6658,m444,RITA,It's Johnny Cammareri.
224808,L391591,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You? No.
224809,L391590,u6658,m444,RITA,"Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?"
224810,L391587,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Hi.
224811,L391586,u6658,m444,RITA,Hi Loretta.
224812,L391309,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Yeah, I'll be in."
224813,L391308,u6658,m444,RITA,"Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?"
224814,L391307,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Bye, Aunt Rita."
224815,L391292,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita."
224816,L391291,u6658,m444,RITA,What's the matter? You look crazy.
224817,L391288,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Right.
224818,L391287,u6658,m444,RITA,Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
224819,L391286,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I got things to do.
224820,L391645,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Where's the ring?
224821,L391644,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,What?
224822,L391640,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress."
224823,L391639,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"In time, you will see that this is the best thing."
224824,L391637,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I must ask for that back.
224825,L391636,u6649,m444,LORETTA,And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
224826,L391629,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,If I marry you my mother will die.
224827,L391628,u6649,m444,LORETTA,WHAT?
224828,L391627,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"Loretta, I can't marry you."
224829,L391626,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I have no secrets from my family.
224830,L391625,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
224831,L391624,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Johnny, I have something to tell you."
224832,L391621,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
224833,L391620,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I can't. I need my family around me now.
224834,L391619,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,We should talk alone.
224835,L391618,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying."
224836,L391008,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
224837,L391007,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Have you told her we're getting married?
224838,L391004,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
224839,L391003,u6649,m444,LORETTA,How was your plane ride?
224840,L391002,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother."
224841,L390886,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Sure.
224842,L390885,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
224843,L390884,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You have a brother?
224844,L390883,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,He's my younger brother.
224845,L390882,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Who is he?
224846,L390881,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
224847,L390880,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"You've made me very happy, Johnny."
224848,L390879,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
224849,L390870,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up."
224850,L390869,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Yeah.
224851,L390868,u6649,m444,LORETTA,A month from today?
224852,L390867,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Alright. A month. In a month.
224853,L390866,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set."
224854,L390865,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
224855,L390864,u6649,m444,LORETTA,How about a month from today?
224856,L390863,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Then let's set the date.
224857,L390862,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,A week. Two weeks. No more.
224858,L390861,u6649,m444,LORETTA,How near is she to death?
224859,L390860,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married."
224860,L390859,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What about the wedding?
224861,L390855,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time."
224862,L390854,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Seven-thirty.
224863,L390853,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What time is it?
224864,L390845,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
224865,L390844,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I like this ring.
224866,L390834,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Alright.
224867,L390833,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down."
224868,L390832,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,This is a good suit.
224869,L390831,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Yes, on the floor."
224870,L390830,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,On the floor?
224871,L390829,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
224872,L390828,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I don't understand.
224873,L390827,u6649,m444,LORETTA,We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
224874,L390826,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,What do you mean?
224875,L390825,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
224876,L390824,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Yes?
224877,L390823,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Are you proposing marriage to me?
224878,L390822,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Bobo, take the cart away."
224879,L390821,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Will you marry me?
224880,L390820,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What?
224881,L390819,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Will you marry me?
224882,L390818,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I shouldn't.
224883,L390817,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Have Something.
224884,L390816,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
224885,L390815,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What's the matter?
224886,L390814,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Never is a long time.
224887,L390813,u6649,m444,LORETTA,You never have dessert.
224888,L390796,u6649,m444,LORETTA,She was too young for him.
224889,L390795,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,A man who can't control his woman is funny.
224890,L390783,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too."
224891,L390782,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Maybe you're right.
224892,L390781,u6649,m444,LORETTA,It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
224893,L390780,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,No?

224936,L390992,u6660,m444,ROSE,So we'll sell the house.
224937,L390991,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Pop don't like Johnny.
224938,L390990,u6660,m444,ROSE,Why not?
224939,L390989,u6649,m444,LORETTA,No.
224940,L390988,u6660,m444,ROSE,Will you live here?
224941,L390961,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Pop.
224942,L390960,u6660,m444,ROSE,And who's gonna pay for that?
224943,L390959,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception."
224944,L390958,u6660,m444,ROSE,Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
224945,L390957,u6649,m444,LORETTA,No.
224946,L391593,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!"
224947,L391592,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,We just come from the bank.
224948,L391589,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
224949,L391588,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,"Hi, Loretta."
224950,L391283,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,You gotta date?
224951,L391282,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go."
224952,L391281,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,Oh.
224953,L391280,u6649,m444,LORETTA,No.
224954,L391279,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,Did you see it?
224955,L391278,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What about the moon?
224956,L391275,u6649,m444,LORETTA,What's the matter with him?
224957,L391274,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
224958,L391273,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Hi.
224959,L391244,u6656,m444,PRIEST,"I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen."
224960,L391243,u6649,m444,LORETTA,Alright.
224961,L391242,u6656,m444,PRIEST,"Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life."
224962,L391241,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I know.
224963,L391240,u6656,m444,PRIEST,You should think about this.
224964,L391239,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I know.
224965,L391238,u6656,m444,PRIEST,That's a pretty big sin.
224966,L391237,u6649,m444,LORETTA,I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
224967,L391236,u6656,m444,PRIEST,"Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?"
224968,L391235,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident."
224969,L391234,u6656,m444,PRIEST,What sins have you to confess?
224970,L391233,u6649,m444,LORETTA,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession."
224971,L391304,u6650,m444,LUCY,Did you see the moon last night?
224972,L391303,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,I will. But I must find the right moment.
224973,L391302,u6650,m444,LUCY,Talk to him.
224974,L391301,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
224975,L391300,u6650,m444,LUCY,Don't make yourself sick.
224976,L391297,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,"If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick."
224977,L391296,u6650,m444,LUCY,Don't fight.
224978,L390985,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,"Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say."
224979,L390984,u6650,m444,LUCY,He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
224980,L390983,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,I don't know.
224981,L390982,u6650,m444,LUCY,He should pay.
224982,L390981,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
224983,L390980,u6650,m444,LUCY,Don't fight.
224984,L390978,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
224985,L390977,u6650,m444,LUCY,I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
224986,L390976,u6653,m444,OLD MAN,"Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time."
224987,L391535,u6660,m444,ROSE,"Okay, I'll tell her."
224988,L391534,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
224989,L391533,u6660,m444,ROSE,No idea.
224990,L391532,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,You don't know where Loretta is?
224991,L391531,u6660,m444,ROSE,He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
224992,L391512,u6660,m444,ROSE,"No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question."
224993,L391511,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I don't know.
224994,L391510,u6660,m444,ROSE,That's it! That's the reason!
224995,L391509,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
224996,L391508,u6660,m444,ROSE,But why would a man need more than one woman?
224997,L391507,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,"Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman."
224998,L391506,u6660,m444,ROSE,"That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?"
224999,L391505,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Who was that?
225000,L391503,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Yes.
225001,L391502,u6660,m444,ROSE,That's incredible.
225002,L391501,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
225003,L391500,u6660,m444,ROSE,You're kidding?
225004,L391499,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,My mother's recovered.
225005,L391498,u6660,m444,ROSE,"A miracle. Well, that's news."
225006,L391497,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
225007,L391496,u6660,m444,ROSE,What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
225008,L391495,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Maybe I should go?
225009,L391494,u6660,m444,ROSE,Yes.
225010,L391493,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,It's late.
225011,L391492,u6660,m444,ROSE,Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
225012,L391491,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Where is she?
225013,L391490,u6660,m444,ROSE,So.
225014,L391488,u6660,m444,ROSE,She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
225015,L391487,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
225016,L391486,u6660,m444,ROSE,Come on in.
225017,L391485,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,I came right from the airport.
225018,L391484,u6660,m444,ROSE,Moving in?
225019,L391635,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
225020,L391634,u6659,m444,RONNY,"You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life."
225021,L391633,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
225022,L391623,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,It was a miracle!
225023,L391622,u6659,m444,RONNY,I'm sure she did.
225024,L391617,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Of course I want to.
225025,L391616,u6659,m444,RONNY,Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
225026,L391615,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Have you come to make peace with me?
225027,L391614,u6659,m444,RONNY,Good.
225028,L391613,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
225029,L391612,u6659,m444,RONNY,Johnny...
225030,L391611,u6652,m444,MR. JOHNNY,Loretta...
225031,L391357,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,It's nothing!
225032,L391356,u6654,m444,PERRY,"Thanks, comrade."
225033,L391351,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,Absolutely!
225034,L391350,u6654,m444,PERRY,"Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?"
225035,L390852,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,"She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor."
225036,L390851,u6654,m444,PERRY,What happened?
225037,L390850,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,"When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips."
225038,L390807,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,I am alone in the world.
225039,L390806,u6654,m444,PERRY,Do you have a girlfriend?
225040,L390805,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,Sure!
225041,L390804,u6654,m444,PERRY,May I presume to ask you a question?
225042,L390803,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,Definitely!
225043,L390802,u6654,m444,PERRY,Can I get another one of these?
225044,L390794,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,But absolutely!
225045,L390793,u6654,m444,PERRY,"Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?"
225046,L390792,u6662,m444,SHY WAITER,Yes?
225047,L391441,u6660,m444,ROSE,Good night.
225048,L391440,u6654,m444,PERRY,I'm freezing
225049,L391439,u6660,m444,ROSE,Sure.
225050,L391438,u6654,m444,PERRY,"Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?"
225051,L391437,u6660,m444,ROSE,Good night.
225052,L391436,u6654,m444,PERRY,I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
225053,L391435,u6660,m444,ROSE,I'm too old for you.
225054,L391434,u6654,m444,PERRY,We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
225055,L391433,u6660,m444,ROSE,You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
225056,L391432,u6654,m444,PERRY,I'm a little cold.
225057,L391431,u6660,m444,ROSE,No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
225058,L391430,u6654,m444,PERRY,People home.
225059,L391429,u6660,m444,ROSE,No.
225060,L391428,u6654,m444,PERRY,I guess you can't invite me in?
225061,L391427,u6660,m444,ROSE,Yes.
225062,L391426,u6654,m444,PERRY,Temperature's dropping.
225063,L391393,u6660,m444,ROSE,Yes.
225064,L391392,u6654,m444,PERRY,You knew that man?
225065,L391391,u6660,m444,ROSE,Sure.
225066,L391390,u6654,m444,PERRY,May I walk with you a ways?
225067,L391381,u6660,m444,ROSE,What you don't know about women is a lot.
225068,L391380,u6654,m444,PERRY,"I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect."
225069,L391379,u6654,m444,PERRY,Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
225070,L391378,u6660,m444,ROSE,I think it's because they fear death.
225071,L391377,u6654,m444,PERRY,Nerves.
225072,L391376,u6660,m444,ROSE,Why do men chase women?
225073,L391375,u6654,m444,PERRY,Go ahead.
225074,L391374,u6660,m444,ROSE,I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
225075,L391373,u6654,m444,PERRY,Then why are you eating alone?
225076,L391372,u6660,m444,ROSE,I'm a housewife.
225077,L391371,u6654,m444,PERRY,I'll remember that. What do you do?
225078,L391370,u6660,m444,ROSE,Don't shit where you eat.
225079,L391369,u6654,m444,PERRY,Yes.
225080,L391368,u6660,m444,ROSE,There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
225081,L391367,u6654,m444,PERRY,Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
225082,L391366,u6660,m444,ROSE,That woman was a student of yours?
225083,L391365,u6654,m444,PERRY,I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
225084,L391364,u6660,m444,ROSE,What do you do?
225085,L391363,u6654,m444,PERRY,"Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that."
225086,L391362,u6654,m444,PERRY,Are you sure?
225087,L391361,u6660,m444,ROSE,Will you join me for dinner?
225088,L391360,u6654,m444,PERRY,Sorry. That was rude.
225089,L391359,u6660,m444,ROSE,None of your business.
225090,L391358,u6654,m444,PERRY,Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
225091,L391355,u6660,m444,ROSE,She was just too young for you.
225092,L391354,u6654,m444,PERRY,My lady friend has a personality disorder.
225093,L391353,u6660,m444,ROSE,I'm not disturbed. By you.
225094,L391352,u6654,m444,PERRY,I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
225095,L391425,u6655,m444,PERRY'S VOICE,Well. That explains it.
225096,L391424,u6661,m444,ROSE'S VOICE,He's a plumber.
225097,L391423,u6655,m444,PERRY'S VOICE,I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
225098,L391422,u6661,m444,ROSE'S VOICE,It's a house.
225099,L391421,u6655,m444,PERRY'S VOICE,"My God, it's a mansion!"
225100,L391420,u6661,m444,ROSE'S VOICE,Yes.
225101,L391419,u6655,m444,PERRY'S VOICE,You mean the whole house?
225102,L391418,u6661,m444,ROSE'S VOICE,That's my house.
225103,L391597,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
225104,L391596,u6658,m444,RITA,"We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag."
225105,L391595,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,I knew she had it.
225106,L391594,u6658,m444,RITA,She's got it.
225107,L391285,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,Oh. Right.
225108,L391284,u6658,m444,RITA,"What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo."
225109,L391277,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,You see that moon last night?
225110,L391276,u6658,m444,RITA,You got me.
225111,L391272,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
225112,L391271,u6658,m444,RITA,"Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?"
225113,L391270,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,"So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around."
225114,L391269,u6658,m444,RITA,Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
225115,L391268,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
225116,L391267,u6658,m444,RITA,You were a tiger last night.
225117,L391266,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
225118,L391191,u6658,m444,RITA,"You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old."
225119,L391190,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,I don't know.
225120,L391189,u6658,m444,RITA,What would he be doing down there?
225121,L391188,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,Cosmo.

225123,L391186,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
225124,L391185,u6658,m444,RITA,"What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon."
225125,L391184,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,It's Cosmo's moon.
225126,L391183,u6658,m444,RITA,Oh.

225130,L391159,u6658,m444,RITA,Marriage is happy news.
225131,L391158,u6657,m444,RAYMOND,"Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy."
225132,L392086,u6663,m445,ALL,"Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ..."
225133,L392085,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,"Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?"
225134,L392084,u6663,m445,ALL,"No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond."
225135,L392083,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,Does wood sink in water?
225136,L392082,u6663,m445,ALL,"Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ..."
225137,L392079,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
225138,L392078,u6663,m445,ALL,"I see.  Yes, of course."
225139,L392073,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,"And what do you burn, apart from witches?"
225140,L392072,u6663,m445,ALL,Burn them.
225141,L392071,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
225142,L392070,u6663,m445,ALL,"There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?"
225143,L392069,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
225144,L392068,u6663,m445,ALL,Burn her anyway.
225145,L392062,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,Did you dress her up like this?
225146,L392061,u6663,m445,ALL,"A witch,  a witch,  burn her!"

225148,L392050,u6663,m445,ALL,"She looks like one. Yes, she does."
225149,L392049,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,How do you know she is a witch?
225150,L391905,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,I'm not interested.
225151,L391904,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,Am I right?
225152,L391903,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Please!
225153,L391902,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,"Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?"
225154,L391901,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here."
225155,L391900,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,"It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut."
225156,L391897,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
225157,L391896,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Not at all.  They could be carried.
225158,L391895,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
225159,L391894,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land."
225160,L391893,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,"Well, this is a temperate zone."
225161,L391892,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,What do you mean?
225162,L391891,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
225163,L391890,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Through ... We found them.
225164,L391889,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,Where did you get the coconuts?
225165,L391888,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea."
225166,L391887,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
225167,L391886,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,...What?
225168,L391885,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,You're using coconuts!
225169,L391884,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Yes!
225170,L391883,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,What?  Ridden on a horse?
225171,L391882,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master."
225172,L391881,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,Get away!
225173,L391880,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!"
225174,L391879,u6686,m445,SOLDIER,Halt!  Who goes there?
225175,L392283,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
225176,L392282,u6687,m445,SOOTHSAYER,Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
225177,L392281,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
225178,L392280,u6687,m445,SOOTHSAYER,There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
225179,L392279,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
225180,L392278,u6687,m445,SOOTHSAYER,He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
225181,L392277,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
225182,L391991,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony."
225183,L391990,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,"Well, how did you become king, then?"
225184,L391989,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,You don't vote for kings.
225185,L391988,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,"Well, I didn't vote for you."
225186,L391987,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,I am your king!
225187,L391986,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,"Order, eh -- who does he think he is?"
225188,L391977,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,What?
225189,L391976,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,We don't have a lord.
225190,L391975,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"Well, who is your lord?"
225191,L391974,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,No one live there.
225192,L391973,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?"
225193,L391968,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,All of us are ... we are all Britons.
225194,L391967,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,Who are the Britons?

225196,L391965,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,King of the WHO?
225197,L391964,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?"
225198,L391963,u6680,m445,OLD WOMAN,Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
225199,L392526,u6688,m445,TALL KNIGHT,"No, no ... not ""is""!"
225200,L392525,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"What, ""is""?"
225201,L392524,u6688,m445,TALL KNIGHT,You said it again!
225202,L392523,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?"
225203,L392522,u6688,m445,TALL KNIGHT,I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
225204,L392521,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,What word?
225205,L392518,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
225206,L392517,u6688,m445,TALL KNIGHT,"Oh, please!"

225215,L392308,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Of course.
225216,L392307,u6688,m445,TALL KNIGHT,One that looks nice.
225217,L392306,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery."

225312,L392107,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes."
225313,L392106,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,"And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped."

225364,L391995,u6671,m445,DENNIS,"I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!"
225365,L391994,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Shut up!
225366,L391993,u6671,m445,DENNIS,You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

225368,L391984,u6671,m445,DENNIS,... but a two-thirds majority ...
225369,L391983,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Be quiet!
225370,L391982,u6671,m445,DENNIS,... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
225371,L391981,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"Yes, I see."
225372,L391980,u6671,m445,DENNIS,... But all the decision of that officer ...
225373,L391979,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Yes.

225375,L391962,u6671,m445,DENNIS,"Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ..."
225376,L391961,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Well ... I AM king.
225377,L391960,u6671,m445,DENNIS,What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...

225379,L391958,u6671,m445,DENNIS,"You didn't bother to find out, did you?"
225380,L391957,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,I didn't know you were called Dennis.
225381,L391956,u6671,m445,DENNIS,"Well you could say: ""Dennis"""
225382,L391955,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,":Well - I can't just say:  ""Hey, Man!'"

225392,L392125,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"Yes, Lord."
225393,L392124,u6676,m445,GOD,"Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of"
225394,L392123,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,"I'm averting my eyes, Lord."
225395,L392122,u6676,m445,GOD,And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
225396,L392121,u6664,m445,ARTHUR,Sorry ...
225397,L392090,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,And therefore?

225404,L392060,u6674,m445,FIRST VILLAGER,And the hat.  But she is a witch.
225405,L392059,u6665,m445,BEDEVERE,The nose?
225406,L392058,u6674,m445,FIRST VILLAGER,"... Well, we did do the nose."

225476,L392426,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,Gosh - Is he all right?
225477,L392425,u6672,m445,FATHER,Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
225478,L392424,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,"Oh dear, I didn't really mean to..."
225479,L392421,u6672,m445,FATHER,I can understand that.
225480,L392420,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,"Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady."
225481,L392419,u6672,m445,FATHER,You killed eight wedding guests in all!
225482,L392417,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,"Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ..."
225483,L392416,u6672,m445,FATHER,They cost fifty pounds each!
225484,L392415,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
225485,L392414,u6672,m445,FATHER,Did you kill all those guards?
225486,L392458,u6683,m445,PRINCE,Well ... I'll tell you ...
225487,L392457,u6672,m445,FATHER,How?
225488,L392456,u6683,m445,PRINCE,I was saved at the last minute.
225489,L392455,u6672,m445,FATHER,You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
225490,L392423,u6672,m445,FATHER,Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
225491,L392422,u6683,m445,PRINCE,"Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!"
225492,L392410,u6672,m445,FATHER,Not you.
225493,L392409,u6683,m445,PRINCE,I'm ... your son ...
225494,L392408,u6672,m445,FATHER,Who are you?
225495,L392377,u6672,m445,FATHER,"Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!"
225496,L392376,u6683,m445,PRINCE,"But, Father."
225497,L392330,u6683,m445,PRINCE,I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
225498,L392329,u6672,m445,FATHER,Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
225499,L392328,u6683,m445,PRINCE,But I don't like her.
225500,L392327,u6672,m445,FATHER,"Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get."
225501,L392326,u6683,m445,PRINCE,Herbert.
225502,L392325,u6672,m445,FATHER,"Listen, Alice ..."
225503,L392324,u6683,m445,PRINCE,I don't want land.
225504,L392323,u6672,m445,FATHER,You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
225505,L392322,u6683,m445,PRINCE,I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
225506,L392321,u6672,m445,FATHER,Rather what?
225507,L392320,u6683,m445,PRINCE,"But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ..."
225508,L392319,u6672,m445,FATHER,"Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island."
225509,L392318,u6683,m445,PRINCE,"But, Father, I don't really want any of that."
225510,L392317,u6672,m445,FATHER,"Father, lad."
225511,L392316,u6683,m445,PRINCE,"But, Mother ..."
225512,L392315,u6672,m445,FATHER,"No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad."
225513,L392314,u6683,m445,PRINCE,What - the curtains?
225514,L392313,u6672,m445,FATHER,"One day, lad, all this will be yours ..."
225515,L392375,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,"Oh, I see,  Right."
225516,L392374,u6672,m445,FATHER,"No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back."
225517,L392373,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,We're coming with you.
225518,L392372,u6672,m445,FATHER,Where are you going?
225519,L392369,u6672,m445,FATHER,Is that clear?
225520,L392368,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,"Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ..."
225521,L392367,u6672,m445,FATHER,Yes ...  make sure ...
225522,L392366,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,The Prince ... ?
225523,L392365,u6672,m445,FATHER,Make sure he doesn't leave.
225524,L392364,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,What?
225525,L392363,u6672,m445,FATHER,And make sure he doesn't leave.
225526,L392362,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
225527,L392361,u6672,m445,FATHER,Right.
225528,L392358,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,Just you ...
225529,L392357,u6672,m445,FATHER,"No, not anyone else - just me."
225530,L392356,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,"Until you, or anyone else ..."
225531,L392355,u6672,m445,FATHER,No ... just keep him in here.
225532,L392354,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,"Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him."
225533,L392353,u6672,m445,FATHER,No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
225534,L392352,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,"Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?"
225535,L392349,u6672,m445,FATHER,"Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room."
225536,L392348,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,If we ... er ...
225537,L392347,u6672,m445,FATHER,Yes?
225538,L392346,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,Er ... if ... we ... er ...
225539,L392344,u6672,m445,FATHER,Got it?
225540,L392343,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,Leaving the room ... yes.
225541,L392342,u6672,m445,FATHER,Leaving the room.
225542,L392341,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,"We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room."
225543,L392338,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,... and you'll come and get him.
225544,L392337,u6672,m445,FATHER,No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
225545,L392334,u6672,m445,FATHER,No.  Until I come and get him.
225546,L392333,u6673,m445,FIRST GUARD,Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
225547,L392332,u6672,m445,FATHER,Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
225548,L392220,u6690,m445,ZOOT,You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
225549,L392219,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,"No, It's nothing!"
225550,L392218,u6690,m445,ZOOT,We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
225551,L392217,u6690,m445,ZOOT,"I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear...."
225552,L392216,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,Well ...
225553,L392214,u6690,m445,ZOOT,Sir Galahad!!

225556,L392211,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
225557,L392210,u6690,m445,ZOOT,"What is your name, handsome knight?"
225558,L392209,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,"Well, look er, I ..."
225559,L392204,u6690,m445,ZOOT,The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
225560,L392203,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
225561,L392202,u6690,m445,ZOOT,"Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!"
225562,L392201,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,The Castle Anthrax?
225563,L392629,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,Ector.
225564,L392628,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,Sir Gawain.
225565,L392274,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,"No, I'm not."
225566,L392273,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,... I Bet you're gay.
225567,L392272,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,No.  It's unhealthy.
225568,L392271,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,"Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?"
225569,L392270,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,"No, no, we must find the Grail."
225570,L392269,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,"Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can."
225571,L392268,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,It's too perilous.
225572,L392267,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,"Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?"
225573,L392266,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,"You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril."
225574,L392265,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,I don't think I was.
225575,L392264,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
225576,L392258,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,"No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!"
225577,L392257,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,"Come Sir Galahad, quickly!"
225578,L392253,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,Look - I'm fine!

225581,L392248,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,You are in great peril.
225582,L392247,u6675,m445,GALAHAD,Why?
225583,L392246,u6678,m445,LAUNCELOT,Quick!

225618,L392512,u6688,m445,TALL KNIGHT,"When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle."

225636,L392170,u6684,m445,ROBIN,"Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot."
225637,L396906,u6696,m446,BROWN,"She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?"
225638,L396905,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her."
225639,L396904,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
225640,L396903,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,It's what the maids are for.
225641,L396902,u6696,m446,BROWN,I can't move to tidy.
225642,L396901,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,The place is a mess.
225643,L396900,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
225644,L396899,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,You should have someone look after you.
225645,L396898,u6696,m446,BROWN,What do you take me for?
225646,L396897,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,Be careful who sees it.
225647,L396896,u6696,m446,BROWN,It's a diary.
225648,L396895,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,What's this?
225649,L396815,u6696,m446,BROWN,Get out.  Out!

225654,L396809,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you."
225655,L396808,u6696,m446,BROWN,You know nothing about her!
225656,L396807,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know."
225657,L396806,u6696,m446,BROWN,You watch your tongue.
225658,L396805,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants."
225659,L396804,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Oh, I'm much more than that."
225660,L396803,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant."
225661,L396802,u6696,m446,BROWN,"I can't let her down now, Archie."
225662,L396801,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,She'll get over it.
225663,L396800,u6696,m446,BROWN,She'll be worried about me.
225664,L396799,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
225665,L396798,u6696,m446,BROWN,I've got my duties to attend to.
225666,L396797,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"You've got three broken ribs, man!"
225667,L396796,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm getting dressed.
225668,L396795,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,What are you doing?!
225669,L396794,u6696,m446,BROWN,She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
225670,L396793,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
225671,L396792,u6696,m446,BROWN,And she sent no word down?
225672,L396564,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
225673,L396563,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful."
225674,L396562,u6696,m446,BROWN,But I'm the only one she trusts.
225675,L396561,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
225676,L396560,u6696,m446,BROWN,"The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight."
225677,L396559,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"John, it's not your problem what she eats."
225678,L396558,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Aye, but will they?"
225679,L396557,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
225680,L396556,u6696,m446,BROWN,"One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys."
225681,L396455,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy."
225682,L396454,u6696,m446,BROWN,Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
225683,L396453,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,The good-looking one.
225684,L396452,u6696,m446,BROWN,Which one of us is she flirting with?
225685,L396451,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
225686,L396450,u6696,m446,BROWN,"I'm not sure I do, Archie."
225687,L396449,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,You know what I mean.
225688,L396448,u6696,m446,BROWN,What?
225689,L396447,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"Come on, man.  There's love and there's ..."
225690,L396446,u6696,m446,BROWN,She loved him.
225691,L396445,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?"
225692,L396444,u6696,m446,BROWN,It's only grief makes her like she is.
225693,L396443,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,She's hardly a full hamper herself.
225694,L396442,u6696,m446,BROWN,"If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones."
225695,L396441,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,It's better than shovelling horse shit.
225696,L396440,u6696,m446,BROWN,Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
225697,L396439,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,That's pretty good for a ghillie.
225698,L396438,u6696,m446,BROWN,Sixty.
225699,L396437,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,How about yourself?
225700,L396436,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Not bad, not bad."
225701,L396435,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,Seventy a year.
225702,L396434,u6696,m446,BROWN,How much?
225703,L396433,u6696,m446,BROWN,I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
225704,L396432,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
225705,L396431,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,Not down south you don't.
225706,L396430,u6696,m446,BROWN,"I speak as I find, Archie."
225707,L396429,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
225708,L396428,u6696,m446,BROWN,"I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake."
225709,L396427,u6691,m446,ARCHIE,"So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do."
225710,L396426,u6696,m446,BROWN,So?
225711,L396886,u6696,m446,BROWN,Kitchen and lower house.
225712,L396885,u6692,m446,ASSISTANT DRESSER,"Checked and locked, sir."
225713,L396884,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Louder, girl!"
225714,L396883,u6692,m446,ASSISTANT DRESSER,"Checked and locked, sir."
225715,L396511,u6696,m446,BROWN,"You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?"
225716,L396510,u6692,m446,ASSISTANT DRESSER,I hope to go up next year.
225717,L396509,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?"
225718,L396508,u6692,m446,ASSISTANT DRESSER,"Mary Taylor, sir."
225719,L396507,u6696,m446,BROWN,What's your name?
225720,L396781,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Are you all right, Barney?"
225721,L396780,u6693,m446,BARNEY,Yeah.
225722,L396779,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?"
225723,L396778,u6693,m446,BARNEY,Yeah.
225724,L396777,u6696,m446,BROWN,Good man.  And is she all right?
225725,L396776,u6693,m446,BARNEY,"Yeah, yeah, I did."
225726,L396775,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it."
225727,L396774,u6696,m446,BROWN,"It's cold out there tonight, Barney."
225728,L396773,u6693,m446,BARNEY,"Mr Brown, sir --"
225729,L396772,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Hey, Barney."
225730,L396659,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Quite.
225731,L396658,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni."
225732,L396657,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,I'm flattered you think so.
225733,L396656,u6694,m446,BERTIE,I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
225734,L396655,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,A situation?
225735,L396654,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops."
225736,L396653,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,I see.
225737,L396652,u6694,m446,BERTIE,I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
225738,L396651,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Of course.
225739,L396650,u6694,m446,BERTIE,My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
225740,L396649,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"I take no account of gossip, Your Highness."
225741,L396648,u6694,m446,BERTIE,No doubt you've heard the rumors.
225742,L396647,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,I don't think I've had that pleasure.
225743,L396646,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
225744,L396645,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
225745,L396644,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
225746,L396758,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Out of my way!
225747,L396757,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion."
225748,L396756,u6694,m446,BERTIE,The future King!
225749,L396755,u6696,m446,BROWN,Whom you address.
225750,L396754,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"Do you know who you address, sir?"
225751,L396753,u6696,m446,BROWN,"I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?"
225752,L396752,u6694,m446,BERTIE,What did you say?
225753,L396751,u6696,m446,BROWN,Are you deaf as well as stupid?
225754,L396750,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
225755,L396749,u6696,m446,BROWN,She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
225756,L396748,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Convey her a message.
225757,L396747,u6696,m446,BROWN,She's busy.
225758,L396746,u6694,m446,BERTIE,I wish to see my mother.
225759,L396606,u6694,m446,BERTIE,I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
225760,L396605,u6696,m446,BROWN,It's the Queen's decision.
225761,L396604,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant."
225762,L396603,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,And that is my last word on the matter.
225763,L396602,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Mama...
225764,L396601,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
225765,L396600,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --"
225766,L396599,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,It is quite late enough.
225767,L396598,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?"
225768,L396597,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged."
225769,L396596,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
225770,L396536,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
225771,L396535,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--"
225772,L396534,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
225773,L396533,u6694,m446,BERTIE,Mother....
225774,L396526,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!"
225775,L396525,u6694,m446,BERTIE,It's so infernally cold in here.
225776,L396524,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?"
225777,L396523,u6694,m446,BERTIE,"I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?"
225778,L396522,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Gesture?
225779,L396888,u6696,m446,BROWN,Back and upper corridors.
225780,L396887,u6695,m446,BERTIE'S VALET,"Checked and locked, sir."
225781,L396690,u6696,m446,BROWN,You'll talk when I'm finished!
225782,L396689,u6695,m446,BERTIE'S VALET,We --
225783,L396688,u6696,m446,BROWN,"What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!"
225784,L396504,u6696,m446,BROWN,"That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood."
225785,L396503,u6695,m446,BERTIE'S VALET,The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
225786,L396502,u6696,m446,BROWN,My own.
225787,L396501,u6695,m446,BERTIE'S VALET,By whose authority?
225788,L396500,u6696,m446,BROWN,Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
225789,L396499,u6695,m446,BERTIE'S VALET,"Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there."
225790,L396996,u6696,m446,BROWN,I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
225791,L396995,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
225792,L396702,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you."
225793,L396701,u6696,m446,BROWN,Nobody has any rights over me.
225794,L396700,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you."
225795,L396699,u6696,m446,BROWN,This is a slur on her good name.
225796,L396698,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
225797,L396697,u6696,m446,BROWN,Don't think I can't persuade her.
225798,L396696,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
225799,L396695,u6696,m446,BROWN,"If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked."
225800,L396593,u6696,m446,BROWN,It can wait.  Anything else?
225801,L396592,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,There are important papers from --
225802,L396591,u6696,m446,BROWN,That can wait till the weekend.
225803,L396590,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
225804,L396589,u6696,m446,BROWN,She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
225805,L396478,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"Yes, it most certainly is!"
225806,L396477,u6696,m446,BROWN,Is that the Queen's request?
225807,L396476,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Go inside at once.
225808,L396475,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!"
225809,L396474,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
225810,L396473,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,I beg your pardon?
225811,L396472,u6696,m446,BROWN,No.
225812,L396471,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
225813,L396470,u6696,m446,BROWN,I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
225814,L396469,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
225815,L396468,u6696,m446,BROWN,Awaiting my orders.
225816,L396403,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Yes.  I do.
225817,L396402,u6696,m446,BROWN,Do you?
225818,L396401,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf."
225819,L396400,u6696,m446,BROWN,I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
225820,L396399,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
225821,L396398,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Aye, do."
225822,L396397,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
225823,L396396,u6696,m446,BROWN,That's not good enough.
225824,L396395,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
225825,L396394,u6696,m446,BROWN,I need a man who knows where I am.
225826,L396393,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Her Highness' Equerry.
225827,L396392,u6696,m446,BROWN,Who'll bring it to me?
225828,L396391,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,You'll be sent a message.
225829,L396390,u6696,m446,BROWN,How will I know what she requires?
225830,L396389,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,I'm sorry?
225831,L396388,u6696,m446,BROWN,How will I know?
225832,L396387,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires."
225833,L396956,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
225834,L396955,u6696,m446,BROWN,She'll think I betrayed her.
225835,L396954,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"In time, she will."
225836,L396953,u6696,m446,BROWN,She'll never understand it.
225837,L396952,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"For once in my life, I am not the issue."
225838,L396951,u6696,m446,BROWN,I promised to protect her from people like you.
225839,L396950,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,No love.
225840,L396949,u6696,m446,BROWN,No loyalty.
225841,L396948,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,The greasy pole.
225842,L396947,u6696,m446,BROWN,Too busy looking after themselves.
225843,L396946,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,They aren't as watchful as you.
225844,L396945,u6696,m446,BROWN,"The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it."
225845,L396944,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,See what?
225846,L396943,u6696,m446,BROWN,They don't see it.
225847,L396942,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"She trusts you, John."
225848,L396941,u6696,m446,BROWN,Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
225849,L396940,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense."
225850,L396939,u6696,m446,BROWN,So...?
225851,L396938,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here."
225852,L396937,u6696,m446,BROWN,Why do you think I keep her here?
225853,L396936,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
225854,L396934,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,No other aspiration?
225855,L396933,u6696,m446,BROWN,I said.  I serve the Queen.
225856,L396932,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,But yourself?  What about John Brown?
225857,L396931,u6696,m446,BROWN,Aye.
225858,L396930,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,For Her Majesty.
225859,L396929,u6696,m446,BROWN,I do what I do.
225860,L396928,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work."
225861,L396927,u6696,m446,BROWN,Why?
225862,L396926,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Then I envy yo.
225863,L396925,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Maybe, once."
225864,L396924,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Was there never ambition?
225865,L396923,u6696,m446,BROWN,"What I do, I do for my Queen."
225866,L396922,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Surely --
225867,L396921,u6696,m446,BROWN,I wouldn't know.
225868,L396920,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
225869,L396918,u6696,m446,BROWN,This is the top.
225870,L396917,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Oh.
225871,L396916,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm not married.
225872,L396915,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out."
225873,L396914,u6696,m446,BROWN,It's nothing.
225874,L396913,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,You're injured.
225875,L396912,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm fine.
225876,L396911,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting."
225877,L396910,u6696,m446,BROWN,I don't think about it.
225878,L396909,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views."
225879,L396908,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
225880,L396907,u6696,m446,BROWN,You sent for me.
225881,L396879,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Quite.
225882,L396878,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone."
225883,L396876,u6696,m446,BROWN,"If you hunt, you kill."
225884,L396875,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"To shoot perhaps, but not to kill."
225885,L396874,u6696,m446,BROWN,Dare say you can be taught.
225886,L396873,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Occasionally.
225887,L396872,u6696,m446,BROWN,Do you hunt?
225888,L396871,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,I am a blank sheet.
225889,L396870,u6696,m446,BROWN,What do you know about the Highlands?
225890,L396869,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
225891,L396868,u6696,m446,BROWN,What brings you here?
225892,L397018,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Yes.  Yes it was.
225893,L397017,u6696,m446,BROWN,Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
225894,L397016,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
225895,L396972,u6696,m446,BROWN,Because I have to!
225896,L396971,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Then why send me back to them?!
225897,L396970,u6696,m446,BROWN,"-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!"
225898,L396969,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
225899,L396968,u6696,m446,BROWN,"For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!"
225900,L396967,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
225901,L396966,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm breaking no promises!
225902,L396965,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
225903,L396964,u6696,m446,BROWN,Have I ever let you down before--?
225904,L396963,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --"
225905,L396962,u6696,m446,BROWN,"If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do."
225906,L396961,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
225907,L396847,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please."
225908,L396846,u6696,m446,BROWN,I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
225909,L396845,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I do not accept.
225910,L396844,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign."
225911,L396843,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Yes?
225912,L396842,u6696,m446,BROWN,Ma'am?
225913,L396841,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Yes, ma'am."
225914,L396840,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Has someone seen to those bruises?
225915,L396839,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Yes, ma'am."
225916,L396838,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I was told you were in a fight.
225917,L396837,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Yes, ma'am?"
225918,L396836,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,John?
225919,L396769,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
225920,L396768,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure."
225921,L396767,u6696,m446,BROWN,Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
225922,L396766,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"Am I not safe enough with you, John?"
225923,L396765,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next."
225924,L396764,u6696,m446,BROWN,I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
225925,L396763,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Must they always follow us?
225926,L396680,u6696,m446,BROWN,I heard something.
225927,L396679,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"What is it, John?  John?"
225928,L396671,u6696,m446,BROWN,Aye.
225929,L396670,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,To keep out the cold.
225930,L396669,u6696,m446,BROWN,We took a nip of whiskey.
225931,L396615,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Ah, well..."
225932,L396614,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John."
225933,L396613,u6696,m446,BROWN,They're ready now.
225934,L396585,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson."
225935,L396584,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you."
225936,L396583,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
225937,L396582,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you."
225938,L396581,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
225939,L396580,u6696,m446,BROWN,"I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming."
225940,L396579,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject."
225941,L396578,u6696,m446,BROWN,That doesn't make him an expert.
225942,L396577,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
225943,L396576,u6696,m446,BROWN,What does he know about the Highlands?
225944,L396575,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
225945,L396574,u6696,m446,BROWN,Who by?
225946,L396573,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I am told so.
225947,L396572,u6696,m446,BROWN,Are they worth reading?
225948,L396571,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"I am thinking of publishing my ""Highland Journals."""
225949,L396570,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
225950,L396569,u6696,m446,BROWN,Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
225951,L396568,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"Those, over there, there."
225952,L396567,u6696,m446,BROWN,What?
225953,L396566,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,What are those?
225954,L396495,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Yes.
225955,L396494,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Aye, ma'am."
225956,L396493,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?"
225957,L396492,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
225958,L396491,u6696,m446,BROWN,"If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two."
225959,L396489,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"He thought so, yes."
225960,L396488,u6696,m446,BROWN,"It's a fine spot, ma'am."
225961,L396487,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
225962,L396486,u6696,m446,BROWN,And I intend to be there when she's ready.
225963,L396485,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
225964,L396484,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her."
225965,L396483,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Then why do you persist in doing it?
225966,L396482,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Yes, ma'am."
225967,L396481,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
225968,L396480,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Yes, ma'am."
225969,L396479,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Mr Brown.
225970,L396422,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Yes, ma'am."
225971,L396421,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Yes.  That will be company for you.
225972,L396420,u6696,m446,BROWN,Archie.
225973,L396419,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name."
225974,L396418,u6696,m446,BROWN,"I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters."
225975,L396417,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much."
225976,L396416,u6696,m446,BROWN,I'm glad of it.
225977,L396415,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
225978,L396414,u6696,m446,BROWN,"She's well, too."
225979,L396413,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,And the pony?
225980,L396412,u6696,m446,BROWN,I am.
225981,L396411,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,You are well?
225982,L396410,u6696,m446,BROWN,"Aye, ma'am."
225983,L396409,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,You are here safely.
225984,L396408,u6696,m446,BROWN,Ma'am.
225985,L396407,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Mr Brown.
225986,L396733,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Oh, several things."
225987,L396732,u6697,m446,DEAN WELLSELLY,What can we do?
225988,L396725,u6697,m446,DEAN WELLSELLY,I beg your pardon?
225989,L396724,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?"
225990,L396723,u6697,m446,DEAN WELLSELLY,I came as quickly as I could.
225991,L396722,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time."
225992,L396721,u6697,m446,DEAN WELLSELLY,"Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late."
225993,L396867,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
225994,L396866,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Yes.
225995,L396865,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,This is my good John Brown.
225996,L396863,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"No, ma'am."
225997,L396862,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
225998,L396861,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it."
225999,L396860,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief."
226000,L396859,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
226001,L396858,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Is that not enough?
226002,L396857,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful."
226003,L396856,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Then they may read about me.
226004,L396854,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli."
226005,L396853,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens."
226006,L396720,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"I was trying to imagine ""rather upset."""
226007,L396719,u6703,m446,STANLEY,"The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling."
226008,L396718,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,What's her excuse this time?
226009,L396717,u6703,m446,STANLEY,She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
226010,L396716,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out."
226011,L396715,u6703,m446,STANLEY,It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
226012,L396714,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Mrs Brown.
226013,L396713,u6703,m446,STANLEY,Who?
226014,L396712,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
226015,L396711,u6703,m446,STANLEY,You can't know that for sure.
226016,L396710,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,We're going to lose.
226017,L396662,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,To know when he'll be king.
226018,L396661,u6703,m446,STANLEY,What did he want?
226019,L396628,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,I hope he got his mother's permission.
226020,L396627,u6703,m446,STANLEY,I see the Prince of Wales is here.
226021,L396554,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,We'll see which way the wind blows.
226022,L396553,u6703,m446,STANLEY,So?
226023,L396552,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close."
226024,L396551,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion."
226025,L396550,u6703,m446,STANLEY,"Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--"
226026,L396549,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,"The question is, do we need her?"
226027,L396548,u6703,m446,STANLEY,"Well, both."
226028,L396547,u6698,m446,DISRAELI,The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
226029,L396546,u6703,m446,STANLEY,Should we take it seriously?
226030,L397035,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"No, indeed."
226031,L397034,u6699,m446,JENNER,"Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry."
226032,L397033,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
226033,L397032,u6699,m446,JENNER,Where did you find it by the way?
226034,L397031,u6699,m446,JENNER,Of course.
226035,L397030,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
226036,L397029,u6699,m446,JENNER,Yes.
226037,L397028,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
226038,L397027,u6699,m446,JENNER,Dear oh dear.
226039,L397026,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
226040,L397025,u6699,m446,JENNER,"A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments."
226041,L397024,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"Not too protracted, I hope."
226042,L397023,u6699,m446,JENNER,Erysipelas.
226043,L396675,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"No, she wasn't."
226044,L396674,u6699,m446,JENNER,"A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you."
226045,L396375,u6699,m446,JENNER,Excellent!
226046,L396374,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"A fine choice, sir."
226047,L396988,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,How ill is he?
226048,L396987,u6699,m446,JENNER,"I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves."
226049,L396986,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Why was I not informed?
226050,L396985,u6699,m446,JENNER,"The same, your Majesty."
226051,L396984,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son."
226052,L396532,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
226053,L396531,u6699,m446,JENNER,"Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--"
226054,L396530,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Why am I being lectured in this way?!
226055,L396529,u6699,m446,JENNER,"Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity..."
226056,L396528,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Cold is good!
226057,L396527,u6699,m446,JENNER,"I'm sorry, ma'am?"
226058,L396383,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Whom?
226059,L396382,u6699,m446,JENNER,"We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am."
226060,L397015,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Why was I not told earlier?
226061,L397014,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,"A few days, ma'am."
226062,L397013,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,How long has he been this sick?
226063,L396790,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,"I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink."
226064,L396789,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Has he been hurt?
226065,L396788,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,I understand he was in a fight.
226066,L396787,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Unwell?
226067,L396786,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,"I believe he is unwell, ma'am."
226068,L396785,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Why?
226069,L396784,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
226070,L396783,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Well?
226071,L396462,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,"I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe."
226072,L396461,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
226073,L396460,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
226074,L396459,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,What is he doing there?
226075,L396458,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,"It's Mr Brown, ma'am."
226076,L396381,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,"Yes, ma'am."
226077,L396380,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Just them?
226078,L396379,u6700,m446,LADY ELY,"The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am."
226079,L396833,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Ma'am.
226080,L396832,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?"
226081,L396831,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Ma'am?
226082,L396826,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
226083,L396825,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,What do they want?
226084,L396824,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
226085,L396823,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
226086,L396822,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,From whom?
226087,L396821,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"I have a letter, ma'am."
226088,L396820,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,What is it?
226089,L396819,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,There is one other matter.
226090,L396744,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
226091,L396743,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Your Majesty --
226092,L396742,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!"
226093,L396741,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself."
226094,L396740,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Why not?
226095,L396739,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,I have no idea.
226096,L396738,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Who told them that?
226097,L396736,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Read it!
226098,L396735,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,Again?
226099,L396734,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Read it.
226100,L396668,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,And now I am back.
226101,L396667,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,We were expecting you to return by six.
226102,L396666,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
226103,L396517,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,No.  I shall be out walking.
226104,L396516,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government."
226105,L396515,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Why?
226106,L396514,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience."
226107,L396466,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"Of course, at once."
226108,L396465,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Please make sure it does not happen again.
226109,L396464,u6701,m446,PONSONBY,"I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions."
226110,L396463,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding."
226111,L396983,u6702,m446,PRINCESS ALEXANDRA,"He has typhoid fever, ma'am."
226112,L396982,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,What is the matter with him?
226113,L396981,u6702,m446,PRINCESS ALEXANDRA,You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
226114,L396980,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Then why are you not with him?
226115,L396979,u6702,m446,PRINCESS ALEXANDRA,"He is sick, ma'am."
226116,L396978,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Why is he not here?
226117,L396977,u6702,m446,PRINCESS ALEXANDRA,"Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am."
226118,L396976,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,Where is my son?
226119,L396385,u6702,m446,PRINCESS ALEXANDRA,"Yes, ma'am."
226120,L396384,u6704,m446,VICTORIA,"That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite."
226121,L398836,u6705,m447,ALBERT,Sure.
226122,L398835,u6712,m447,NICK,"Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?"
226123,L398834,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"Well, technically ""yes"", but this is only the prototype."
226124,L398833,u6712,m447,NICK,Could you play ARCADE with that?
226125,L398826,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening."
226126,L398825,u6712,m447,NICK,How the hell did you do that?
226127,L398817,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys..."
226128,L398816,u6712,m447,NICK,Just tell me the fucking riddle.
226129,L398815,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"If I tell you, then it's no fun."
226130,L398814,u6712,m447,NICK,What's the riddle?
226131,L398813,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't..."
226132,L398812,u6712,m447,NICK,How do you stop The Screamer?
226133,L398811,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes."
226134,L398808,u6705,m447,ALBERT,It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
226135,L398807,u6712,m447,NICK,What do you mean?
226136,L398804,u6705,m447,ALBERT,Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
226137,L398803,u6712,m447,NICK,Does that thing work?
226138,L398832,u6705,m447,ALBERT,And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
226139,L398831,u6706,m447,ALEX,The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
226140,L398830,u6705,m447,ALBERT,He?
226141,L398829,u6706,m447,ALEX,Maybe he's not dead.
226142,L398828,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important."
226143,L398827,u6706,m447,ALEX,Dead?
226144,L398824,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible."
226145,L398823,u6706,m447,ALEX,But how can it change every time?
226146,L398822,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat."
226147,L398821,u6706,m447,ALEX,How do you do that?
226148,L398820,u6705,m447,ALBERT,Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
226149,L398819,u6706,m447,ALEX,What's the question mark?
226150,L398818,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though."
226151,L398810,u6705,m447,ALBERT,Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
226152,L398809,u6706,m447,ALEX,"We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game..."
226153,L398806,u6705,m447,ALBERT,"Yeah, who isn't."
226154,L398805,u6706,m447,ALEX,We're having some problems with ARCADE...
226155,L398789,u6706,m447,ALEX,There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
226156,L398788,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,Talk to me.
226157,L398787,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,Why don't we take this into my office.
226158,L398786,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford."
226159,L398785,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,"If this is a joke, I'm not laughing."
226160,L398783,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,You don't like it?
226161,L398782,u6706,m447,ALEX,"It's the game, ARCADE."
226162,L398781,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,Now what seems to be the problem?
226163,L398780,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,"Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live."
226164,L398779,u6706,m447,ALEX,How'd you know it was us?
226165,L398778,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,"Nick, Alex, how are we today?"
226166,L398974,u6706,m447,ALEX,"But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth."
226167,L398973,u6713,m447,STILTS,I came from the city on the left.
226168,L398972,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?"
226169,L398683,u6713,m447,STILTS,"Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted..."
226170,L398682,u6706,m447,ALEX,Did you play ARCADE last night?
226171,L398681,u6713,m447,STILTS,What's her problem?
226172,L398680,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that."
226173,L398679,u6713,m447,STILTS,Sick?
226174,L398599,u6713,m447,STILTS,He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
226175,L398598,u6706,m447,ALEX,Has anyone seen Greg?
226176,L398507,u6713,m447,STILTS,What the hell does that mean?
226177,L398506,u6706,m447,ALEX,"He thinks I'm ""sublimating""."
226178,L399033,u6706,m447,ALEX,I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
226179,L399032,u6712,m447,NICK,What is it?
226180,L398942,u6706,m447,ALEX,Never been on a snowboard.
226181,L398941,u6712,m447,NICK,We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
226182,L398940,u6706,m447,ALEX,There never is.
226183,L398939,u6712,m447,NICK,Christ...no time...
226184,L398938,u6712,m447,NICK,I don't want to talk about it.
226185,L398937,u6706,m447,ALEX,"One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?"
226186,L398936,u6712,m447,NICK,So that's what we almost died for?
226187,L398935,u6706,m447,ALEX,We don't have a choice!
226188,L398934,u6712,m447,NICK,We can't reach that!
226189,L398932,u6706,m447,ALEX,Screamer.
226190,L398931,u6712,m447,NICK,What the fuck is that?!
226191,L398929,u6706,m447,ALEX,Look around...
226192,L398928,u6712,m447,NICK,What?!  There's nothing here!
226193,L398927,u6706,m447,ALEX,Our time's up.
226194,L398923,u6706,m447,ALEX,Check your read-out.
226195,L398922,u6712,m447,NICK,Shit...
226196,L398921,u6706,m447,ALEX,There...
226197,L398920,u6712,m447,NICK,"Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies."
226198,L398919,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Yeah, that's what worries me."
226199,L398918,u6712,m447,NICK,And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
226200,L398914,u6712,m447,NICK,"Right, then..."
226201,L398913,u6706,m447,ALEX,The clock's already ticking.
226202,L398911,u6706,m447,ALEX,"The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then..."
226203,L398910,u6712,m447,NICK,Okay.  It's West.
226204,L398908,u6706,m447,ALEX,"You've got the schematics, check."
226205,L398907,u6712,m447,NICK,Which way do you think Level Two is?
226206,L398905,u6706,m447,ALEX,Got it.
226207,L398904,u6712,m447,NICK,I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
226208,L398903,u6712,m447,NICK,That's what I was hoping you'd say.
226209,L398902,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances."
226210,L398901,u6712,m447,NICK,Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
226211,L398900,u6712,m447,NICK,Don't even say it.
226212,L398899,u6706,m447,ALEX,One.  In case...
226213,L398898,u6712,m447,NICK,Okay.  Give us a kiss?
226214,L398897,u6712,m447,NICK,"We're actually inside, aren't we?"
226215,L398896,u6706,m447,ALEX,You feel it?  It's different this time.
226216,L398885,u6712,m447,NICK,I know.  It sucks.
226217,L398884,u6706,m447,ALEX,"I already have a boyfriend, Nick."
226218,L398883,u6712,m447,NICK,I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
226219,L398882,u6706,m447,ALEX,What?
226220,L398881,u6712,m447,NICK,"You don't get it, do you?"
226221,L398879,u6712,m447,NICK,"No.  If you're smart, you run like hell."
226222,L398878,u6706,m447,ALEX,And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
226223,L398877,u6712,m447,NICK,"I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant."
226224,L398876,u6706,m447,ALEX,Yes I am...
226225,L398875,u6712,m447,NICK,"You're not coming, Alex."
226226,L398871,u6706,m447,ALEX,Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
226227,L398870,u6712,m447,NICK,"It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter."
226228,L398869,u6706,m447,ALEX,Put in a quarter.
226229,L398868,u6712,m447,NICK,I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
226230,L398865,u6712,m447,NICK,A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
226231,L398864,u6706,m447,ALEX,What are you looking for?
226232,L398858,u6706,m447,ALEX,You didn't hear me?
226233,L398857,u6712,m447,NICK,Alex...
226234,L398852,u6712,m447,NICK,Yeah.  The Inferno.
226235,L398851,u6706,m447,ALEX,Dante's Inferno.
226236,L398850,u6712,m447,NICK,"I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?"
226237,L398848,u6712,m447,NICK,Everything.
226238,L398847,u6706,m447,ALEX,You got the schematics?
226239,L398846,u6706,m447,ALEX,I can't believe you made it!
226240,L398845,u6712,m447,NICK,Jesus Christ!
226241,L398839,u6712,m447,NICK,"Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible."
226242,L398838,u6706,m447,ALEX,What are you going to do?
226243,L398837,u6712,m447,NICK,"Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?"
226244,L398792,u6712,m447,NICK,"We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?"
226245,L398791,u6706,m447,ALEX,No I'm not...
226246,L398790,u6712,m447,NICK,"What Alex is trying to say is that it ""seems"" like it's alive."
226247,L398777,u6712,m447,NICK,Drives 'em crazy every time.
226248,L398776,u6706,m447,ALEX,Virgin sacrifices?
226249,L398766,u6706,m447,ALEX,I was afraid you'd say that.
226250,L398765,u6712,m447,NICK,"You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game."
226251,L398764,u6706,m447,ALEX,And beat it at it's own game.
226252,L398763,u6712,m447,NICK,You mean we learn the rules...
226253,L398762,u6706,m447,ALEX,"They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?."
226254,L398761,u6712,m447,NICK,What?
226255,L398760,u6706,m447,ALEX,SLIP-STREAM.
226256,L398759,u6712,m447,NICK,I don't know.
226257,L398758,u6706,m447,ALEX,Then where do we go?!
226258,L398757,u6712,m447,NICK,"Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers..."
226259,L398756,u6706,m447,ALEX,"The Police, then..."
226260,L398755,u6712,m447,NICK,It's already out.
226261,L398754,u6706,m447,ALEX,Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
226262,L398753,u6712,m447,NICK,"Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere."
226263,L398752,u6706,m447,ALEX,...but then it hits the relay stations...
226264,L398751,u6712,m447,NICK,It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
226265,L398750,u6706,m447,ALEX,Like the fractals?
226266,L398749,u6712,m447,NICK,Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
226267,L398748,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Nick, what is it."
226268,L398747,u6712,m447,NICK,"It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere."
226269,L398746,u6706,m447,ALEX,What?
226270,L398745,u6712,m447,NICK,That's what I thought.
226271,L398739,u6712,m447,NICK,My house.  I want to try something.
226272,L398738,u6706,m447,ALEX,Where do we go?
226273,L398736,u6712,m447,NICK,"We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!"
226274,L398735,u6706,m447,ALEX,We can't...
226275,L398734,u6712,m447,NICK,Then leave her.
226276,L398726,u6712,m447,NICK,What?!
226277,L398725,u6706,m447,ALEX,Change the channel!
226278,L398708,u6706,m447,ALEX,Let's go around back.
226279,L398707,u6712,m447,NICK,It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
226280,L398706,u6706,m447,ALEX,"This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?"
226281,L398702,u6706,m447,ALEX,Laurie's.
226282,L398701,u6712,m447,NICK,Where to now?
226283,L398700,u6706,m447,ALEX,She thought Benz was at school.
226284,L398699,u6712,m447,NICK,Well?
226285,L398690,u6712,m447,NICK,"Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?"
226286,L398689,u6706,m447,ALEX,"If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick."
226287,L398688,u6712,m447,NICK,No way.
226288,L398687,u6706,m447,ALEX,We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
226289,L398676,u6706,m447,ALEX,Sure.
226290,L398675,u6712,m447,NICK,"It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?"
226291,L398674,u6712,m447,NICK,It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
226292,L398673,u6706,m447,ALEX,Because I didn't know where else to go.
226293,L398671,u6706,m447,ALEX,All of them?
226294,L398670,u6712,m447,NICK,It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
226295,L398669,u6706,m447,ALEX,Something's happened to them.
226296,L398665,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Call the others.  Laurie, Benz..."
226297,L398664,u6712,m447,NICK,Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
226298,L398661,u6712,m447,NICK,No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
226299,L398660,u6706,m447,ALEX,"It turned itself back on, Nick."
226300,L398658,u6712,m447,NICK,"Quiet.  I do have parents, you know."
226301,L398657,u6706,m447,ALEX,"See, men always do this.  ""Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium"". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!"
226302,L398656,u6712,m447,NICK,You imagined it.
226303,L398655,u6706,m447,ALEX,"So how did it know my name, then?"
226304,L398654,u6712,m447,NICK,"How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive."
226305,L398653,u6706,m447,ALEX,It is.
226306,L398652,u6712,m447,NICK,"Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it..."
226307,L398651,u6706,m447,ALEX,"No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, ""In here""."
226308,L398650,u6706,m447,ALEX,"No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow."
226309,L398649,u6712,m447,NICK,Happy?
226310,L398648,u6706,m447,ALEX,Turn if off!
226311,L398647,u6712,m447,NICK,I'm in the middle of it...
226312,L398646,u6706,m447,ALEX,Can you turn off the game?
226313,L398645,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him."
226314,L398644,u6712,m447,NICK,"What do you mean by ""weird""?"
226315,L398639,u6706,m447,ALEX,Funny.
226316,L398638,u6712,m447,NICK,"Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this."
226317,L398633,u6706,m447,ALEX,I'm coming over.
226318,L398632,u6712,m447,NICK,It's twelve-thirty!
226319,L398631,u6706,m447,ALEX,"No, in person.  Now."
226320,L398630,u6712,m447,NICK,We are talking...
226321,L398629,u6706,m447,ALEX,I have to talk to you.
226322,L398627,u6712,m447,NICK,What the hell are you talking about?
226323,L398626,u6706,m447,ALEX,Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
226324,L398625,u6712,m447,NICK,Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
226325,L398624,u6706,m447,ALEX,Nick...
226326,L398623,u6712,m447,NICK,"Hey, kid."
226327,L398622,u6706,m447,ALEX,Hello?
226328,L398606,u6706,m447,ALEX,"But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him..."
226329,L398605,u6712,m447,NICK,So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
226330,L398604,u6706,m447,ALEX,Yeah...
226331,L398603,u6712,m447,NICK,Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
226332,L398602,u6712,m447,NICK,"Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?"
226333,L398601,u6706,m447,ALEX,So where is he?
226334,L399031,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Well, it's a long story..."
226335,L399030,u6710,m447,GREG,"So how did you do it, Alex?"
226336,L398586,u6710,m447,GREG,"Hold my keys, then."
226337,L398585,u6706,m447,ALEX,Go for it.
226338,L398539,u6710,m447,GREG,Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
226339,L398538,u6706,m447,ALEX,And then keep on driving?
226340,L398537,u6710,m447,GREG,"Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner."
226341,L398517,u6710,m447,GREG,Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
226342,L398516,u6706,m447,ALEX,I'm okay.
226343,L398515,u6710,m447,GREG,"So tell me you're okay, then."
226344,L398514,u6706,m447,ALEX,I know.
226345,L398513,u6710,m447,GREG,"Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak."
226346,L398995,u6706,m447,ALEX,Oh God...oh god...
226347,L398994,u6708,m447,BOY,It's here!!!
226348,L398993,u6706,m447,ALEX,"In this world, wrong is right!"
226349,L398992,u6708,m447,BOY,It's the wrong way!
226350,L398990,u6708,m447,BOY,That way.
226351,L398989,u6706,m447,ALEX,Which way?
226352,L398986,u6706,m447,ALEX,Then we'll go home.
226353,L398985,u6708,m447,BOY,Then we'll go home?
226354,L398982,u6706,m447,ALEX,Thought so.
226355,L398981,u6708,m447,BOY,Yes...
226356,L398980,u6706,m447,ALEX,How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
226357,L398970,u6711,m447,LAURIE,You have no time.
226358,L398969,u6706,m447,ALEX,I'm thinking!
226359,L398968,u6711,m447,LAURIE,You have no time.  What is your question?
226360,L398967,u6706,m447,ALEX,"Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!"
226361,L398966,u6706,m447,ALEX,Wait!  No!  That's not it!
226362,L398965,u6711,m447,LAURIE,Is that your question?
226363,L398964,u6706,m447,ALEX,What did he do to you?
226364,L399023,u6707,m447,ALEX'S MOTHER,"Not yet, honey..."
226365,L399022,u6706,m447,ALEX,Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
226366,L399020,u6706,m447,ALEX,Yes...but...how did you...
226367,L399019,u6707,m447,ALEX'S MOTHER,"I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?"
226368,L399018,u6707,m447,ALEX'S MOTHER,"I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you..."
226369,L399017,u6706,m447,ALEX,But I don't understand...
226370,L399016,u6707,m447,ALEX'S MOTHER,Of course I am.
226371,L399015,u6706,m447,ALEX,Mom?  You're alive...
226372,L398796,u6712,m447,NICK,The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
226373,L398795,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
226374,L398592,u6712,m447,NICK,Sign me up.
226375,L398591,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,So what do you think?
226376,L398573,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,The game will guide you.
226377,L398572,u6712,m447,NICK,So how do I start?
226378,L398571,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,"It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain."
226379,L398570,u6712,m447,NICK,So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
226380,L398566,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,"In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild..."
226381,L398565,u6712,m447,NICK,"""Escape""?"
226382,L398561,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
226383,L398560,u6712,m447,NICK,That's impossible.
226384,L398559,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,"A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy."
226385,L398558,u6712,m447,NICK,So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
226386,L398557,u6709,m447,DIFFORD,"We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us."
226387,L399038,u6713,m447,STILTS,I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
226388,L399037,u6711,m447,LAURIE,"Give her a chance, will you?"
226389,L399036,u6713,m447,STILTS,So start at the beginning...
226390,L398963,u6711,m447,LAURIE,I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
226391,L398962,u6713,m447,STILTS,I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
226392,L398961,u6711,m447,LAURIE,"One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware."
226393,L398533,u6713,m447,STILTS,Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
226394,L398532,u6711,m447,LAURIE,"Can you say anything but ""cool""?"
226395,L398531,u6713,m447,STILTS,Cool.
226396,L398509,u6713,m447,STILTS,Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
226397,L398508,u6711,m447,LAURIE,It means she's screwed up.
226398,L399385,u6714,m448,ADAM,Git along little dowgie and call me back.
226399,L399384,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"Okay, but you don't know what you're missing."
226400,L399383,u6714,m448,ADAM,"I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me."
226401,L399382,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,I'm just offering a place to stay.
226402,L399381,u6714,m448,ADAM,Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
226403,L399380,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place."
226404,L399379,u6714,m448,ADAM,"Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?"
226405,L399378,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,Will you meet with him?
226406,L399377,u6714,m448,ADAM,You gotta be kidding?
226407,L399376,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be."
226408,L399375,u6714,m448,ADAM,And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
226409,L399374,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,It's been a very strange day.
226410,L399373,u6714,m448,ADAM,Cynthia...what's going on?
226411,L399372,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away."
226412,L399371,u6714,m448,ADAM,"Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?"
226413,L399370,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea."
226414,L399369,u6714,m448,ADAM,The Cowboy??
226415,L399368,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
226416,L399367,u6714,m448,ADAM,Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
226417,L399366,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"I know, but you're broke. Where are you?"
226418,L399365,u6714,m448,ADAM,But I'm not broke.
226419,L399364,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,You're broke!
226420,L399363,u6714,m448,ADAM,And?
226421,L399362,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls."
226422,L399361,u6714,m448,ADAM,"What do you mean ""you know""?"
226423,L399360,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,I know.  Where are you Adam?
226424,L399359,u6714,m448,ADAM,Someone's shut off my money!
226425,L399268,u6714,m448,ADAM,I'm going home. I'll call you later.
226426,L399267,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do."
226427,L399266,u6714,m448,ADAM,I'm going home Cynthia.
226428,L399265,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
226429,L399264,u6714,m448,ADAM,I'm going home.
226430,L399263,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
226431,L399262,u6714,m448,ADAM,No.
226432,L399261,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
226433,L399260,u6714,m448,ADAM,Who fired everyone?
226434,L399259,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,They fired everyone.
226435,L399258,u6714,m448,ADAM,What did you say?
226436,L399257,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
226437,L399256,u6714,m448,ADAM,"What's going on, Cynthia?"
226438,L399255,u6719,m448,CYNTHIA,"Adam, where are you?"
226439,L399181,u6714,m448,ADAM,"And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!"
226440,L399180,u6732,m448,RAY,I'll speak to someone.
226441,L399179,u6714,m448,ADAM,"You'd better fix this, Ray!!!"
226442,L399162,u6714,m448,ADAM,Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
226443,L399161,u6732,m448,RAY,We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
226444,L399142,u6714,m448,ADAM,So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
226445,L399141,u6732,m448,RAY,There is no problem.
226446,L399140,u6714,m448,ADAM,So what's the problem?
226447,L399417,u6714,m448,ADAM,Okay.
226448,L399416,u6718,m448,COWBOY,"No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again."
226449,L399415,u6714,m448,ADAM,"So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?"
226450,L399414,u6718,m448,COWBOY,You're an understandin' fella.
226451,L399413,u6714,m448,ADAM,I understand.
226452,L399412,u6718,m448,COWBOY,"Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?"
226453,L399411,u6714,m448,ADAM,It will work out.
226454,L399410,u6718,m448,COWBOY,"Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault..."
226455,L399409,u6714,m448,ADAM,Okay.
226456,L399408,u6718,m448,COWBOY,So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
226457,L399407,u6714,m448,ADAM,One.
226458,L399406,u6718,m448,COWBOY,There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
226459,L399405,u6714,m448,ADAM,Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
226460,L399404,u6718,m448,COWBOY,No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
226461,L399403,u6714,m448,ADAM,"Okay, I'm thinking."
226462,L399402,u6718,m448,COWBOY,"Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?"
226463,L399401,u6714,m448,ADAM,How's that?
226464,L399400,u6718,m448,COWBOY,So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
226465,L399399,u6714,m448,ADAM,That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
226466,L399398,u6718,m448,COWBOY,What did I say?
226467,L399397,u6714,m448,ADAM,I agree with what you said...truly.
226468,L399396,u6718,m448,COWBOY,Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
226469,L399395,u6714,m448,ADAM,Sure.
226470,L399394,u6718,m448,COWBOY,A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
226471,L399393,u6714,m448,ADAM,Whatever.
226472,L399392,u6718,m448,COWBOY,"Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?"
226473,L399391,u6714,m448,ADAM,No problem. What's on your mind?
226474,L399390,u6718,m448,COWBOY,Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
226475,L399389,u6714,m448,ADAM,Yeah.
226476,L399388,u6718,m448,COWBOY,Beautiful night.
226477,L399387,u6714,m448,ADAM,Howdy to you.
226478,L399386,u6718,m448,COWBOY,Howdy!
226479,L399358,u6726,m448,HOTEL MANAGER,"Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher."
226480,L399357,u6714,m448,ADAM,Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
226481,L399356,u6726,m448,HOTEL MANAGER,"That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you."
226482,L399355,u6714,m448,ADAM,"Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?"
226483,L399354,u6726,m448,HOTEL MANAGER,"Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled."
226484,L399353,u6714,m448,ADAM,"So, what did they say?"
226485,L399352,u6726,m448,HOTEL MANAGER,I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
226486,L399351,u6714,m448,ADAM,How...  how'd they know I was here?
226487,L399350,u6726,m448,HOTEL MANAGER,The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
226488,L399349,u6714,m448,ADAM,... What??
226489,L399348,u6726,m448,HOTEL MANAGER,"I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card."
226490,L399347,u6714,m448,ADAM,Yes...what is it?
226491,L399483,u6717,m448,COCO,"Good luck, honey!"
226492,L399482,u6715,m448,BETTY,Right. See ya.
226493,L399481,u6717,m448,COCO,Get going. You don't want to be late.
226494,L399480,u6715,m448,BETTY,Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
226495,L399479,u6717,m448,COCO,Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
226496,L399478,u6715,m448,BETTY,Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
226497,L399477,u6717,m448,COCO,His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
226498,L399476,u6715,m448,BETTY,"No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind."
226499,L399475,u6717,m448,COCO,It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
226500,L399474,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Sorry to trouble you, Coco."
226501,L399454,u6717,m448,COCO,"Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it."
226502,L399453,u6715,m448,BETTY,You're really something Coco...thank you.
226503,L399451,u6715,m448,BETTY,Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
226504,L399450,u6717,m448,COCO,So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
226505,L399449,u6715,m448,BETTY,Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
226506,L399448,u6717,m448,COCO,"Sweetie, look at me straight."
226507,L399447,u6715,m448,BETTY,"It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ..."
226508,L399446,u6717,m448,COCO,She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
226509,L399445,u6715,m448,BETTY,I was afraid of that.
226510,L399444,u6717,m448,COCO,Your Aunt called me.
226511,L399105,u6717,m448,COCO,You got it! See you later honey.
226512,L399104,u6715,m448,BETTY,Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
226513,L399103,u6717,m448,COCO,"Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there."
226514,L399102,u6715,m448,BETTY,Wow!
226515,L399101,u6717,m448,COCO,I told ya.
226516,L399100,u6715,m448,BETTY,It's unbelievable!
226517,L399099,u6715,m448,BETTY,"I can hardly wait, Coco."
226518,L399098,u6717,m448,COCO,"That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one."
226519,L399097,u6715,m448,BETTY,"No, I don't."
226520,L399095,u6717,m448,COCO,"Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it."
226521,L399094,u6715,m448,BETTY,I guess I've come to quite a place.
226522,L399093,u6717,m448,COCO,"Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another."
226523,L399092,u6715,m448,BETTY,Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
226524,L399091,u6717,m448,COCO,"You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class."
226525,L399090,u6715,m448,BETTY,I...
226526,L399089,u6717,m448,COCO,"You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called ""tits and ass."""
226527,L399088,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Well, I ..."
226528,L399087,u6717,m448,COCO,Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
226529,L399086,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Yes, he is. He raises corn."
226530,L399085,u6717,m448,COCO,"I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear."
226531,L399116,u6715,m448,BETTY,Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
226532,L399115,u6721,m448,DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,My name is Rita.
226533,L399114,u6715,m448,BETTY,Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
226534,L399113,u6721,m448,DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,I think so. I was just taking a shower.
226535,L399112,u6715,m448,BETTY,Are you okay?
226536,L399111,u6721,m448,DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,A car ... a car accident.
226537,L399110,u6715,m448,BETTY,I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
226538,L399109,u6721,m448,DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,There was an accident. I came here.
226539,L399108,u6715,m448,BETTY,I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
226540,L399107,u6721,m448,DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,That's okay.
226541,L399513,u6735,m448,WALLY,"Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?"
226542,L399512,u6715,m448,BETTY,"No, no, I'm fine."
226543,L399511,u6735,m448,WALLY,Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
226544,L399510,u6715,m448,BETTY,Hi.
226545,L399505,u6735,m448,WALLY,Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
226546,L399504,u6715,m448,BETTY,Very pleased to meet you.
226547,L399503,u6735,m448,WALLY,I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
226548,L399502,u6715,m448,BETTY,Yes.
226549,L399501,u6735,m448,WALLY,Betty Elms?
226550,L399538,u6727,m448,JIMMY,Before what?
226551,L399537,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
226552,L399532,u6727,m448,JIMMY,But you won't.
226553,L399531,u6715,m448,BETTY,I can call them... I can call my dad.
226554,L399526,u6727,m448,JIMMY,I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
226555,L399525,u6715,m448,BETTY,You're still here?
226556,L399522,u6727,m448,JIMMY,"Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies."
226557,L399521,u6715,m448,BETTY,Betty.
226558,L399518,u6727,m448,JIMMY,"I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?"
226559,L399517,u6715,m448,BETTY,What?
226560,L399516,u6727,m448,JIMMY,"Just tell me where it hurts, baby."
226561,L399305,u6734,m448,SERGEANT BAXTER,May I have your name please?
226562,L399304,u6715,m448,BETTY,Was anyone hurt?
226563,L399303,u6734,m448,SERGEANT BAXTER,No. I can't.
226564,L399302,u6715,m448,BETTY,Can you tell me what happened?
226565,L399301,u6734,m448,SERGEANT BAXTER,"Yes, there was."
226566,L399300,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive."
226567,L399607,u6730,m448,MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN,I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
226568,L399606,u6715,m448,BETTY,Well ... we'll leave her a note.
226569,L399605,u6730,m448,MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN,I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
226570,L399604,u6715,m448,BETTY,But it said #12.
226571,L399603,u6730,m448,MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN,Number 17.
226572,L399602,u6715,m448,BETTY,Diane?
226573,L399601,u6730,m448,MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN,Yes?
226574,L399625,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet."
226575,L399624,u6733,m448,RITA,It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
226576,L399623,u6715,m448,BETTY,No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
226577,L399622,u6733,m448,RITA,But I want to.
226578,L399621,u6715,m448,BETTY,Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
226579,L399615,u6715,m448,BETTY,"I know what you have to do, but let me do it."
226580,L399614,u6733,m448,RITA,What ... I..HAVE... to do.
226581,L399613,u6715,m448,BETTY,Rita... I know what you're doing.
226582,L399611,u6733,m448,RITA,No.
226583,L399610,u6715,m448,BETTY,C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
226584,L399609,u6733,m448,RITA,I don't think...
226585,L399598,u6715,m448,BETTY,Keep going. Go around to the back.
226586,L399597,u6733,m448,RITA,No... but...
226587,L399596,u6715,m448,BETTY,Do you know them?!
226588,L399595,u6733,m448,RITA,"Those men in front, in the car."
226589,L399594,u6715,m448,BETTY,What is it? What do you see?!
226590,L399593,u6733,m448,RITA,Don't stop!
226591,L399591,u6715,m448,BETTY,You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
226592,L399590,u6733,m448,RITA,"But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble."
226593,L399589,u6715,m448,BETTY,Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
226594,L399473,u6733,m448,RITA,Okay.
226595,L399472,u6715,m448,BETTY,"When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go."
226596,L399471,u6733,m448,RITA,Good luck!
226597,L399470,u6715,m448,BETTY,I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
226598,L399456,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!"
226599,L399455,u6733,m448,RITA,Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
226600,L399440,u6715,m448,BETTY,You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
226601,L399439,u6733,m448,RITA,I'm all right.
226602,L399438,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?"
226603,L399433,u6733,m448,RITA,"""Then they'd put you in jail."""
226604,L399432,u6715,m448,BETTY,"""Before I kill you."""
226605,L399431,u6733,m448,RITA,"""Before what?"""
226606,L399430,u6715,m448,BETTY,"""Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."""
226607,L399429,u6733,m448,RITA,"""What about you? What will your dad think about you?"""
226608,L399428,u6715,m448,BETTY,"""Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... """
226609,L399427,u6733,m448,RITA,"""You know what I want...it's not that difficult."""
226610,L399426,u6715,m448,BETTY,"""You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."""
226611,L399425,u6733,m448,RITA,"""But you won't..."""
226612,L399424,u6715,m448,BETTY,"""I can call them... I can call my dad... """
226613,L399423,u6733,m448,RITA,"""So... surprise""..."
226614,L399422,u6715,m448,BETTY,"""My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."""
226615,L399421,u6733,m448,RITA,"""Really?"""
226616,L399419,u6733,m448,RITA,"""I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."""
226617,L399418,u6715,m448,BETTY,"""You're still here?"""
226618,L399333,u6715,m448,BETTY,I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
226619,L399332,u6733,m448,RITA,I'm not sure about this.
226620,L399331,u6715,m448,BETTY,What's wrong with that?
226621,L399324,u6733,m448,RITA,Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
226622,L399323,u6715,m448,BETTY,Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
226623,L399322,u6733,m448,RITA,It's not my voice ... but I know her.
226624,L399320,u6715,m448,BETTY,Call the number.
226625,L399319,u6733,m448,RITA,Maybe it's not me.
226626,L399318,u6715,m448,BETTY,Strange to be calling yourself.
226627,L399312,u6715,m448,BETTY,We'll take our check.
226628,L399311,u6733,m448,RITA,No. Just the coffee.
226629,L399308,u6715,m448,BETTY,Not that I can see.
226630,L399307,u6733,m448,RITA,There's nothing?
226631,L399279,u6715,m448,BETTY,Come on... let's find you something to wear.
226632,L399278,u6733,m448,RITA,Okay.
226633,L399277,u6715,m448,BETTY,Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
226634,L399276,u6733,m448,RITA,Okay... but just...just to see.
226635,L399275,u6715,m448,BETTY,We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
226636,L399274,u6733,m448,RITA,No.... I don't...
226637,L399273,u6715,m448,BETTY,Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
226638,L399272,u6733,m448,RITA,That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
226639,L399271,u6715,m448,BETTY,Mulholland Drive?
226640,L399270,u6733,m448,RITA,Mulholland Drive.
226641,L399246,u6715,m448,BETTY,When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
226642,L399245,u6733,m448,RITA,"Unh, unh."
226643,L399244,u6715,m448,BETTY,The money. You don't know where it came from?
226644,L399243,u6733,m448,RITA,No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
226645,L399242,u6715,m448,BETTY,You don't remember anything else?
226646,L399241,u6733,m448,RITA,I don't know.
226647,L399240,u6715,m448,BETTY,How do you remember how to talk?
226648,L399239,u6733,m448,RITA,"Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it."
226649,L399238,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?"
226650,L399237,u6733,m448,RITA,What do you mean?
226651,L399236,u6715,m448,BETTY,Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
226652,L399197,u6733,m448,RITA,I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
226653,L399196,u6715,m448,BETTY,What do you mean? You're Rita.
226654,L399195,u6733,m448,RITA,I don't know who I am.
226655,L399194,u6715,m448,BETTY,What's wrong?
226656,L399193,u6733,m448,RITA,I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
226657,L399192,u6715,m448,BETTY,What is it Rita?
226658,L399128,u6715,m448,BETTY,"All right, but...I'm going to check on you."
226659,L399127,u6733,m448,RITA,It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
226660,L399126,u6715,m448,BETTY,If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
226661,L399125,u6733,m448,RITA,No...I need to sleep.
226662,L399124,u6715,m448,BETTY,"But, this could be serious."
226663,L399123,u6733,m448,RITA,No.
226664,L399122,u6715,m448,BETTY,Oh...
226665,L399121,u6733,m448,RITA,I think I've been hurt.
226666,L399120,u6715,m448,BETTY,"She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel."
226667,L399119,u6733,m448,RITA,She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
226668,L399118,u6715,m448,BETTY,I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
226669,L399117,u6733,m448,RITA,No ..........I.
226670,L399495,u6715,m448,BETTY,Thank you... thank you very much.
226671,L399494,u6731,m448,PARAMOUNT GUARD,Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
226672,L399493,u6715,m448,BETTY,Betty Elms.
226673,L399492,u6731,m448,PARAMOUNT GUARD,Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
226674,L399491,u6715,m448,BETTY,"Yes, Sir."
226675,L399490,u6731,m448,PARAMOUNT GUARD,"Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?"
226676,L399489,u6715,m448,BETTY,"No, we don't."
226677,L399488,u6731,m448,PARAMOUNT GUARD,And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
226678,L399487,u6715,m448,BETTY,Wally Brown.
226679,L399486,u6731,m448,PARAMOUNT GUARD,And who are we auditioning for today?
226680,L399485,u6715,m448,BETTY,To my audition.
226681,L399220,u6728,m448,JOE,"It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van."
226682,L399219,u6716,m448,BILLY,Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
226683,L399218,u6728,m448,JOE,What's  the matter now?
226684,L399217,u6716,m448,BILLY,"Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all."
226685,L399216,u6728,m448,JOE,"Yeah, what for?"
226686,L399215,u6716,m448,BILLY,"Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all."
226687,L399214,u6728,m448,JOE,You're so easy.
226688,L399213,u6716,m448,BILLY,"My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon."
226689,L399212,u6728,m448,JOE,"No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy."
226690,L399211,u6716,m448,BILLY,"Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them."
226691,L399067,u6725,m448,HERB,Right then.
226692,L399066,u6720,m448,DAN,To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
226693,L399065,u6725,m448,HERB,"So, you came to see if he's out there?"
226694,L399064,u6720,m448,DAN,"Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream."
226695,L399063,u6725,m448,HERB,"Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me."
226696,L399062,u6720,m448,DAN,You see what I mean...
226697,L399061,u6725,m448,HERB,Oh boy.
226698,L399060,u6720,m448,DAN,I had a dream about this place.
226699,L399059,u6725,m448,HERB,Go ahead.
226700,L399058,u6720,m448,DAN,"It's kind of embarrassing but,"
226701,L399057,u6725,m448,HERB,Okay. Why this Denny's?
226702,L399056,u6720,m448,DAN,This Denny's.
226703,L399055,u6725,m448,HERB,"To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?"
226704,L399054,u6720,m448,DAN,I just wanted to come here.
226705,L399053,u6725,m448,HERB,Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
226706,L399469,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,"Damn, that's a long drive."
226707,L399468,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,Palmdale.
226708,L399467,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,Where at?
226709,L399466,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
226710,L399465,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,Interesting.
226711,L399464,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,"Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere."
226712,L399463,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,Find out who they are?
226713,L399462,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,"Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is."
226714,L399461,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,Oh yeah.
226715,L399460,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
226716,L399459,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,The one of 'em still alive?
226717,L399458,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
226718,L399457,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,Nice wallets.
226719,L399052,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,That's what I'm thinkin'.
226720,L399051,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
226721,L399050,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
226722,L399049,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,Could be unrelated.
226723,L399048,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,"Yeah, they showed me"
226724,L399047,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
226725,L399046,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
226726,L399045,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
226727,L399044,u6723,m448,DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD,Yeah.
226728,L399043,u6722,m448,DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT,You feel it?
226729,L399137,u6728,m448,JOE,"Yeah, that's a funny story."
226730,L399136,u6724,m448,ED,It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
226731,L399135,u6728,m448,JOE,"Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble."
226732,L399134,u6724,m448,ED,"Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough."
226733,L399133,u6728,m448,JOE,Hardly.
226734,L399132,u6724,m448,ED,"Making ends meet, huh."
226735,L399131,u6728,m448,JOE,"Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy."
226736,L399130,u6724,m448,ED,"Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?"
226737,L399129,u6728,m448,JOE,"So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that."
226738,L399229,u6729,m448,LANEY,Sure.
226739,L399228,u6728,m448,JOE,You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
226740,L399227,u6729,m448,LANEY,No...
226741,L399226,u6728,m448,JOE,A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
226742,L399225,u6729,m448,LANEY,No.  I haven't seen any.
226743,L399224,u6728,m448,JOE,"Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there."
226744,L399223,u6729,m448,LANEY,No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
226745,L399222,u6728,m448,JOE,Not a coke or anything?
226746,L399221,u6729,m448,LANEY,Not here...no thanks.
226747,L401919,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit."
226748,L401918,u6736,m449,ANNOUNCER,You must come in first place to move on !
226749,L401796,u6736,m449,ANNOUNCER,Pick with expediency !
226750,L401795,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
226751,L401794,u6736,m449,ANNOUNCER,"So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out."
226752,L401690,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
226753,L401689,u6736,m449,ANNOUNCER,And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
226754,L401682,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Where's the dock ?
226755,L401681,u6736,m449,ANNOUNCER,That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
226756,L401543,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny."
226757,L401542,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems."
226758,L401540,u6743,m449,ZACH,I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
226759,L401539,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Good morning. What do you have today ?
226760,L401401,u6737,m449,BRUCE,No one has a gun to your head.
226761,L401400,u6743,m449,ZACH,"I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die."
226762,L401399,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you."
226763,L401396,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Yeah, I'd say that's it."
226764,L401395,u6743,m449,ZACH,Is that it ?
226765,L402053,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Bye....
226766,L402052,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Well, I'll see you at the next staff party."
226767,L402051,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Yeah a real shame.
226768,L402050,u6737,m449,BRUCE,That's a shame.
226769,L402049,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week."
226770,L402048,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?"
226771,L402047,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,That was eleven years ago.
226772,L402046,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I work here, remember ?"
226773,L402045,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What are you DOING here ?
226774,L401983,u6737,m449,BRUCE,It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
226775,L401982,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Just stop it. End it here.
226776,L401977,u6737,m449,BRUCE,There's one more person here for me to visit.
226777,L401976,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What about you ?
226778,L401952,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Girder, watch your head."
226779,L401951,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What was that ?
226780,L401950,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Yes.
226781,L401949,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Do you know where you're going ?
226782,L401930,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it."
226783,L401929,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I don't get it.
226784,L401908,u6737,m449,BRUCE,The Brooklyn Bridge.
226785,L401907,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Where are we going ?
226786,L401904,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Great...
226787,L401903,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"You don't. It's random, there no trick."
226788,L401902,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?"
226789,L401901,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real."
226790,L401900,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,This is cute.
226791,L401899,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Let's go.
226792,L401898,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid."
226793,L401889,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Fine...
226794,L401888,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,You okay ?
226795,L401887,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Okay.
226796,L401886,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up."
226797,L401881,u6737,m449,BRUCE,So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
226798,L401880,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
226799,L401879,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Know what ? That it was your fault ?
226800,L401878,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I wanted to let his family know....
226801,L401877,u6737,m449,BRUCE,You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
226802,L401876,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I... I .....
226803,L401874,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things."
226804,L401873,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?"
226805,L401872,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?"
226806,L401871,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours."
226807,L401870,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
226808,L401869,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years."
226809,L401868,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,And you believe that ?
226810,L401867,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses....."
226811,L401866,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What do you mean ?
226812,L401865,u6737,m449,BRUCE,There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
226813,L401864,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired."
226814,L401863,u6737,m449,BRUCE,There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
226815,L401862,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?"
226816,L401861,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong."
226817,L401860,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
226818,L401859,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything."
226819,L401858,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
226820,L401857,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here."
226821,L401849,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
226822,L401848,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,He hired you to build this place ?
226823,L401847,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
226824,L401846,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Do you have something better to talk about ?
226825,L401845,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Is this really the time ?
226826,L401844,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Why did you build this whole place ?
226827,L401843,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Excuse me ?
226828,L401842,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,So why this ?
226829,L401840,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
226830,L401839,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,How long till the room fills ?
226831,L401838,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out."
226832,L401837,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Obviously, but what's the way out ?"
226833,L401836,u6737,m449,BRUCE,We drown.
226834,L401835,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What's the trick here ?
226835,L401829,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about."
226836,L401828,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I'm listening.
226837,L401827,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me."
226838,L401826,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Not listening !
226839,L401825,u6737,m449,BRUCE,It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
226840,L401807,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
226841,L401806,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
226842,L401805,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I'm not listening.
226843,L401804,u6737,m449,BRUCE,So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
226844,L401793,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Why would he ? His parents are rich.
226845,L401792,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
226846,L401791,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,NO ! I wouldn't do that.
226847,L401790,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
226848,L401789,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
226849,L401788,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here."
226850,L401787,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
226851,L401786,u6737,m449,BRUCE,You took an awful big risk back there.
226852,L401785,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What ?
226853,L401784,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
226854,L401779,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I'm leaving.
226855,L401778,u6737,m449,BRUCE,What are you doing ?
226856,L401769,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Knows ? He watches every ""Guest"" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we."
226857,L401768,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,McCay knows ?
226858,L401767,u6737,m449,BRUCE,It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
226859,L401766,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,First Bank ? But how ?
226860,L401765,u6737,m449,BRUCE,It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
226861,L401764,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
226862,L401763,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I'm working on it.
226863,L401762,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,So what do we do ?
226864,L401761,u6737,m449,BRUCE,No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
226865,L401760,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,So where does this lead ?
226866,L401739,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Give me a fucking.....
226867,L401738,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Come on, it works."
226868,L401730,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
226869,L401729,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt."
226870,L401726,u6737,m449,BRUCE,We have to climb up that.
226871,L401725,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
226872,L401717,u6737,m449,BRUCE,We wait. This is an elevator.
226873,L401716,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,How do we get out of this room ?
226874,L401697,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I don't know.
226875,L401696,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Now where do we go ?
226876,L401667,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I'm not fucking him..
226877,L401666,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords."
226878,L401665,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
226879,L401664,u6737,m449,BRUCE,You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
226880,L401663,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?"
226881,L401662,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Why should I ?
226882,L401661,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
226883,L401648,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,No !
226884,L401647,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Leave him, he's dead."
226885,L401646,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What about Matt ?
226886,L401636,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this...."
226887,L401635,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Why should we trust you ?
226888,L401600,u6737,m449,BRUCE,No time. Get him up.
226889,L401599,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Where are we ?
226890,L401582,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am."
226891,L401581,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What's going on ?
226892,L401580,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held....."
226893,L401981,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Don't have to tell me twice.
226894,L401980,u6737,m449,BRUCE,He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
226895,L401975,u6737,m449,BRUCE,In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
226896,L401974,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Where ?
226897,L401973,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Almost. Look, you two get out of here."
226898,L401972,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Is it over ?
226899,L401750,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Thanks...
226900,L401749,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Knock yourself out.
226901,L401748,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?"
226902,L401741,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Ow...
226903,L401740,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,You okay ?
226904,L401737,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Swimming, you know, like in water, moron."
226905,L401736,u6737,m449,BRUCE,What the fuck are you talking about.
226906,L401735,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Hey, try swimming. It works."
226907,L401732,u6737,m449,BRUCE,That's cute asshole.
226908,L401731,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
226909,L401728,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Look...
226910,L401727,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,That's not to tough.
226911,L401724,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting."
226912,L401723,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
226913,L401722,u6737,m449,BRUCE,It's fine thanks.
226914,L401719,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now."
226915,L401718,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,An elevator ?
226916,L401713,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you."
226917,L401712,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire."
226918,L401711,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Are you hunting wabbits ?
226919,L401710,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Be very, very quiet..."
226920,L401709,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
226921,L401708,u6737,m449,BRUCE,A dragon.
226922,L401707,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,What's next Walt ?
226923,L401699,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it."
226924,L401698,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,I thought you made this place ?
226925,L401688,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Why ?
226926,L401687,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I'd get out of the water if I were you.
226927,L401686,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
226928,L401680,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Not quite....
226929,L401679,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Is it over ?
226930,L401660,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Because of my charming personality ?
226931,L401659,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ?"
226932,L401651,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I don't help criminals.
226933,L401650,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !"
226934,L401641,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,And that's different than this because...... ?
226935,L401640,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go."
226936,L401639,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?"
226937,L401634,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner."
226938,L401633,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
226939,L401632,u6737,m449,BRUCE,NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
226940,L401626,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I told him not to sit down in there.....
226941,L401625,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
226942,L401622,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Just shut the fuck up.
226943,L401621,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
226944,L401620,u6737,m449,BRUCE,NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
226945,L401584,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"43 unpaid parking tickets, sir."
226946,L401583,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
226947,L401579,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Hey , Hey !"
226948,L401578,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest."
226949,L401577,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?"
226950,L401576,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Are you Matthew Parker ?
226951,L401997,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"For once in your life, shut the fuck up."
226952,L401996,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?"
226953,L401894,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
226954,L401893,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
226955,L401557,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Checking........
226956,L401556,u6737,m449,BRUCE,A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
226957,L401555,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Yeah, but we're talking 43."
226958,L401554,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Parking tickets ? That's it ?
226959,L401553,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
226960,L401552,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Any priors ? Any police record ?
226961,L401551,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?"
226962,L401550,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems...."
226963,L401549,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,He probably has a history of this shit.
226964,L401548,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"He already had a balance of $600,000."
226965,L401547,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,So ?
226966,L401546,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account."
226967,L401545,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I just want to double check the facts.
226968,L401544,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,What's wrong ?
226969,L401515,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat."
226970,L401514,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,You did.
226971,L401513,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?"
226972,L401512,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay."
226973,L401511,u6737,m449,BRUCE,No.
226974,L401510,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?"
226975,L401509,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival."
226976,L401508,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody."
226977,L401507,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Trust is earned not given away.
226978,L401506,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person."
226979,L401505,u6737,m449,BRUCE,When you are ready.
226980,L401504,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,When will that be ?
226981,L401503,u6737,m449,BRUCE,When I think you're ready.
226982,L401502,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
226983,L401501,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Hand me the 3/8ths.
226984,L401404,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !"
226985,L401403,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"Johnny, let's get the cleanup started."
226986,L401394,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Got it.
226987,L401393,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Stop the hydraulics.
226988,L401392,u6737,m449,BRUCE,I said NO.
226989,L401391,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"But, he's..."
226990,L401390,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Not yet.
226991,L401389,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
226992,L401386,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
226993,L401385,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
226994,L401382,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Yes, sir Mom."
226995,L401381,u6737,m449,BRUCE,"It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away."
226996,L401380,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,What ? Are you my mother ?
226997,L401379,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Don't eat at the console.
226998,L401378,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,What ?
226999,L401377,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Don't.
227000,L401376,u6737,m449,BRUCE,Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
227001,L401375,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
227002,L401433,u6738,m449,FRED THOMISON,We will start work on it now sir.
227003,L401432,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?"
227004,L401431,u6738,m449,FRED THOMISON,"Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good...."
227005,L401430,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
227006,L401429,u6738,m449,FRED THOMISON,"Excuse me, sir ?"
227007,L401428,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,Fire the whole division.
227008,L401427,u6738,m449,FRED THOMISON,Well ?
227009,L401820,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
227010,L401819,u6743,m449,ZACH,Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
227011,L401818,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
227012,L401817,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you."
227013,L401816,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?"
227014,L401815,u6743,m449,ZACH,Sir ?
227015,L401814,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,One moment dear...
227016,L401813,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Better, sir."
227017,L401812,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,Is it as good as I hope it is ?
227018,L401811,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Good, sir."
227019,L401810,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?"
227020,L401809,u6743,m449,ZACH,Zachary.
227021,L401484,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable."
227022,L401483,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen."
227023,L401482,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?"
227024,L401481,u6743,m449,ZACH,"John, sir."
227025,L401480,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Do you think the assistant, what's his name..."
227026,L401479,u6743,m449,ZACH,What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
227027,L401478,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
227028,L401477,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps."
227029,L401476,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
227030,L401475,u6743,m449,ZACH,Sir ?
227031,L401474,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
227032,L401473,u6743,m449,ZACH,What do you mean sir ?
227033,L401472,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
227034,L401471,u6743,m449,ZACH,Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
227035,L401470,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"That mail room kid was the longest lasting ""guest"" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another ""guest"" from the more athletic of our staff."
227036,L401469,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the ""park"" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing."
227037,L401468,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the ""Park"" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?"
227038,L401467,u6743,m449,ZACH,"That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested ""guests""."
227039,L401466,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the ""guests"" being of the more nefarious type."
227040,L401465,u6743,m449,ZACH,"But sir, most of the people we are putting into the ""Park"" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess."
227041,L401464,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
227042,L401463,u6743,m449,ZACH,"I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the ""guests"" might take longer to expire."
227043,L401462,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,That was rather.... disappointing.
227044,L401461,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Son, let's watch the tape."
227045,L401460,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal."
227046,L401459,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Thank you, sir."
227047,L401458,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
227048,L401457,u6743,m449,ZACH,Yes sir.
227049,L401456,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?"
227050,L401455,u6743,m449,ZACH,I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
227051,L401454,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,And how much do we pay you annually ?
227052,L401453,u6743,m449,ZACH,I am thirty two.
227053,L401452,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Zach, how old are you, son ?"
227054,L401451,u6743,m449,ZACH,"While I am not morally against these little, shall we say ""hobbies"", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?"
227055,L401450,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,Of course.
227056,L401449,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?"
227057,L401448,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass."
227058,L401447,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park."
227059,L401446,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?"
227060,L401445,u6743,m449,ZACH,"I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?"
227061,L401444,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive."
227062,L401443,u6743,m449,ZACH,Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
227063,L401442,u6739,m449,JOHN C. MCCAY,"Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?"
227064,L401944,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here"
227065,L401943,u6743,m449,ZACH,Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
227066,L401942,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
227067,L401941,u6743,m449,ZACH,How can this happen ?
227068,L401940,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,The power went out in half the park.
227069,L401939,u6743,m449,ZACH,What happened ?
227070,L401938,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,What the ... ?
227071,L401916,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
227072,L401915,u6743,m449,ZACH,So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
227073,L401906,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I think I'll see hat action.
227074,L401905,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them."
227075,L401892,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far."
227076,L401891,u6743,m449,ZACH,Thank you very much.
227077,L401885,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead."
227078,L401884,u6743,m449,ZACH,Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
227079,L401883,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,<<belch>>
227080,L401882,u6743,m449,ZACH,That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
227081,L401824,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I can see that but where ?
227082,L401823,u6743,m449,ZACH,There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
227083,L401822,u6743,m449,ZACH,Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
227084,L401821,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Was that the Old Man ?
227085,L401783,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,You're paying the bills.
227086,L401782,u6743,m449,ZACH,I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
227087,L401781,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought."
227088,L401780,u6743,m449,ZACH,Look ! Look !
227089,L401773,u6743,m449,ZACH,I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
227090,L401772,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Look he figured it out !
227091,L401757,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours."
227092,L401756,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Maybe you should get over fears.
227093,L401706,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
227094,L401705,u6743,m449,ZACH,Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
227095,L401695,u6743,m449,ZACH,I'll see that bet.
227096,L401694,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
227097,L401655,u6743,m449,ZACH,I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
227098,L401654,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I have a turn for the worse for the team !
227099,L401653,u6743,m449,ZACH,What's next ?
227100,L401638,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps."
227101,L401637,u6743,m449,ZACH,Will he make it out ?
227102,L401618,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
227103,L401617,u6743,m449,ZACH,We can't afford too many surprises.
227104,L401616,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
227105,L401615,u6743,m449,ZACH,What was that ?
227106,L401614,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I don't know.....
227107,L401613,u6743,m449,ZACH,What is Bruce doing ?
227108,L401596,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,What ?????
227109,L401595,u6743,m449,ZACH,Bruce has just awaken.
227110,L401594,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
227111,L401593,u6743,m449,ZACH,How long till the drug wears off ?
227112,L401592,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Aren't you the bitter one.
227113,L401591,u6743,m449,ZACH,Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
227114,L401590,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,So who are these people with the Boss ?
227115,L401538,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I'm listening.
227116,L401537,u6743,m449,ZACH,I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
227117,L401536,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,No I am not.
227118,L401535,u6743,m449,ZACH,Are you happy with your salary and position ?
227119,L401534,u6743,m449,ZACH,We can't.
227120,L401533,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new ""Park""."
227121,L401532,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Have you ever considered running your own ""Park"" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession."
227122,L401531,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,Then what do you want ?
227123,L401530,u6743,m449,ZACH,No. I am not a homosexual.
227124,L401529,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
227125,L401528,u6743,m449,ZACH,"I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?"
227126,L401527,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
227127,L401526,u6743,m449,ZACH,Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
227128,L401525,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,I was.
227129,L401524,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job."
227130,L401523,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,What did you hear ?
227131,L401522,u6743,m449,ZACH,No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
227132,L401521,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,He's been expecting you.
227133,L401520,u6743,m449,ZACH,"We have new ""guests"" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?"
227134,L401519,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?"
227135,L401398,u6743,m449,ZACH,"I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?"
227136,L401397,u6740,m449,JOHNNY,"He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy."
227137,L402044,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,I'm going to go ahead and go now.
227138,L402043,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Why don't you shut up now.
227139,L402042,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now."
227140,L402040,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  ""Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?"" or ""You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought""."
227141,L402039,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,No.
227142,L402038,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
227143,L402037,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
227144,L402036,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Hey buddy. You okay ?
227145,L402035,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
227146,L402027,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Who was that guy anyway ?
227147,L402026,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,He was right behind me !
227148,L402023,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Come to the rescue again I see.
227149,L402022,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
227150,L402006,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Where are we ?
227151,L402005,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"No, idiot. Where do we go now ?"
227152,L402004,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,I want to go to sleep for about a month.
227153,L402003,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What now ?
227154,L402002,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,We made it !
227155,L402001,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
227156,L402000,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then...."
227157,L401999,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything."
227158,L401994,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I'm fine.
227159,L401993,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
227160,L401979,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Zach from work ?
227161,L401978,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
227162,L401967,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Nothing.
227163,L401966,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What ?
227164,L401965,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
227165,L401964,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Shut up ! It's me.
227166,L401963,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
227167,L401721,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"""How's your foot"" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?"
227168,L401720,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,How's your foot ?
227169,L401669,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,We just having our first date when you showed up.
227170,L401668,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,You don't have to sound so emphatic.
227171,L401658,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
227172,L401657,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I'm talking to you asshole !
227173,L401631,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Which one, this door is locked !"
227174,L401630,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??"
227175,L401628,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget."
227176,L401627,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Are you okay ?
227177,L401624,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,I just need to sit and think for a second.
227178,L401623,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I think we should follow him...
227179,L401611,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,What the hell kind of cop are you ?
227180,L401610,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?"
227181,L401605,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,No ! Just get up. This is serious.
227182,L401604,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Hey... did we uhm, you know...."
227183,L401603,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Wake up, we're in trouble."
227184,L401602,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Not now, Mom."
227185,L401575,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Yahoo !!!!!
227186,L401574,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !"
227187,L401573,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
227188,L401572,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?"
227189,L401571,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
227190,L401570,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?"
227191,L401569,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch."
227192,L401568,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?"
227193,L401567,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money."
227194,L401566,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
227195,L401565,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Yes, Excuse me for a second."
227196,L401564,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Are you okay ?
227197,L401563,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Thank you.
227198,L401562,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,What an incredible view !
227199,L401561,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Thanks.
227200,L401560,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Thank you, won't you come in ?"
227201,L401559,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Hi. I brought some wine.
227202,L401558,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Hello.
227203,L401496,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Sure.
227204,L401495,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?"
227205,L401494,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,As appealing as that sounds...
227206,L401493,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel."
227207,L401492,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Yes.
227208,L401491,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Really ? On a date ?
227209,L401490,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Yes.
227210,L401489,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?"
227211,L401488,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Do you want to go out with me ?
227212,L401487,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're..."
227213,L401486,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
227214,L401485,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S."
227215,L401423,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Excuse me, gentlemen"
227216,L401422,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,"Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?"
227217,L401421,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,I meant him.
227218,L401420,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Thank you.
227219,L401419,u6741,m449,MATTHEW,Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
227220,L401439,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
227221,L401438,u6743,m449,ZACH,"Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry."
227222,L401437,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
227223,L401436,u6743,m449,ZACH,We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
227224,L401417,u6743,m449,ZACH,Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
227225,L401416,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
227226,L401415,u6743,m449,ZACH,I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
227227,L401414,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,"Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up."
227228,L401413,u6743,m449,ZACH,Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
227229,L401412,u6742,m449,SAUNDRA,Good morning.
227230,L401411,u6743,m449,ZACH,Good morning.
227231,L403532,u6744,m450,ALFRED,"Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman."
227232,L403531,u6760,m450,VADA,"No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you."
227233,L403530,u6744,m450,ALFRED,Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
227234,L403529,u6760,m450,VADA,I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
227235,L403528,u6744,m450,ALFRED,I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
227236,L403527,u6760,m450,VADA,People said she looked like me.
227237,L403524,u6744,m450,ALFRED,Ohhhhh.
227238,L403523,u6760,m450,VADA,Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
227239,L403522,u6744,m450,ALFRED,UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
227240,L403521,u6760,m450,VADA,My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
227241,L403520,u6744,m450,ALFRED,"No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up."
227242,L403519,u6760,m450,VADA,Do you still teach?
227243,L403518,u6744,m450,ALFRED,"Oh, just put it over there."
227244,L403517,u6760,m450,VADA,"Umm, where do you want this?"
227245,L403510,u6744,m450,ALFRED,"No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?"
227246,L403509,u6760,m450,VADA,Are you writing a poem?
227247,L403508,u6744,m450,ALFRED,You had to remind me?
227248,L403295,u6760,m450,VADA,I don't even know your name.
227249,L403294,u6745,m450,BOY,Don't mention it.
227250,L403293,u6760,m450,VADA,THANK YOU.
227251,L403292,u6745,m450,BOY,"Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;."
227252,L403291,u6760,m450,VADA,I don't think you're very polite.
227253,L403290,u6745,m450,BOY,What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
227254,L403289,u6760,m450,VADA,"Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!"
227255,L403288,u6760,m450,VADA,"Gee, that is a problem."
227256,L403287,u6745,m450,BOY,My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
227257,L403286,u6760,m450,VADA,Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
227258,L403285,u6745,m450,BOY,"Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??"
227259,L403284,u6760,m450,VADA,"This is California, anything is possible."
227260,L403283,u6745,m450,BOY,"Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?"
227261,L403282,u6760,m450,VADA,Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
227262,L403281,u6745,m450,BOY,Your Uncle Phil told me.
227263,L403280,u6760,m450,VADA,How did you know my name?
227264,L403279,u6745,m450,BOY,You're Vada right?
227265,L403278,u6760,m450,VADA,"I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns."
227266,L403277,u6745,m450,BOY,Excuse me I asked you a question.
227267,L403746,u6746,m450,DARYL,"Me, I'll know!"
227268,L403745,u6754,m450,NICK,So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
227269,L403738,u6746,m450,DARYL,You're still asking me to break the law.
227270,L403737,u6754,m450,NICK,I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
227271,L403736,u6746,m450,DARYL,I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
227272,L403735,u6754,m450,NICK,"Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but..."
227273,L403734,u6746,m450,DARYL,I thought I told you to lose this guy.
227274,L403733,u6754,m450,NICK,Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
227275,L403427,u6746,m450,DARYL,What about living in the real world pal?
227276,L403426,u6754,m450,NICK,What about giving the other guy a break.
227277,L403425,u6746,m450,DARYL,Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
227278,L403422,u6746,m450,DARYL,I would do it again in a minute.
227279,L403421,u6754,m450,NICK,What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
227280,L403748,u6746,m450,DARYL,"Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine."
227281,L403747,u6760,m450,VADA,Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
227282,L403744,u6746,m450,DARYL,Could you hold on for a second?
227283,L403743,u6760,m450,VADA,I'm leaving Sunday.
227284,L403742,u6746,m450,DARYL,Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
227285,L403741,u6760,m450,VADA,Pommeroy.
227286,L403740,u6746,m450,DARYL,"Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey...."
227287,L403732,u6760,m450,VADA,"His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?"
227288,L403731,u6746,m450,DARYL,I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
227289,L403420,u6746,m450,DARYL,"Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks."
227290,L403419,u6760,m450,VADA,"Suspended from school, my mother??"
227291,L403418,u6746,m450,DARYL,She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
227292,L403415,u6746,m450,DARYL,You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
227293,L403414,u6760,m450,VADA,"Wow, you walked out with my mother?"
227294,L403413,u6746,m450,DARYL,"Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor."
227295,L403412,u6760,m450,VADA,What do you remember about her.
227296,L403411,u6746,m450,DARYL,"It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way."
227297,L403887,u6747,m450,HARRY,You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
227298,L403886,u6760,m450,VADA,Can I see him?
227299,L403885,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother."
227300,L403884,u6760,m450,VADA,We have a baby?
227301,L403883,u6747,m450,HARRY,She just had a baby that's all.
227302,L403882,u6760,m450,VADA,What happened to Shelly?
227303,L403727,u6760,m450,VADA,Give my love to Shelly.
227304,L403726,u6747,m450,HARRY,"I love you too sweetie, bye."
227305,L403725,u6760,m450,VADA,"Okay...bye daddy, I love you."
227306,L403724,u6747,m450,HARRY,Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
227307,L403723,u6760,m450,VADA,I will. How's Shelly?
227308,L403722,u6747,m450,HARRY,Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
227309,L403721,u6760,m450,VADA,Totally.
227310,L403720,u6747,m450,HARRY,Totally groovy huh?
227311,L403719,u6760,m450,VADA,Yeah.
227312,L403716,u6760,m450,VADA,"Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy."
227313,L403715,u6747,m450,HARRY,Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
227314,L403714,u6760,m450,VADA,I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
227315,L403713,u6747,m450,HARRY,Hi honey.
227316,L403712,u6760,m450,VADA,Hi Dad.
227317,L403711,u6747,m450,HARRY,Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
227318,L403272,u6747,m450,HARRY,Have fun.
227319,L403271,u6760,m450,VADA,I'll be back in 137 hours.
227320,L403270,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Thanks, I needed that."
227321,L403269,u6760,m450,VADA,"Bye Dad, I'll miss you."
227322,L403268,u6747,m450,HARRY,It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
227323,L403267,u6760,m450,VADA,What does that mean?
227324,L403266,u6747,m450,HARRY,"And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability."
227325,L403265,u6760,m450,VADA,"No nuns, got it."
227326,L403252,u6760,m450,VADA,"I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday."
227327,L403251,u6747,m450,HARRY,What??
227328,L403250,u6760,m450,VADA,I already bought a ticket.
227329,L403249,u6747,m450,HARRY,Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
227330,L403248,u6760,m450,VADA,"I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California."
227331,L403247,u6747,m450,HARRY,Of course.
227332,L403246,u6760,m450,VADA,You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
227333,L403188,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?"
227334,L403187,u6760,m450,VADA,Was it a nice funeral?
227335,L403186,u6747,m450,HARRY,"She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone."
227336,L403183,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float."
227337,L403182,u6760,m450,VADA,"Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?"
227338,L403181,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!"
227339,L403180,u6760,m450,VADA,There's still a big spot on the floor.
227340,L403144,u6747,m450,HARRY,Her favorite poet.
227341,L403143,u6760,m450,VADA,The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
227342,L403124,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out."
227343,L403123,u6760,m450,VADA,So you're saying...What are you saying??
227344,L403118,u6760,m450,VADA,"It's just a question, it's not about anybody."
227345,L403117,u6747,m450,HARRY,What boy likes you?
227346,L403116,u6760,m450,VADA,"Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?"
227347,L403090,u6747,m450,HARRY,Great.
227348,L403089,u6760,m450,VADA,Seriously.
227349,L403088,u6747,m450,HARRY,Seriously?
227350,L403087,u6760,m450,VADA,"Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room."
227351,L403086,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer."
227352,L403085,u6760,m450,VADA,"Don't do that, you've got the whole garage."
227353,L403084,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard."
227354,L403083,u6760,m450,VADA,"Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room."
227355,L403082,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada."
227356,L403081,u6760,m450,VADA,"No it's okay, I understand, really."
227357,L403080,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere."
227358,L403078,u6760,m450,VADA,I figured you did.
227359,L403077,u6747,m450,HARRY,"She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly."
227360,L403076,u6760,m450,VADA,Shelly's already told me all about sex.
227361,L403075,u6747,m450,HARRY,"No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk."
227362,L403074,u6760,m450,VADA,"You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle."
227363,L403073,u6747,m450,HARRY,Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
227364,L403072,u6760,m450,VADA,"So, what's on your mind?"
227365,L403071,u6747,m450,HARRY,Well you know what I mean.
227366,L403070,u6760,m450,VADA,Visualize a spare?
227367,L403063,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Okay thanks, atta girl."
227368,L403062,u6760,m450,VADA,"Okay, no problem."
227369,L403061,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood."
227370,L403060,u6760,m450,VADA,You want me to move?
227371,L403059,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise...."
227372,L403058,u6760,m450,VADA,Do what?
227373,L403054,u6760,m450,VADA,I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
227374,L403053,u6747,m450,HARRY,"I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing."
227375,L403035,u6760,m450,VADA,"Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch."
227376,L403034,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more."
227377,L403901,u6747,m450,HARRY,Maybe he's hungry.
227378,L403900,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Maybe he's wet?
227379,L403893,u6758,m450,SHELLY,I was pushing as fast as I could.
227380,L403892,u6747,m450,HARRY,I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
227381,L403261,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think..."
227382,L403260,u6747,m450,HARRY,Reason? What reason?
227383,L403257,u6747,m450,HARRY,I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
227384,L403256,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here."
227385,L403255,u6747,m450,HARRY,Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
227386,L403244,u6758,m450,SHELLY,You're being narrow-minded.
227387,L403243,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree."
227388,L403242,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of..."
227389,L403241,u6747,m450,HARRY,"She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else."
227390,L403176,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree."
227391,L403175,u6758,m450,SHELLY,No.
227392,L403174,u6747,m450,HARRY,I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
227393,L403147,u6758,m450,SHELLY,And some taco chips so I can dunk.
227394,L403146,u6747,m450,HARRY,How about a nice glass of milk?
227395,L403145,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Never heard of him.
227396,L403142,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?"
227397,L403141,u6747,m450,HARRY,Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
227398,L403122,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars."
227399,L403121,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?"
227400,L403067,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too."
227401,L403066,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room."
227402,L403056,u6747,m450,HARRY,"Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to."
227403,L403055,u6758,m450,SHELLY,I don't know if I want to.
227404,L403030,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Then I'll throw up a little bit.
227405,L403029,u6747,m450,HARRY,Well you should at least try a little bit.
227406,L403028,u6758,m450,SHELLY,If I eat it I'll throw up.
227407,L403027,u6747,m450,HARRY,Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
227408,L403695,u6760,m450,VADA,"They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out."
227409,L403694,u6748,m450,HILLARY,"Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things."
227410,L403693,u6760,m450,VADA,Are you saying my mother had another husband?
227411,L403692,u6748,m450,HILLARY,"Ummmmm, look, I...I..."
227412,L403691,u6760,m450,VADA,What're you saying?
227413,L403690,u6748,m450,HILLARY,Oh.  Ohhh?
227414,L403689,u6760,m450,VADA,His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
227415,L403685,u6748,m450,HILLARY,"I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it."
227416,L403684,u6760,m450,VADA,Thanks.
227417,L403679,u6748,m450,HILLARY,"I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand."
227418,L403678,u6760,m450,VADA,"It's okay really, I was just a baby."
227419,L403675,u6748,m450,HILLARY,Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
227420,L403674,u6760,m450,VADA,Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
227421,L403832,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
227422,L403831,u6760,m450,VADA,oh.
227423,L403830,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
227424,L403829,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,"Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so."
227425,L403828,u6760,m450,VADA,Well...
227426,L403827,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
227427,L403826,u6760,m450,VADA,"I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me."
227428,L403825,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,I'd say you turned out just fine.
227429,L403824,u6760,m450,VADA,I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
227430,L403823,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
227431,L403822,u6760,m450,VADA,Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
227432,L403821,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
227433,L403820,u6760,m450,VADA,More than anything in the world.
227434,L403819,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
227435,L403817,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
227436,L403816,u6760,m450,VADA,She's beautiful.
227437,L403812,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,I've got something better.
227438,L403811,u6760,m450,VADA,Do you have any pictures if her?
227439,L403810,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,"Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did."
227440,L403809,u6760,m450,VADA,And she saved it.
227441,L403806,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,I'll try.
227442,L403805,u6760,m450,VADA,I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
227443,L403804,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,"Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience."
227444,L403803,u6760,m450,VADA,Special effects?
227445,L403802,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,"That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects."
227446,L403801,u6760,m450,VADA,I told you it was a long story.
227447,L403800,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,
227448,L403799,u6760,m450,VADA,"Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am."
227449,L403798,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
227450,L403797,u6760,m450,VADA,"We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so...."
227451,L403796,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,"Yeah, come on, let's talk."
227452,L403795,u6760,m450,VADA,You are?
227453,L403794,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,I'm glad you're here.
227454,L403793,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Does she?
227455,L403792,u6760,m450,VADA,Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
227456,L403783,u6760,m450,VADA,"I'd like to, thanks."
227457,L403782,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Umm...can you come in for a minute?
227458,L403775,u6760,m450,VADA,"You mean, you knew about me?"
227459,L403774,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
227460,L403773,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
227461,L403772,u6760,m450,VADA,I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
227462,L403771,u6749,m450,JEFFREY,"Sure am, who are you?"
227463,L403208,u6760,m450,VADA,Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
227464,L403207,u6750,m450,JUDY,"So she had you in jail, in Russia?"
227465,L403202,u6760,m450,VADA,"Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians."
227466,L403201,u6750,m450,JUDY,Then what did she do?
227467,L403128,u6750,m450,JUDY,ehh...I don't know I mean....
227468,L403127,u6760,m450,VADA,"Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?"
227469,L403126,u6750,m450,JUDY,Hi.
227470,L403107,u6750,m450,JUDY,"I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!"
227471,L403106,u6760,m450,VADA,"That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?"
227472,L403105,u6750,m450,JUDY,Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
227473,L403104,u6760,m450,VADA,Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
227474,L403103,u6750,m450,JUDY,He likes you.
227475,L403102,u6760,m450,VADA,What's the matter?
227476,L403098,u6750,m450,JUDY,"Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural."
227477,L403097,u6760,m450,VADA,See you? He can smell you from there.
227478,L403096,u6750,m450,JUDY,"It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me."
227479,L403095,u6760,m450,VADA,What are you staring at?
227480,L403093,u6760,m450,VADA,Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
227481,L403092,u6750,m450,JUDY,My mother can't have any more kids.
227482,L403050,u6760,m450,VADA,"You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??"
227483,L403049,u6750,m450,JUDY,I know that.
227484,L403048,u6760,m450,VADA,It's just a corpse.
227485,L403047,u6750,m450,JUDY,That's okay.
227486,L403046,u6760,m450,VADA,Come on in!
227487,L403045,u6750,m450,JUDY,Hi.
227488,L403206,u6760,m450,VADA,"That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world."
227489,L403205,u6751,m450,KEVIN,"All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?"
227490,L403204,u6760,m450,VADA,"No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her."
227491,L403203,u6751,m450,KEVIN,"Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??"
227492,L403200,u6760,m450,VADA,"No-one invented gravity, it just exists."
227493,L403199,u6751,m450,KEVIN,"You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?"
227494,L403198,u6760,m450,VADA,But I wanna write about her.
227495,L403197,u6751,m450,KEVIN,"Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother."
227496,L403131,u6751,m450,KEVIN,"Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl."
227497,L403130,u6760,m450,VADA,"It's okay with me, hi Kevin."
227498,L403129,u6751,m450,KEVIN,Is it okay if I drink this?
227499,L403445,u6756,m450,ROSE,Rose.

227519,L403195,u6760,m450,VADA,"Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too."
227520,L403194,u6753,m450,MR. OWETT,"You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life."
227521,L403193,u6760,m450,VADA,"Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start."

227523,L403172,u6760,m450,VADA,I never met my mother.
227524,L403171,u6753,m450,MR. OWETT,Your mother?
227525,L403170,u6760,m450,VADA,My mother.
227526,L403169,u6753,m450,MR. OWETT,"Vada what about you, who have you come up with?"
227527,L403163,u6760,m450,VADA,The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
227528,L403162,u6753,m450,MR. OWETT,Vada?
227529,L403637,u6756,m450,ROSE,You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.

227554,L403864,u6760,m450,VADA,You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
227555,L403863,u6754,m450,NICK,Some sacrifices are worth it.

227558,L403833,u6760,m450,VADA,And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.

227573,L403626,u6760,m450,VADA,"Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married."

227583,L403614,u6754,m450,NICK,Big deal.
227584,L403613,u6760,m450,VADA,That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
227585,L403612,u6754,m450,NICK,I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
227586,L403611,u6760,m450,VADA,My mother stood on this very spot.

227614,L403551,u6754,m450,NICK,Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
227615,L403550,u6760,m450,VADA,"ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value."
227616,L403549,u6754,m450,NICK,Let me see if it changes colors on me.
227617,L403548,u6760,m450,VADA,"Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time."
227618,L403547,u6754,m450,NICK,"Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?"
227619,L403546,u6760,m450,VADA,"Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch."
227620,L403545,u6754,m450,NICK,Boyfriend?
227621,L403544,u6760,m450,VADA,"Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine."
227622,L403543,u6754,m450,NICK,Does it work?
227623,L403542,u6760,m450,VADA,This isn't just a mood ring.
227624,L403541,u6754,m450,NICK,"Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring."
227625,L403540,u6760,m450,VADA,"Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here."
227626,L403539,u6754,m450,NICK,You are weird. Let's just go.
227627,L403538,u6760,m450,VADA,And I thought I was weird.
227628,L403537,u6754,m450,NICK,"Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar."
227629,L403515,u6760,m450,VADA,At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
227630,L403514,u6754,m450,NICK,If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
227631,L403503,u6760,m450,VADA,He is one of the great poets.

227634,L403477,u6754,m450,NICK,Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
227635,L403434,u6754,m450,NICK,You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
227636,L403433,u6760,m450,VADA,You would.
227637,L403432,u6754,m450,NICK,I think it's cool.
227638,L403431,u6760,m450,VADA,"This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking."
227639,L403430,u6754,m450,NICK,Care for a smoke?
227640,L403424,u6754,m450,NICK,Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
227641,L403423,u6760,m450,VADA,You ratted on my mother??

227644,L403405,u6760,m450,VADA,Why do you argue with everything I say?
227645,L403404,u6754,m450,NICK,What if you don't wanna be found?
227646,L403403,u6760,m450,VADA,"I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them."
227647,L403402,u6754,m450,NICK,"What, you think the guy should change his name?"
227648,L403401,u6760,m450,VADA,Change my name.
227649,L403400,u6754,m450,NICK,Get married?
227650,L403399,u6760,m450,VADA,I'd never do that.
227651,L403398,u6754,m450,NICK,"Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married."
227652,L403395,u6754,m450,NICK,I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
227653,L403394,u6760,m450,VADA,"It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books."
227654,L403393,u6754,m450,NICK,"Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here."
227655,L403392,u6760,m450,VADA,"Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous."
227656,L403391,u6760,m450,VADA,"Oh my gosh, here it is!"
227657,L403390,u6754,m450,NICK,"A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time."
227658,L403389,u6760,m450,VADA,What difference does it make?
227659,L403388,u6754,m450,NICK,"I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?"
227660,L403387,u6760,m450,VADA,Just remember the needle in the haystack.
227661,L403386,u6754,m450,NICK,"I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude."
227662,L403378,u6754,m450,NICK,"Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from."
227663,L403377,u6760,m450,VADA,WHAT??
227664,L403376,u6754,m450,NICK,Vada.
227665,L403375,u6760,m450,VADA,It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
227666,L403374,u6754,m450,NICK,They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
227667,L403371,u6760,m450,VADA,"Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me."
227668,L403370,u6754,m450,NICK,Getting off please.
227669,L403369,u6760,m450,VADA,"Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here."
227670,L403368,u6754,m450,NICK,"I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me."
227671,L403367,u6760,m450,VADA,"I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing."
227672,L403366,u6754,m450,NICK,You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
227673,L403346,u6760,m450,VADA,"I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were."
227674,L403345,u6754,m450,NICK,And you're gonna solve the mystery?
227675,L403344,u6760,m450,VADA,"My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day."
227676,L403306,u6754,m450,NICK,TAXI!!!
227677,L403305,u6760,m450,VADA,I don't need you to be telling me to...
227678,L403304,u6754,m450,NICK,"Yeah, RIGHT."
227679,L403303,u6760,m450,VADA,He said it was a gift.
227680,L403302,u6754,m450,NICK,No THANKS!
227681,L403301,u6760,m450,VADA,Thanks....
227682,L403363,u6754,m450,NICK,"Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off"
227683,L403362,u6755,m450,PHIL,You're a good man Nicholas.
227684,L403361,u6754,m450,NICK,No problem.
227685,L403360,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though."
227686,L403359,u6754,m450,NICK,Wow!
227687,L403358,u6755,m450,PHIL,For the mini-bike fund.
227688,L403357,u6754,m450,NICK,What's it for?
227689,L403356,u6755,m450,PHIL,Ten bucks.
227690,L403355,u6754,m450,NICK,What's that?
227691,L403352,u6755,m450,PHIL,I'd consider it a personal favor.
227692,L403351,u6754,m450,NICK,Muh??
227693,L403848,u6755,m450,PHIL,Rose this not the place to be having this...
227694,L403847,u6757,m450,SAM,I don't think the color of the interior is....
227695,L403846,u6755,m450,PHIL,"You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice."
227696,L403845,u6757,m450,SAM,And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
227697,L403841,u6757,m450,SAM,"Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?"
227698,L403840,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement."
227699,L403839,u6757,m450,SAM,"I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist."
227700,L403838,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and...."
227701,L403659,u6757,m450,SAM,"Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here."
227702,L403658,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles."
227703,L403463,u6755,m450,PHIL,Was Rose.
227704,L403462,u6757,m450,SAM,Well Rose was being very thorough.
227705,L403858,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me."
227706,L403857,u6760,m450,VADA,"Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly."
227707,L403856,u6755,m450,PHIL,"No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane."
227708,L403767,u6760,m450,VADA,Okay.
227709,L403766,u6755,m450,PHIL,Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
227710,L403765,u6760,m450,VADA,I should do this myself.
227711,L403764,u6755,m450,PHIL,You want me to come with?
227712,L403763,u6760,m450,VADA,"Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door."
227713,L403762,u6755,m450,PHIL,This is it I guess.
227714,L403761,u6760,m450,VADA,"A secret, I like that."
227715,L403760,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom."
227716,L403759,u6760,m450,VADA,Maybe.
227717,L403758,u6755,m450,PHIL,"I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now."
227718,L403757,u6760,m450,VADA,Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
227719,L403754,u6755,m450,PHIL,Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
227720,L403753,u6760,m450,VADA,I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
227721,L403752,u6755,m450,PHIL,"How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself...."
227722,L403751,u6760,m450,VADA,I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
227723,L403710,u6760,m450,VADA,"Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way."
227724,L403709,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou..."
227725,L403604,u6760,m450,VADA,Bye.
227726,L403603,u6755,m450,PHIL,Lock the door.
227727,L403350,u6755,m450,PHIL,I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
227728,L403349,u6760,m450,VADA,"I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and...."
227729,L403341,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances."
227730,L403340,u6760,m450,VADA,Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
227731,L403339,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Yes, it does."
227732,L403338,u6760,m450,VADA,So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
227733,L403337,u6755,m450,PHIL,Committed.
227734,L403336,u6760,m450,VADA,Committed?
227735,L403335,u6755,m450,PHIL,"That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?"
227736,L403334,u6760,m450,VADA,"Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil."
227737,L403333,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip."
227738,L403332,u6760,m450,VADA,But...are you engaged or something?
227739,L403331,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh...."
227740,L403330,u6760,m450,VADA,She lives here too?
227741,L403317,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note"
227742,L403316,u6760,m450,VADA,"He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars."
227743,L403315,u6755,m450,PHIL,How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
227744,L403314,u6760,m450,VADA,They're great.
227745,L403313,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?"
227746,L403853,u6755,m450,PHIL,Is that a yes?
227747,L403852,u6756,m450,ROSE,You really think I look sexy in this smock?
227748,L403851,u6756,m450,ROSE,You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
227749,L403850,u6755,m450,PHIL,You know how I feel about you.
227750,L403849,u6756,m450,ROSE,I think this place is just fine.
227751,L403844,u6756,m450,ROSE,I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
227752,L403843,u6755,m450,PHIL,You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
227753,L403842,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have."
227754,L403669,u6756,m450,ROSE,"No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook."
227755,L403668,u6755,m450,PHIL,Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
227756,L403667,u6756,m450,ROSE,"I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?"
227757,L403666,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?"
227758,L403598,u6755,m450,PHIL,You know where the fire extinguisher is.
227759,L403597,u6756,m450,ROSE,There's plenty of fruit.
227760,L403596,u6755,m450,PHIL,We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
227761,L403480,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children."
227762,L403479,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself."
227763,L403476,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?"
227764,L403475,u6755,m450,PHIL,Hi!
227765,L403474,u6756,m450,ROSE,Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
227766,L403473,u6755,m450,PHIL,Oh...what's that?
227767,L403472,u6755,m450,PHIL,"God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are."
227768,L403471,u6756,m450,ROSE,Phil for God sake.
227769,L403470,u6755,m450,PHIL,He was caressing.
227770,L403469,u6756,m450,ROSE,He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
227771,L403468,u6755,m450,PHIL,"What's with the touching, why was he touching you?"
227772,L403461,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation."
227773,L403460,u6756,m450,ROSE,"No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed."
227774,L403348,u6756,m450,ROSE,Sounds like you're very organized.
227775,L403347,u6755,m450,PHIL,Then you'll be all set.
227776,L403328,u6755,m450,PHIL,Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
227777,L403327,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?"
227778,L403326,u6755,m450,PHIL,"Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life."
227779,L403860,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Bye Niece, Vada."
227780,L403859,u6760,m450,VADA,Bye Aunt Rose.
227781,L403730,u6760,m450,VADA,"Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry."
227782,L403729,u6756,m450,ROSE,She'll be all right baby.
227783,L403728,u6760,m450,VADA,Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
227784,L403642,u6756,m450,ROSE,Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
227785,L403641,u6760,m450,VADA,Not exactly.
227786,L403640,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?"
227787,L403602,u6756,m450,ROSE,"All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye."
227788,L403601,u6760,m450,VADA,I'm just tired.
227789,L403324,u6756,m450,ROSE,"What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut."
227790,L403323,u6760,m450,VADA,You're Nick's mother?
227791,L403663,u6757,m450,SAM,I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
227792,L403662,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Oh, sure okay."
227793,L403661,u6757,m450,SAM,"Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me."
227794,L403657,u6757,m450,SAM,Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
227795,L403656,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian."
227796,L403655,u6757,m450,SAM,"All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites."
227797,L403654,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry."
227798,L403653,u6757,m450,SAM,"Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry."
227799,L403652,u6756,m450,ROSE,Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
227800,L403651,u6757,m450,SAM,Sort of?
227801,L403650,u6756,m450,ROSE,Well I'm sort of involved.
227802,L403649,u6757,m450,SAM,You couldn't?
227803,L403648,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't."
227804,L403647,u6757,m450,SAM,"Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax."
227805,L403646,u6756,m450,ROSE,Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
227806,L403645,u6757,m450,SAM,Something wrong?
227807,L403644,u6756,m450,ROSE,Well maybe for you.
227808,L403643,u6757,m450,SAM,Good morning.
227809,L403465,u6757,m450,SAM,I'll be here.
227810,L403464,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started."
227811,L403458,u6757,m450,SAM,"...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation..."
227812,L403457,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Yes, I do."
227813,L403456,u6757,m450,SAM,"...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?"
227814,L403455,u6757,m450,SAM,"Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively."
227815,L403454,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?"
227816,L403453,u6757,m450,SAM,I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
227817,L403452,u6756,m450,ROSE,"Oh, are you a hairdresser?"
227818,L403451,u6757,m450,SAM,I was commenting on your hair.
227819,L403450,u6756,m450,ROSE,Excuse me?
227820,L403449,u6757,m450,SAM,"Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair."
227821,L403448,u6756,m450,ROSE,I mean...with your car.
227822,L403447,u6757,m450,SAM,"Nothing, nothing at all."
227823,L403446,u6756,m450,ROSE,So what's wrong?
227824,L403899,u6758,m450,SHELLY,O.K.
227825,L403898,u6760,m450,VADA,Let me hold him.
227826,L403895,u6758,m450,SHELLY,You have no idea.
227827,L403894,u6760,m450,VADA,Did it hurt a lot?
227828,L403891,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"I know, look at his little hands."
227829,L403890,u6760,m450,VADA,He's so tiny.
227830,L403889,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Hey! Oh look.
227831,L403888,u6760,m450,VADA,Shelly?
227832,L403238,u6758,m450,SHELLY,You leave your father to me.
227833,L403237,u6760,m450,VADA,But Dad'll never go for it.
227834,L403236,u6758,m450,SHELLY,It would be fantastic.
227835,L403235,u6760,m450,VADA,"Yeah, it would be kinda great."
227836,L403234,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so."
227837,L403233,u6760,m450,VADA,But what about you and the baby? You need me.
227838,L403232,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom."
227839,L403231,u6760,m450,VADA,What do you mean?
227840,L403230,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Why not now?
227841,L403229,u6760,m450,VADA,I'm definitely traveling some day.
227842,L403228,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Well you've gotta be prepared.
227843,L403227,u6760,m450,VADA,I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
227844,L403226,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure."
227845,L403225,u6760,m450,VADA,Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
227846,L403224,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning."
227847,L403223,u6760,m450,VADA,"Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?"
227848,L403222,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
227849,L403221,u6760,m450,VADA,"This is one of my favorite things, her passport."
227850,L403220,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental."
227851,L403219,u6760,m450,VADA,"I don't know, Dad doesn't either."
227852,L403218,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"What's this? December 8th, 1958?"
227853,L403185,u6760,m450,VADA,"Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all."
227854,L403184,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
227855,L403178,u6758,m450,SHELLY,Oh no.
227856,L403177,u6760,m450,VADA,"Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house."
227857,L403156,u6760,m450,VADA,You're telling me.
227858,L403155,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman."
227859,L403154,u6760,m450,VADA,Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
227860,L403153,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had."
227861,L403152,u6760,m450,VADA,"When did you umm, I mean umm..."
227862,L403151,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"No, the milk comes when the baby comes."
227863,L403150,u6760,m450,VADA,Is there milk in them already?
227864,L403149,u6758,m450,SHELLY,"They're enormous, I know."
227865,L403140,u6758,m450,SHELLY,I bet your mom sang to you.
227866,L403139,u6760,m450,VADA,Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
227867,L403501,u6760,m450,VADA,This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
227868,L403500,u6759,m450,STANLEY,I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
227869,L403499,u6760,m450,VADA,"Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time."
227870,L403498,u6759,m450,STANLEY,No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
227871,L403496,u6760,m450,VADA,"He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?"
227872,L403495,u6759,m450,STANLEY,"Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon."
227873,L403494,u6760,m450,VADA,Do you know him?
227874,L403493,u6759,m450,STANLEY,He is?
227875,L403492,u6760,m450,VADA,He's a great poet.
227876,L403491,u6759,m450,STANLEY,"Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man."
227877,L403490,u6760,m450,VADA,Beidermeyer?
227878,L403489,u6759,m450,STANLEY,"Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no."
227879,L403488,u6760,m450,VADA,Really?
227880,L402249,u6761,m451,ARTHUR,"No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me."
227881,L402248,u6772,m451,VADA,Wanna play?
227882,L402096,u6761,m451,ARTHUR,I like to buy off all the railroads.
227883,L402095,u6772,m451,VADA,Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
227884,L402094,u6761,m451,ARTHUR,Good for you baby.
227885,L402093,u6772,m451,VADA,I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.

227887,L402091,u6772,m451,VADA,Arthur!!
227888,L402076,u6772,m451,VADA,"Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy."
227889,L402075,u6762,m451,BOY#2,Of what??
227890,L402067,u6762,m451,BOY#2,"All right, here."

227893,L402064,u6772,m451,VADA,"Hey, you didn't pay me!"
227894,L402063,u6772,m451,VADA,"Leave him alone! Come on, let's go."
227895,L402062,u6762,m451,BOY#2,"Yeah, to play with his DOLLS."

227900,L402629,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever."

227934,L402158,u6772,m451,VADA,"That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms."
227935,L402157,u6764,m451,DR WELTY,You are perfectly healthy.
227936,L402923,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter."
227937,L402922,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive."
227938,L402921,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;"
227939,L402920,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I know that, but what do you want from me?"
227940,L402919,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead."
227941,L402730,u6765,m451,HARRY,I don't know which ball's mine.
227942,L402729,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Perfect.
227943,L402728,u6765,m451,HARRY,Watch you don't knock out a fish.
227944,L402655,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
227945,L402654,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Did you ahh, love him?"
227946,L402653,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Pointing upwards Look...
227947,L402652,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year..."
227948,L402651,u6765,m451,HARRY,You can get the general idea...
227949,L402650,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Can we see it from the back yard?
227950,L402649,u6765,m451,HARRY,Is it really your camper?
227951,L402648,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Well, you were pretty great!"
227952,L402632,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper."
227953,L402631,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
227954,L402625,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise....."
227955,L402624,u6765,m451,HARRY,Shelly?
227956,L402594,u6765,m451,HARRY,I'll second that.
227957,L402593,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God."
227958,L402584,u6765,m451,HARRY,Okay.
227959,L402583,u6770,m451,SHELLY,How's it going chef?
227960,L402572,u6765,m451,HARRY,Really?
227961,L402571,u6770,m451,SHELLY,You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
227962,L402568,u6765,m451,HARRY,I'm looking forward to that.
227963,L402567,u6770,m451,SHELLY,It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
227964,L402566,u6765,m451,HARRY,Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
227965,L402565,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?"
227966,L402564,u6765,m451,HARRY,I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
227967,L402545,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Goodnight.
227968,L402544,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours."
227969,L402541,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Goodnight.
227970,L402540,u6765,m451,HARRY,Goodnight Shelly.
227971,L402539,u6770,m451,SHELLY,It's only eight o'clock.
227972,L402538,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I ahh, better go."
227973,L402536,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Good.
227974,L402535,u6765,m451,HARRY,Yes.
227975,L402534,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Kiss me.
227976,L402533,u6765,m451,HARRY,Want to what?
227977,L402532,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Do you want to?
227978,L402531,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic."
227979,L402530,u6770,m451,SHELLY,What are you wearing?
227980,L402529,u6765,m451,HARRY,"At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue."
227981,L402528,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good."
227982,L402527,u6765,m451,HARRY,Rock?
227983,L402526,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"In ages, I know, me neither."
227984,L402525,u6765,m451,HARRY,I haven't danced in.....
227985,L402524,u6765,m451,HARRY,Is there enough room?
227986,L402523,u6770,m451,SHELLY,This is where we are.
227987,L402522,u6765,m451,HARRY,Here?
227988,L402521,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Dance with me?
227989,L402520,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was....."
227990,L402519,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Did she ever see Vada?
227991,L402518,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born."
227992,L402517,u6770,m451,SHELLY,What happened to her?
227993,L402516,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died."
227994,L402515,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and..."
227995,L402514,u6765,m451,HARRY,"No, why?"
227996,L402513,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Are you mad at me?
227997,L402512,u6765,m451,HARRY,Yeah.
227998,L402511,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush."
227999,L402510,u6765,m451,HARRY,Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
228000,L402509,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
228001,L402508,u6765,m451,HARRY,It's nice.
228002,L402507,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Home sweet home.
228003,L402506,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Okay, sure."
228004,L402505,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
228005,L402504,u6765,m451,HARRY,I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
228006,L402503,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I had a good time tonight.
228007,L402492,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want."
228008,L402491,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Oh, how do you mean?"
228009,L402490,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Kinda like men.
228010,L402489,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100."
228011,L402488,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry."
228012,L402484,u6765,m451,HARRY,Why d'you think these seats were empty.
228013,L402483,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
228014,L402482,u6765,m451,HARRY,What's that?
228015,L402481,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I just had a terrible thought Harry.
228016,L402471,u6765,m451,HARRY,"No. Just, more activity."
228017,L402470,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Does it make it easier to win?
228018,L402379,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Okay.
228019,L402378,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to."
228020,L402377,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work."
228021,L402376,u6765,m451,HARRY,I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
228022,L402375,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?"
228023,L402374,u6765,m451,HARRY,It's no big deal.
228024,L402373,u6770,m451,SHELLY,In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
228025,L402372,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity."
228026,L402371,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu."
228027,L402370,u6770,m451,SHELLY,No kidding?
228028,L402369,u6765,m451,HARRY,I wrote that.
228029,L402368,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society."
228030,L402367,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family."
228031,L402366,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing."
228032,L402365,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Oh Hi, what can I do for you?"
228033,L402364,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Hi.
228034,L402338,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I'm sure she will.
228035,L402337,u6765,m451,HARRY,"After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though."
228036,L402336,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much."
228037,L402335,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh."
228038,L402334,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up."
228039,L402333,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Can not do without, Harry's wild about me."
228040,L402272,u6765,m451,HARRY,"She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?"
228041,L402271,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Harry, I really think she....."
228042,L402270,u6765,m451,HARRY,"She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it."
228043,L402269,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I don't think so, I think she's confused about death."
228044,L402268,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Oh that, she just likes to play."
228045,L402267,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Well the other night at dinner...
228046,L402266,u6765,m451,HARRY,What do you mean??
228047,L402265,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada."
228048,L402264,u6765,m451,HARRY,That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
228049,L402263,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
228050,L402262,u6765,m451,HARRY,She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
228051,L402261,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972."
228052,L402260,u6765,m451,HARRY,"This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker."
228053,L402259,u6770,m451,SHELLY,You don't like it?
228054,L402257,u6765,m451,HARRY,Yeah.
228055,L402256,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
228056,L402255,u6765,m451,HARRY,Uh huh?
228057,L402147,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks."
228058,L402146,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the...."
228059,L402145,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal."
228060,L402144,u6765,m451,HARRY,You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
228061,L402143,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common."
228062,L402142,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh..."
228063,L402141,u6770,m451,SHELLY,I need the job.
228064,L402140,u6765,m451,HARRY,Pardon?
228065,L402139,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Excuse me, what about the job?"
228066,L402123,u6770,m451,SHELLY,The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
228067,L402122,u6765,m451,HARRY,Deceased.
228068,L402121,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Stiffs??
228069,L402120,u6765,m451,HARRY,Yes they are.
228070,L402119,u6770,m451,SHELLY,They're dead?
228071,L402118,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor."
228072,L402117,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease."
228073,L402116,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Uhh, Miss devoto..."
228074,L402115,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving."
228075,L402114,u6765,m451,HARRY,I think it's still available.
228076,L402113,u6770,m451,SHELLY,It's still available I hope?
228077,L403001,u6765,m451,HARRY,"That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning."
228078,L403000,u6772,m451,VADA,I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
228079,L402999,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked."
228080,L402998,u6772,m451,VADA,Do you miss her?
228081,L402997,u6765,m451,HARRY,Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
228082,L402996,u6772,m451,VADA,Really?
228083,L402995,u6765,m451,HARRY,"She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her."
228084,L402994,u6772,m451,VADA,What was my mama like?
228085,L402993,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car."
228086,L402992,u6772,m451,VADA,In the garage.
228087,L402991,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?"
228088,L402990,u6772,m451,VADA,I found this.
228089,L402988,u6765,m451,HARRY,"No, no."
228090,L402987,u6772,m451,VADA,"The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother."
228091,L402986,u6765,m451,HARRY,What??
228092,L402985,u6772,m451,VADA,Did I kill my mother?
228093,L402936,u6772,m451,VADA,"Get away, get away!!"
228094,L402935,u6765,m451,HARRY,He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
228095,L402891,u6765,m451,HARRY,There were just too many of 'em.
228096,L402890,u6772,m451,VADA,He's okay isn't he?
228097,L402889,u6765,m451,HARRY,He was allergic to bees.
228098,L402888,u6772,m451,VADA,Why not?
228099,L402887,u6765,m451,HARRY,"No sweetheart, you can't."
228100,L402886,u6772,m451,VADA,Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
228101,L402885,u6772,m451,VADA,I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
228102,L402884,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive."
228103,L402883,u6765,m451,HARRY,"He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute."
228104,L402882,u6772,m451,VADA,Yes.
228105,L402881,u6765,m451,HARRY,Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
228106,L402880,u6772,m451,VADA,Feeding my fish.
228107,L402879,u6765,m451,HARRY,What are you doing.
228108,L402878,u6772,m451,VADA,Hi.
228109,L402877,u6765,m451,HARRY,Hi Vada.
228110,L402747,u6772,m451,VADA,I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
228111,L402746,u6765,m451,HARRY,I fall asleep at the wheel.
228112,L402741,u6772,m451,VADA,Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
228113,L402740,u6765,m451,HARRY,We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
228114,L402721,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride."
228115,L402720,u6772,m451,VADA,I like the freak show.
228116,L402716,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes."

228124,L402574,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today."
228125,L402573,u6772,m451,VADA,"Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?"
228126,L402570,u6772,m451,VADA,Sorry.

228129,L402455,u6772,m451,VADA,Can I go too?
228130,L402454,u6765,m451,HARRY,She likes to play bingo.
228131,L402453,u6772,m451,VADA,Why?
228132,L402452,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together."
228133,L402451,u6772,m451,VADA,You never cared before.
228134,L402450,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Ahh, I just wanna look nice."
228135,L402449,u6772,m451,VADA,"Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?"
228136,L402448,u6765,m451,HARRY,Goodnight Vada.

228143,L402239,u6765,m451,HARRY,Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
228144,L402238,u6772,m451,VADA,Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
228145,L402237,u6765,m451,HARRY,Any more soda left?
228146,L402236,u6772,m451,VADA,"It's for school, for summer writing class."
228147,L402235,u6765,m451,HARRY,That's a lot of money for a little girl.
228148,L402234,u6772,m451,VADA,"Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?"
228149,L402137,u6772,m451,VADA,Then who's it for?
228150,L402136,u6765,m451,HARRY,Of course not.
228151,L402135,u6772,m451,VADA,Is it for a child?
228152,L402134,u6765,m451,HARRY,"They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes."
228153,L402133,u6772,m451,VADA,"Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?"
228154,L402102,u6765,m451,HARRY,"I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle....."
228155,L402101,u6772,m451,VADA,Dad?

228157,L402099,u6765,m451,HARRY,Hand me the canula.
228158,L402098,u6772,m451,VADA,"Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!"
228159,L402097,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Vada, we're trying to work here."
228160,L402089,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Ya, that rack holds six ties."
228161,L402088,u6772,m451,VADA,Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
228162,L402087,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Vada, just put 'em on the stool."
228163,L402086,u6772,m451,VADA,Ahem.
228164,L402056,u6765,m451,HARRY,"O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge."
228165,L402055,u6772,m451,VADA,"I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying."
228166,L402582,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!"
228167,L402581,u6769,m451,PHIL,"No, no no...."
228168,L402580,u6765,m451,HARRY,That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
228169,L402579,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them."
228170,L402447,u6769,m451,PHIL,Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
228171,L402446,u6765,m451,HARRY,"No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?"
228172,L402445,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track."
228173,L402444,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute."
228174,L402443,u6769,m451,PHIL,Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
228175,L402442,u6765,m451,HARRY,Are you sure about all this?
228176,L402441,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry."
228177,L402440,u6765,m451,HARRY,Oh come on.
228178,L402439,u6769,m451,PHIL,"That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!"
228179,L402438,u6765,m451,HARRY,The last date I had was twenty years ago.
228180,L402437,u6769,m451,PHIL,Why?
228181,L402436,u6765,m451,HARRY,I'm very nervous.
228182,L402435,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Oh yes, oh that's great."
228183,L402433,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?"
228184,L402432,u6765,m451,HARRY,"Nothing, I'm dressing."
228185,L402431,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Well well well, what's going on in here?"
228186,L402910,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Bye.
228187,L402909,u6766,m451,JUDY,Thank you. Bye.
228188,L402908,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Sure.
228189,L402907,u6766,m451,JUDY,Will you tell her I came by?
228190,L402906,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
228191,L402905,u6766,m451,JUDY,"Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J."
228192,L402904,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone."
228193,L402903,u6766,m451,JUDY,"Hi, is Vada home?"
228194,L402902,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Hi.
228195,L403020,u6772,m451,VADA,"Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart."
228196,L403019,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,We'd love to hear it.
228197,L403018,u6772,m451,VADA,"I can't stay, I just came to read my poem."
228198,L402957,u6772,m451,VADA,Get away from me!
228199,L402956,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't....."
228200,L402955,u6772,m451,VADA,No....
228201,L402954,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
228202,L402953,u6772,m451,VADA,Who's that?
228203,L402947,u6772,m451,VADA,"No he wouldn't, I can't go home."
228204,L402946,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
228205,L402945,u6772,m451,VADA,I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
228206,L402944,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Oh, Vada..."
228207,L402943,u6772,m451,VADA,"Mr. Bixler,  I love you."
228208,L402942,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Come here, sit down over here."
228209,L402941,u6772,m451,VADA,Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
228210,L402940,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?"
228211,L402328,u6772,m451,VADA,"Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode."
228212,L402327,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,Please.
228213,L402326,u6772,m451,VADA,I wrote a poem too.
228214,L402325,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada."
228215,L402318,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Vada, this is an adult writing class."
228216,L402317,u6772,m451,VADA,"Uh huh, I wanna be a writer."
228217,L402316,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,For this class?
228218,L402315,u6772,m451,VADA,I paid the money.
228219,L402189,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
228220,L402188,u6772,m451,VADA,"No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace."
228221,L402187,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?"
228222,L402186,u6772,m451,VADA,What do you get for that?
228223,L402185,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,Thirty five dollars.
228224,L402184,u6772,m451,VADA,How much does it cost?
228225,L402183,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work."
228226,L402182,u6772,m451,VADA,How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
228227,L402181,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet."
228228,L402180,u6772,m451,VADA,This is one big house for one single person.
228229,L402179,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,"Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up."
228230,L402178,u6772,m451,VADA,"Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?"
228231,L402175,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
228232,L402174,u6772,m451,VADA,"Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun."
228233,L402173,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
228234,L402172,u6772,m451,VADA,"It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading."
228235,L402171,u6767,m451,MR. BIXLER,Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
228236,L402686,u6768,m451,NURSE RANDALL,You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
228237,L402685,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared."
228238,L402684,u6768,m451,NURSE RANDALL,Why do you think she says that?
228239,L402683,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,No.
228240,L402682,u6768,m451,NURSE RANDALL,Do you think she is?
228241,L402681,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Cause she's dying.
228242,L402680,u6768,m451,NURSE RANDALL,"Oh yes, yes."
228243,L402679,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Cool, can I get one for Vada?"
228244,L402678,u6768,m451,NURSE RANDALL,"So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun."
228245,L402667,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh."
228246,L402666,u6772,m451,VADA,My Dad was funny?
228247,L402665,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry."
228248,L402664,u6772,m451,VADA,Really?
228249,L402663,u6769,m451,PHIL,"After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny."
228250,L402662,u6772,m451,VADA,Why?
228251,L402661,u6769,m451,PHIL,"Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father."
228252,L402660,u6772,m451,VADA,Do you like her?
228253,L402659,u6769,m451,PHIL,Probably.
228254,L402658,u6772,m451,VADA,Does he love her?
228255,L402657,u6769,m451,PHIL,He likes her.
228256,L402656,u6772,m451,VADA,"He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life."
228257,L402983,u6772,m451,VADA,Goodnight.
228258,L402982,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Goodnight.
228259,L402981,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Okay, get in to bed."
228260,L402980,u6772,m451,VADA,I will I promise.
228261,L402979,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing."
228262,L402978,u6772,m451,VADA,"I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again."
228263,L402977,u6770,m451,SHELLY,It's okay sweetheart.
228264,L402818,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently."
228265,L402817,u6772,m451,VADA,I think it should be outlawed.
228266,L402816,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada."
228267,L402815,u6772,m451,VADA,My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
228268,L402814,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk."
228269,L402813,u6772,m451,VADA,I'm eleven and a half.
228270,L402812,u6770,m451,SHELLY,How old are you?
228271,L402810,u6772,m451,VADA,"I don't want, I don't need your help...."
228272,L402809,u6770,m451,SHELLY,What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
228273,L402808,u6772,m451,VADA,I'm hemorrhaging.
228274,L402807,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Well he just left, what's wrong?"
228275,L402806,u6772,m451,VADA,Where's Daddy?
228276,L402805,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Vada, Vada, what's the matter?"
228277,L402804,u6772,m451,VADA,Daddy??!?!?!
228278,L402751,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Yes!!
228279,L402750,u6772,m451,VADA,NO!
228280,L402743,u6772,m451,VADA,"NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish."
228281,L402742,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
228282,L402732,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Oh great!!
228283,L402731,u6772,m451,VADA,"I won, I won!!!"
228284,L402724,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine."
228285,L402723,u6772,m451,VADA,"Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs."
228286,L402722,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis."
228287,L402619,u6772,m451,VADA,Are you here to take Shelly back?
228288,L402618,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married."
228289,L402617,u6772,m451,VADA,I like my name.
228290,L402597,u6772,m451,VADA,See food!
228291,L402596,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Uh huh, why?"
228292,L402595,u6772,m451,VADA,"Hey Shelly, like seafood?"
228293,L402563,u6772,m451,VADA,Hi.
228294,L402562,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada."
228295,L402480,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Aarrggh.
228296,L402479,u6772,m451,VADA,"Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me."
228297,L402397,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes."
228298,L402396,u6772,m451,VADA,Do you like putting makeup on people?
228299,L402395,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow."
228300,L402394,u6772,m451,VADA,The boys at school don't think I am.
228301,L402393,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth."
228302,L402392,u6772,m451,VADA,"Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?"
228303,L402389,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Come here, sit down."
228304,L402388,u6772,m451,VADA,No.
228305,L402387,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Have you ever tried any?
228306,L402386,u6772,m451,VADA,"I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color."
228307,L402385,u6770,m451,SHELLY,A girl's always gotta look her best.
228308,L402384,u6772,m451,VADA,So how come you're putting lipstick on?
228309,L402383,u6770,m451,SHELLY,No.
228310,L402382,u6772,m451,VADA,Are you going out somewhere?
228311,L402310,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Okay.
228312,L402309,u6772,m451,VADA,"You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late."
228313,L402308,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Sure.
228314,L402307,u6772,m451,VADA,Can I use your bathroom first?
228315,L402306,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?"
228316,L402298,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other."
228317,L402297,u6772,m451,VADA,Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
228318,L402296,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"No, I'm divorced."
228319,L402295,u6772,m451,VADA,Are you married?
228320,L402292,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Mostly love, and romance."
228321,L402291,u6772,m451,VADA,What are they about?
228322,L402290,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Uh huh.
228323,L402289,u6772,m451,VADA,Did you read ALL these books?
228324,L402285,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Thomas?
228325,L402284,u6772,m451,VADA,I would.
228326,L402283,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?"
228327,L402282,u6772,m451,VADA,Big Ringo fan.
228328,L402277,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
228329,L402276,u6772,m451,VADA,Can we look around in your camper?
228330,L402275,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Hi.
228331,L402252,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Come on sweetie.
228332,L402251,u6772,m451,VADA,"My ball, I lost my ball."
228333,L402250,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Vada? VADA?? What happened??
228334,L402232,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Well you don't know that. Ask him.
228335,L402231,u6772,m451,VADA,He won't give it to me.
228336,L402230,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?"
228337,L402229,u6772,m451,VADA,Shut your big fat mouth!
228338,L402225,u6772,m451,VADA,"I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?"
228339,L402224,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Maybe black means you're happy?
228340,L402221,u6772,m451,VADA,"It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in."
228341,L402220,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing."
228342,L402219,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Chocolate?
228343,L402218,u6772,m451,VADA,He's allergic to everything.
228344,L402213,u6772,m451,VADA,I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
228345,L402212,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you."
228346,L402202,u6772,m451,VADA,I am.
228347,L402201,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Who's winning?
228348,L402130,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Oh.
228349,L402129,u6772,m451,VADA,She's shy.
228350,L402127,u6772,m451,VADA,That's really cool.
228351,L402126,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Yes it is.
228352,L402125,u6772,m451,VADA,Is that your camper?
228353,L402478,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
228354,L402477,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Oh great!
228355,L402304,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day."
228356,L402303,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,What are you saving for?
228357,L402302,u6770,m451,SHELLY,"Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place."
228358,L402294,u6770,m451,SHELLY,They're just fun to read.
228359,L402293,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Eeeeuuuww, gross."
228360,L402281,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Liverpool?
228361,L402280,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
228362,L402279,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Uh huh.
228363,L402278,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?"
228364,L402217,u6770,m451,SHELLY,To chocolate?
228365,L402216,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I'm allergic to it.
228366,L402215,u6770,m451,SHELLY,Thomas J?
228367,L402871,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
228368,L402870,u6772,m451,VADA,For what?
228369,L402869,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Would you think of me?
228370,L402868,u6772,m451,VADA,What?
228371,L402867,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Okay, seeya.  Vada?"
228372,L402866,u6772,m451,VADA,Seeya tomorrow.
228373,L402865,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Okay.
228374,L402864,u6772,m451,VADA,"Well, let's spit on it."
228375,L402863,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,You better not either.
228376,L402859,u6772,m451,VADA,"Just, hurry."
228377,L402858,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Umm, Ummmmm"
228378,L402857,u6772,m451,VADA,Say something it's too quiet.
228379,L402852,u6772,m451,VADA,Okay on the count of three.
228380,L402851,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Okay, okay."
228381,L402850,u6772,m451,VADA,Just do it.
228382,L402849,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,But then I won't be able to see anything.
228383,L402848,u6772,m451,VADA,Close your eyes.
228384,L402847,u6772,m451,VADA,"Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice."
228385,L402846,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Like this?
228386,L402845,u6772,m451,VADA,"Here, practice on your arm like this."
228387,L402844,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"But, I don't know how."
228388,L402843,u6772,m451,VADA,"Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal."
228389,L402842,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,No.
228390,L402841,u6772,m451,VADA,Uh huh.
228391,L402840,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Like they do on TV?
228392,L402839,u6772,m451,VADA,Have you ever kissed anyone?
228393,L402838,u6772,m451,VADA,Not true.
228394,L402837,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair."
228395,L402836,u6772,m451,VADA,It is not.
228396,L402835,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law."
228397,L402834,u6772,m451,VADA,I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
228398,L402833,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Well when you get older, you just have to."
228399,L402822,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?"
228400,L402821,u6772,m451,VADA,I dunno..
228401,L402820,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Hi Vada, can you come out?"
228402,L402819,u6772,m451,VADA,"Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys."
228403,L402798,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Okay, seeya."
228404,L402797,u6772,m451,VADA,"No, I'm hiding out."
228405,L402796,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,You can come to my house for dinner?
228406,L402795,u6772,m451,VADA,"Leave then, some friend you are."
228407,L402794,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"I have to anyway, my mom will be worried."
228408,L402793,u6772,m451,VADA,"Then go home, baby."
228409,L402792,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"I'm hungry, I can't last any longer."
228410,L402791,u6772,m451,VADA,He likes her better than me.
228411,L402790,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"I do, she's real funny."
228412,L402789,u6772,m451,VADA,I don't like her.
228413,L402788,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,So now you'll have a mother.
228414,L402787,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,They're getting married?
228415,L402786,u6772,m451,VADA,"You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring."
228416,L402785,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Wow, was it a decoder ring?"
228417,L402784,u6772,m451,VADA,My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
228418,L402783,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Why are you running away?
228419,L402782,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere."
228420,L402781,u6772,m451,VADA,Get up!?
228421,L402778,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Really?
228422,L402777,u6772,m451,VADA,"No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family."
228423,L402776,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I wanna live with them too.
228424,L402775,u6772,m451,VADA,"California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch."
228425,L402770,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Bye Ma.
228426,L402769,u6772,m451,VADA,Bye Mrs. Sennett.

228440,L402702,u6772,m451,VADA,What do you want it for anyway?
228441,L402701,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"You're right, let's knock it down."
228442,L402700,u6772,m451,VADA,"Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!"
228443,L402699,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Stand back.

228451,L402690,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Hey Vada, guess what we got?"
228452,L402487,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
228453,L402486,u6772,m451,VADA,Go???
228454,L402485,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Can we go yet?
228455,L402476,u6772,m451,VADA,Duck!
228456,L402475,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
228457,L402474,u6772,m451,VADA,"We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch."
228458,L402473,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids."
228459,L402467,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I stopped that!
228460,L402466,u6772,m451,VADA,Bed wetter!
228461,L402465,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I am not.
228462,L402464,u6772,m451,VADA,Pacifist!
228463,L402463,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I told you i'll get in trouble.
228464,L402462,u6772,m451,VADA,"Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight."
228465,L402461,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
228466,L402460,u6772,m451,VADA,Sorry.
228467,L402459,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Don't DO that!!
228468,L402458,u6772,m451,VADA,Here.
228469,L402429,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer."
228470,L402428,u6772,m451,VADA,"It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud."
228471,L402427,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?"
228472,L402426,u6772,m451,VADA,"I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last."
228473,L402425,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Heaven.
228474,L402424,u6772,m451,VADA,What?
228475,L402423,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,What do you think it's like?
228476,L402422,u6772,m451,VADA,No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
228477,L402421,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Do you remember her?
228478,L402420,u6772,m451,VADA,It's my mother.
228479,L402419,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Who's that with your Dad?
228480,L402418,u6772,m451,VADA,Yes.
228481,L402417,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Is that your Dad?
228482,L402416,u6772,m451,VADA,Never mind.
228483,L402415,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Hey, where does it say that?"
228484,L402414,u6772,m451,VADA,You have no personality.
228485,L402413,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,What?
228486,L402412,u6772,m451,VADA,"Hmmmm, interesting."
228487,L402411,u6772,m451,VADA,"Come on, it's fun."
228488,L402410,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"No, I don't wanna."
228489,L402409,u6772,m451,VADA,"That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head."
228490,L402408,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Hey look at this!
228491,L402405,u6772,m451,VADA,"Oh, in the garage. Walk me over."
228492,L402404,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Where's your bike?
228493,L402403,u6772,m451,VADA,A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
228494,L402402,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,What's wrong with your eyes?
228495,L402401,u6772,m451,VADA,No.
228496,L402400,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Your lip bleeding?
228497,L402360,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Okay, OW!"
228498,L402359,u6772,m451,VADA,Uh huh.
228499,L402358,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"If I do it, can we go?"
228500,L402357,u6772,m451,VADA,It'll bleed.
228501,L402356,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,It's a mosquito bite.
228502,L402355,u6772,m451,VADA,You could pick that scab on your arm.
228503,L402354,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Naah, I don't wanna."
228504,L402353,u6772,m451,VADA,"Hey, we can become blood brothers."
228505,L402352,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
228506,L402348,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?"
228507,L402347,u6772,m451,VADA,"Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back."
228508,L402346,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I'm trying.
228509,L402345,u6772,m451,VADA,Hurry!
228510,L402344,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Oh no!  UUH.
228511,L402343,u6772,m451,VADA,"Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!"
228512,L402342,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
228513,L402341,u6772,m451,VADA,Maybe they had a big breakfast.
228514,L402228,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
228515,L402227,u6772,m451,VADA,"It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer."
228516,L402226,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer."
228517,L402223,u6772,m451,VADA,It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
228518,L402222,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"It doesn't work, it always stays black."
228519,L402194,u6772,m451,VADA,Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
228520,L402193,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,Why? It's not dinner time yet.
228521,L402192,u6772,m451,VADA,"No, I'm going home."
228522,L402170,u6772,m451,VADA,Hi Mr. Bixler!
228523,L402169,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!"
228524,L402168,u6772,m451,VADA,"That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him."
228525,L402167,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,At what?
228526,L402149,u6772,m451,VADA,"Oh wow, a real evil canieval."
228527,L402148,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"Hey look at this, no feet!"
228528,L402061,u6771,m451,THOMAS J,"I can't, I have to go home."
228529,L402060,u6772,m451,VADA,I knew he wouldn't come.
228530,L404521,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Part of being a New Yorker.
228531,L404520,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,You don't miss much.
228532,L404513,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
228533,L404512,u6773,m452,DIGGER,I honestly wish I could...
228534,L404511,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Stay, huh?"
228535,L404510,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
228536,L404509,u6773,m452,DIGGER,What?
228537,L404508,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away."
228538,L404507,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
228539,L404506,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Something like that.
228540,L404505,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?"
228541,L404504,u6773,m452,DIGGER,You should look like you dressed yourself.
228542,L404503,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I should look different.
228543,L404502,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear."
228544,L404500,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"Well, then, I'll take it up with her."
228545,L404499,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Yeah, it's in the contract."
228546,L404991,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"Oh, you're more than okay."
228547,L404990,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
228548,L404988,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Good girl.
228549,L404987,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I did what I came to do.
228550,L404739,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Hey, handsome.  Brevity this..."
228551,L404738,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
228552,L404533,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,And what will he do?
228553,L404532,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose."
228554,L404530,u6773,m452,DIGGER,To belong to someone.
228555,L404529,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Needing.
228556,L404528,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
228557,L404527,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I'm moving this book to Viking.
228558,L404526,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it."
228559,L404525,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I'm taking my next book to Viking.
228560,L404524,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
228561,L404523,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"You're going to say it, aren't you?"
228562,L404518,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Manicure...
228563,L404517,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Major.  Dish.
228564,L404516,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Two words.
228565,L404495,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,It's too late to start over.
228566,L404494,u6773,m452,DIGGER,I suppose it's too late to start over.
228567,L404489,u6773,m452,DIGGER,What do you suggest?
228568,L404488,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
228569,L404483,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I can't even say it.
228570,L404482,u6773,m452,DIGGER,I give.
228571,L404481,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!"
228572,L404480,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Elmer's Glue?
228573,L404479,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,That was Thursday.
228574,L404478,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Ben Gay.
228575,L404477,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Try less appropriate.
228576,L404476,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Neosporin?
228577,L404475,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I wish.
228578,L404474,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Zit cream?
228579,L404472,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
228580,L404471,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
228581,L404467,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Let's not get carried away.
228582,L404466,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Someday she'll thank you.
228583,L404465,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!"
228584,L404464,u6773,m452,DIGGER,The man you love.
228585,L404463,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!"
228586,L404462,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Impressive.
228587,L404461,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
228588,L404460,u6773,m452,DIGGER,It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
228589,L404459,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
228590,L404458,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Sure.
228591,L404457,u6773,m452,DIGGER,And you believe that.
228592,L404456,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
228593,L404455,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... and having ""done the right thing"" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times."
228594,L404454,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"You've been working on this, huh?"
228595,L404453,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years..."
228596,L404450,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Because I realized.  When I see him say ""I do,"" that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every..."
228597,L404449,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Go figure you.
228598,L404448,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I was devastated.
228599,L404445,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her."
228600,L404444,u6773,m452,DIGGER,You like her.
228601,L404443,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit."
228602,L404441,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You're butting in.
228603,L404440,u6773,m452,DIGGER,I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
228604,L404439,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You flew all the way h...
228605,L404438,u6773,m452,DIGGER,When I'm talking to children.
228606,L404437,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
228607,L404436,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
228608,L404014,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!"
228609,L404013,u6773,m452,DIGGER,I can see why.
228610,L404012,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
228611,L404010,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"It's called the Law of Love, asshole."
228612,L404009,u6773,m452,DIGGER,You have a real philosophy of life.
228613,L404008,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves."
228614,L404007,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"No, he's ruining yours."
228615,L404006,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
228616,L403966,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
228617,L403965,u6773,m452,DIGGER,I have a suggestion...
228618,L403964,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,We'll never be the same.
228619,L403962,u6773,m452,DIGGER,We're about to find out.
228620,L403961,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,He can't do that to me!
228621,L403960,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
228622,L403959,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th..."
228623,L403958,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Desperate.  To talk.
228624,L403957,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You think...
228625,L403953,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"He says, ""Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"""
228626,L403952,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Blood oath.
228627,L403951,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me..."
228628,L403950,u6773,m452,DIGGER,I've lost interest.
228629,L403944,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
228630,L403943,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring."
228631,L403940,u6773,m452,DIGGER,He's still in love with you.
228632,L403939,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there."
228633,L403938,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight."
228634,L403937,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Kindred spirits.
228635,L403936,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone."
228636,L403927,u6773,m452,DIGGER,The wandering sportswriter.
228637,L403926,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk."
228638,L403922,u6773,m452,DIGGER,... weeks.
228639,L403921,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
228640,L403920,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them."
228641,L403919,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w..."
228642,L403918,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Needs salt.
228643,L403915,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
228644,L403914,u6773,m452,DIGGER,Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
228645,L403913,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out."
228646,L403912,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"I've adjusted, and thanks for asking."
228647,L403911,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?"
228648,L403910,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note."
228649,L403909,u6773,m452,DIGGER,"Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?"
228650,L404938,u6775,m452,KIMMY,That's entirely understandable.
228651,L404937,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I never want to go through this again.
228652,L404930,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Have you ever heard of. Irony?
228653,L404929,u6775,m452,KIMMY,WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
228654,L404928,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
228655,L404786,u6775,m452,KIMMY,I love him.
228656,L404785,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat..."
228657,L404783,u6775,m452,KIMMY,... that this is all my fault?
228658,L404782,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"If you're waiting for ""Do you take this man?"", that's considered poor form."
228659,L404781,u6775,m452,KIMMY,Don't you see...
228660,L404780,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
228661,L404779,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"What with the psychosis and all, yeah."
228662,L404778,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"This must be... very, very, hard on him."
228663,L404777,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
228664,L404773,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?"
228665,L404772,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared..."
228666,L404424,u6775,m452,KIMMY,We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
228667,L404423,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Uh, Kimmy...?"
228668,L404280,u6775,m452,KIMMY,I just don't want to freak him out.
228669,L404279,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
228670,L404271,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"He won't get mad, huh?"
228671,L404270,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful..."
228672,L404269,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Only.  If he wants to.
228673,L404268,u6775,m452,KIMMY,He'll see right through it.
228674,L404261,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
228675,L404260,u6775,m452,KIMMY,Exactly what?
228676,L404259,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Exactly.
228677,L404258,u6775,m452,KIMMY,So... one almost has to...
228678,L404252,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Hello.
228679,L404251,u6775,m452,KIMMY,Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
228680,L404249,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Gold nose hair clippers.
228681,L404248,u6775,m452,KIMMY,For the twins? What in the world is th...
228682,L404244,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,... whatever is manly and independent.
228683,L404243,u6775,m452,KIMMY,But he always says...
228684,L404241,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four..."
228685,L404240,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"I mean, he loves his job."
228686,L404239,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
228687,L404238,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"I just think you're wrong, is all."
228688,L404237,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th..."
228689,L404236,u6775,m452,KIMMY,About Michael's job.
228690,L404184,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes..."
228691,L404183,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"Stop, we're embarrassing h..."
228692,L404182,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff..."
228693,L404181,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the..."
228694,L404115,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!"
228695,L404114,u6775,m452,KIMMY,Ju...
228696,L404113,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Jesus, we're trapped!"
228697,L404112,u6775,m452,KIMMY,He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
228698,L404111,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I've missed a step.
228699,L404110,u6775,m452,KIMMY,You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
228700,L404109,u6775,m452,KIMMY,You win.
228701,L404108,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I was gonna predict that.
228702,L404107,u6775,m452,KIMMY,And the answer was so simple.
228703,L404106,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,No.
228704,L404105,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em."
228705,L404104,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, perfection can get wearing after whi..."
228706,L404103,u6775,m452,KIMMY,You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
228707,L404100,u6775,m452,KIMMY,... except one.
228708,L404099,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
228709,L404098,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage..."
228710,L404097,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Let me rephrase that...
228711,L404096,u6775,m452,KIMMY,So it's sweet of you to be protective...
228712,L404095,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
228713,L404094,u6775,m452,KIMMY,And loving him means loving all of this.
228714,L404091,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life."
228715,L404090,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
228716,L404089,u6775,m452,KIMMY,But he sure can kiss.
228717,L404088,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"A trademark move, don't touch it."
228718,L404087,u6775,m452,KIMMY,He sucks soup through his front teeth.
228719,L404085,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times..."
228720,L404084,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,How about...
228721,L404081,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?"
228722,L404080,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
228723,L404076,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit..."
228724,L404075,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel..."
228725,L404074,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,So your honeymoon is exactly where?
228726,L404073,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye..."
228727,L404071,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
228728,L404070,u6775,m452,KIMMY,What? Because I'm a little understand...
228729,L404069,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s..."
228730,L404059,u6775,m452,KIMMY,... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
228731,L404058,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Don't you have to be somewh...
228732,L404052,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"He said that, too."
228733,L404051,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
228734,L404049,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"... you hate weddings, you never go."
228735,L404048,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,What else did he tell you...
228736,L404047,u6775,m452,KIMMY,Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
228737,L404046,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
228738,L404041,u6775,m452,KIMMY,The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
228739,L404040,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Which was the disqualifying factor?
228740,L404039,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!"
228741,L404038,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
228742,L404037,u6775,m452,KIMMY,You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
228743,L404034,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,... you want a menage on your wedding night.
228744,L404033,u6775,m452,KIMMY,This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
228745,L404032,u6775,m452,KIMMY,See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
228746,L404031,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Can you watch the road?
228747,L404030,u6775,m452,KIMMY,But I can't be dry.
228748,L404029,u6775,m452,KIMMY,I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
228749,L404028,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Excuse me?
228750,L404026,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You need a few dollars.
228751,L404025,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor..."
228752,L404023,u6775,m452,KIMMY,I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
228753,L404022,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, we're..."
228754,L404021,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that..."
228755,L404913,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?"
228756,L404912,u6776,m452,MANDY,"I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding..."
228757,L404911,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Ex-cuse me?
228758,L404909,u6776,m452,MANDY,"Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty."
228759,L404908,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?"
228760,L404907,u6776,m452,MANDY,"Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking."
228761,L404657,u6776,m452,MANDY,"... well, maybe it works on fingers, too."
228762,L404656,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I saw the show.
228763,L404646,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
228764,L404645,u6776,m452,MANDY,... look good on Kimberly.
228765,L404644,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
228766,L404124,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,... unless he has a hump.
228767,L404123,u6776,m452,MANDY,"Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one."
228768,L404587,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
228769,L404586,u6779,m452,WALTER,"Well, you're a little early..."
228770,L404585,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Nobody has.  So far.
228771,L404584,u6779,m452,WALTER,"I haven't caused... a problem, have I?"
228772,L404581,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials."
228773,L404580,u6779,m452,WALTER,I thought Michael was picking me up.
228774,L404355,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I."
228775,L404354,u6779,m452,WALTER,Maybe.  I should call Ben.
228776,L404351,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating."
228777,L404350,u6779,m452,WALTER,And you think he's kept this to himself.
228778,L404347,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job."
228779,L404346,u6779,m452,WALTER,It doesn't say th...
228780,L404345,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I think he's been fired.
228781,L404343,u6779,m452,WALTER,I know Ben.
228782,L404342,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss."
228783,L404340,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?"
228784,L404339,u6779,m452,WALTER,"Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something..."
228785,L404337,u6779,m452,WALTER,I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
228786,L404336,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Is anybody watching?
228787,L404306,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"I think you're making a mistake, sir."
228788,L404305,u6779,m452,WALTER,"They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time."
228789,L404143,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Nice meeting you, too, Walt."
228790,L404142,u6779,m452,WALTER,"Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules."
228791,L404141,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
228792,L404140,u6779,m452,WALTER,"If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show."
228793,L404904,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed."
228794,L404903,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is..."
228795,L404902,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,If you find her...
228796,L404901,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who..."
228797,L404899,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,That's little egotistical.
228798,L404898,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
228799,L404897,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to..."
228800,L404896,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love..."
228801,L404891,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,That is so romantic.
228802,L404890,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Almost three.
228803,L404889,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,It's two weeks.
228804,L404888,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I never forgot that.
228805,L404884,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,This is where I proposed.
228806,L404883,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Why would she come here...
228807,L404882,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I came here, looking for her."
228808,L404881,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before..."
228809,L404869,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
228810,L404868,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Lower.
228811,L404867,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Lower.
228812,L404866,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
228813,L404861,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
228814,L404860,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?"
228815,L404857,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,ARE YOU CRAZY?
228816,L404856,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy."
228817,L404855,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
228818,L404852,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,DON'T SPEAK!
228819,L404851,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Uh.  I saw that moving...
228820,L404826,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think."
228821,L404825,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Jules, what's wrong..."
228822,L404823,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Shhh.
228823,L404822,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,What's up?
228824,L404818,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
228825,L404817,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"The Big Hurt, huh?"
228826,L404815,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz."
228827,L404814,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"... yeah, that."
228828,L404813,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,... your one chance for true happiness?
228829,L404811,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, it happens."
228830,L404810,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable."
228831,L404809,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Oh, yeah."
228832,L404808,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Thank God you were here.
228833,L404799,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
228834,L404798,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Does that make it right...
228835,L404793,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,She admits it's her fault.
228836,L404792,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I asked you...
228837,L404769,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER."
228838,L404768,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Well.  How come she didn't...
228839,L404767,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,And your point?
228840,L404766,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,This is her family and her fault.
228841,L404764,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Get married, apparently."
228842,L404763,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?"
228843,L404762,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!"
228844,L404761,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward..."
228845,L404760,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
228846,L404735,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
228847,L404734,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
228848,L404732,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
228849,L404731,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something..."
228850,L404726,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now."
228851,L404725,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif..."
228852,L404724,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other."
228853,L404723,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Michael...
228854,L404720,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,A bad combination.
228855,L404719,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
228856,L404717,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,It's over.
228857,L404716,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,What happened?
228858,L404700,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"""Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."""
228859,L404699,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
228860,L404698,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"""Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."""
228861,L404697,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
228862,L404694,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
228863,L404693,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Michael? What ha...
228864,L404692,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,... maybe it's congratulations.
228865,L404691,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone..."
228866,L404685,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,It means a lot.
228867,L404684,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,This thing means that much to y...
228868,L404682,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"You're right.  Easy come, easy go."
228869,L404681,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?"
228870,L404678,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there..."
228871,L404677,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou..."
228872,L404676,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves."
228873,L404675,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
228874,L404672,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,That's my point!!
228875,L404671,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow."
228876,L404670,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I'm up against a deadline.
228877,L404665,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
228878,L404664,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s..."
228879,L404617,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Yes.
228880,L404616,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Will she like it?
228881,L404615,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard."
228882,L404614,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,No accents today.
228883,L404608,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Well.
228884,L404607,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Takes me back.
228885,L404577,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,We danced to it.  Just like this.
228886,L404576,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"So we heard it... like, right that... that first..."
228887,L404574,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,The night we met.
228888,L404573,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Where did we first hear th...
228889,L404570,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days."
228890,L404569,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Dance card filled?
228891,L404561,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it."
228892,L404560,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
228893,L404556,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Me either.
228894,L404555,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I can hardly wait for your wedding.
228895,L404554,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Except for that.
228896,L404553,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
228897,L404552,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
228898,L404551,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You've been the man in mine.
228899,L404550,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life."
228900,L404548,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,It's more than that.
228901,L404547,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
228902,L404546,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Have you.
228903,L404545,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually."
228904,L404544,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,If you like.
228905,L404543,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Don't you throw up on boat?
228906,L404542,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,No.  I've got you.
228907,L404541,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"You miss her, huh?"
228908,L404539,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, you've got the rest of your lives."
228909,L404538,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her."
228910,L404537,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You keep saying that.
228911,L404536,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Big weddings are so strange.
228912,L404497,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Like I said, dazzling."
228913,L404496,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out."
228914,L404412,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!"
228915,L404411,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun..."
228916,L404410,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's ""needs,"" and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society."
228917,L404403,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Michael!!
228918,L404402,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
228919,L404385,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Never can tell.
228920,L404384,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?"
228921,L404326,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
228922,L404325,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
228923,L404322,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Boy, those were the days."
228924,L404321,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking."
228925,L404320,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I switched that around when you weren't looking.
228926,L404319,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,You never eat when you're despondent.
228927,L404318,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I never eat when I'm serene.
228928,L404317,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,You're not eating.
228929,L404216,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
228930,L404215,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Still.  All's fair in love and w...
228931,L404214,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I got the point.
228932,L404213,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
228933,L404212,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
228934,L404211,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t..."
228935,L404209,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers..."
228936,L404208,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"What, leaving school..."
228937,L404207,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice."
228938,L404203,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?"
228939,L404202,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Should I whistle down a cab?
228940,L404189,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Till the gas ran out.
228941,L404188,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
228942,L404187,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Firenze.
228943,L404186,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Where was that, Florence, huh?"
228944,L404174,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
228945,L404173,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list..."
228946,L404171,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
228947,L404170,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"She finds him ""personable."""
228948,L404169,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Waiter! Check, please!"
228949,L404168,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
228950,L404167,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh..."
228951,L404166,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!"
228952,L404165,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Quite the little eccentric.
228953,L404164,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Every day.  She makes the bed.
228954,L404163,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,My very point.  Here's another one...
228955,L404162,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Endearingly absent-minded.
228956,L404161,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down."
228957,L404160,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,What's next?
228958,L404159,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
228959,L404158,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Hate that.
228960,L404157,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,She's too genuine.
228961,L404156,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,Such as.
228962,L404155,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability."
228963,L404154,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability."
228964,L404153,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year..."
228965,L404148,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
228966,L404147,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you."
228967,L404068,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Mirrors.
228968,L404067,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,What's the sec...
228969,L404001,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I can't wait for you to meet her!
228970,L404000,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,W...
228971,L403999,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Please come, please."
228972,L403997,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I need you.
228973,L403996,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, maybe we should talk ab..."
228974,L403994,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"... Thomas, yeh."
228975,L403993,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank..."
228976,L403992,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such."
228977,L403991,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su..."
228978,L403989,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,You've met her parents.
228979,L403988,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people..."
228980,L403987,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, sure."
228981,L403985,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you."
228982,L403984,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, somet..."
228983,L403983,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,And she's all wrong for me!
228984,L403982,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
228985,L403981,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee..."
228986,L403974,u6774,m452,JULIANNE,"Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally..."
228987,L403973,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,I've been calling for days!
228988,L404419,u6775,m452,KIMMY,MICHAEL!!
228989,L404418,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m..."
228990,L404416,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says ""Mikey-poo""? Or do I have to change my name to ""Binky""?"
228991,L404415,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"Well, if that's the way you f..."
228992,L404414,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!"
228993,L404409,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient."
228994,L404408,u6775,m452,KIMMY,What is that sup...
228995,L404407,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!"
228996,L404406,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!"
228997,L404405,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life..."
228998,L404398,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,... and you knew about this.
228999,L404397,u6775,m452,KIMMY,And to m...
229000,L404396,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,To him.
229001,L404395,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him..."
229002,L404394,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"Like family, huh?"
229003,L404393,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust..."
229004,L404392,u6775,m452,KIMMY,... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
229005,L404391,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
229006,L404380,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"No, it's, uh... a real big favor."
229007,L404379,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"It's not just a gag, huh?"
229008,L404201,u6775,m452,KIMMY,To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
229009,L404200,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,Because I could come...
229010,L404198,u6775,m452,KIMMY,The most important thing. Is being together.
229011,L404197,u6777,m452,MICHAEL,"I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps..."
229012,L404196,u6775,m452,KIMMY,"Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now..."
229013,L404662,u6778,m452,SAMMY,You're much more his type.
229014,L404661,u6776,m452,MANDY,"Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl."
229015,L404650,u6776,m452,MANDY,An so it is.
229016,L404649,u6778,m452,SAMMY,He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
229017,L404648,u6776,m452,MANDY,Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
229018,L404647,u6778,m452,SAMMY,Maybe it's happy there.
229019,L404637,u6776,m452,MANDY,"With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret."
229020,L404636,u6778,m452,SAMMY,And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
229021,L404635,u6778,m452,SAMMY,"This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted..."
229022,L404634,u6776,m452,MANDY,... I'm partial to the tight end.
229023,L404633,u6778,m452,SAMMY,"Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter..."
229024,L404632,u6778,m452,SAMMY,"Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches..."
229025,L404605,u6778,m452,SAMMY,"... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen."
229026,L404604,u6776,m452,MANDY,"Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor..."
229027,L407531,u6798,m453,STAR,Come on.
229028,L407530,u6780,m453,ALBUQUERQUE,I won first prize.
229029,L407529,u6798,m453,STAR,"Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I."
229030,L407528,u6780,m453,ALBUQUERQUE,Hi! Star.
229031,L407527,u6798,m453,STAR,Winifred.

229089,L407114,u6785,m453,GREEN,"Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that."

229096,L407505,u6782,m453,BARNETT,"No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?"
229097,L407504,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position."
229098,L407503,u6782,m453,BARNETT,"I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules."
229099,L407500,u6782,m453,BARNETT,I said 'no!'
229100,L407499,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,They can come to the concert in the park.
229101,L407498,u6782,m453,BARNETT,What?
229102,L407485,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
229103,L407484,u6782,m453,BARNETT,His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
229104,L407483,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,His Word.
229105,L407482,u6782,m453,BARNETT,Whose word?
229106,L407481,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
229107,L407480,u6782,m453,BARNETT,How is that?
229108,L407479,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Well, it's probably because it would help him."
229109,L407478,u6782,m453,BARNETT,He knows better.
229110,L407477,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
229111,L407476,u6782,m453,BARNETT,"Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen."
229112,L407475,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven."
229113,L407338,u6782,m453,BARNETT,"Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks."

229122,L406898,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Oh, sure."
229123,L406897,u6782,m453,BARNETT,"I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home."
229124,L406896,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all."
229125,L406895,u6782,m453,BARNETT,She's going to rest now.
229126,L406894,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South."

229131,L407361,u6782,m453,BARNETT,I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
229132,L407360,u6797,m453,REESE,"It's on National television, Barnett."
229133,L407359,u6782,m453,BARNETT,You know better than that.

229228,L407021,u6795,m453,NURSE,"That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy."
229229,L407020,u6785,m453,GREEN,Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
229230,L407019,u6795,m453,NURSE,HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
229231,L407561,u6785,m453,GREEN,"Good night,"
229232,L407560,u6787,m453,KENNY,Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
229233,L407559,u6785,m453,GREEN,"Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are."
229234,L407010,u6785,m453,GREEN,A little. What do you need?
229235,L407009,u6787,m453,KENNY,"Listen, do you know anything about cars?"
229236,L407008,u6787,m453,KENNY,Suits me.
229237,L407007,u6785,m453,GREEN,"Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like."
229238,L407006,u6787,m453,KENNY,I'm not really a musician.
229239,L407005,u6785,m453,GREEN,"When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you."
229240,L407004,u6787,m453,KENNY,Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
229241,L407003,u6785,m453,GREEN,"My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?"
229242,L407002,u6787,m453,KENNY,She sure sings nice.
229243,L407001,u6785,m453,GREEN,I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
229244,L406997,u6785,m453,GREEN,I think we can do that. Come in.
229245,L406996,u6787,m453,KENNY,"Yes, sir. I need a room"
229246,L406995,u6785,m453,GREEN,Can I help you?
229247,L406994,u6787,m453,KENNY,"Yes, sir."
229248,L406775,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,That Tom sure is cute.
229249,L406774,u6785,m453,GREEN,Maybe you can look after me a little.
229250,L406773,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
229251,L406772,u6785,m453,GREEN,"I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers."
229252,L406771,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,"I said, maybe I'll change my name again."
229253,L406770,u6785,m453,GREEN,What did you say?
229254,L406769,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,"Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant."
229255,L406768,u6785,m453,GREEN,"Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul."
229256,L406767,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
229257,L406766,u6785,m453,GREEN,It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
229258,L406765,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,You know anything about the stations here?
229259,L406764,u6785,m453,GREEN,She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
229260,L406763,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,Uh huh.
229261,L406734,u6785,m453,GREEN,I'1l get your bag.
229262,L406733,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,He is just wonderful.
229263,L406732,u6785,m453,GREEN,"Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too."
229264,L406731,u6788,m453,L.A. JOAN,Did you see who that was?
229265,L407315,u6786,m453,JOAN,I don't really know what you're talking about.
229266,L407314,u6787,m453,KENNY,"I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and..."
229267,L407313,u6786,m453,JOAN,"I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland."
229268,L407312,u6787,m453,KENNY,"Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no..."
229269,L407288,u6786,m453,JOAN,I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
229270,L407287,u6787,m453,KENNY,"Well, he's really amazing."
229271,L407286,u6786,m453,JOAN,You must really like him.
229272,L407285,u6787,m453,KENNY,Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
229273,L407284,u6786,m453,JOAN,How do you know?

229275,L407282,u6786,m453,JOAN,Who's that?
229276,L407281,u6787,m453,KENNY,Replacement party.
229277,L407280,u6786,m453,JOAN,What's this?

229338,L406853,u6789,m453,LINNEA,Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
229339,L406852,u6796,m453,OPAL,And before?
229340,L406851,u6789,m453,LINNEA,About three years.

229342,L406849,u6789,m453,LINNEA,It just is.

229347,L406844,u6796,m453,OPAL,When did you start singing?
229348,L406843,u6789,m453,LINNEA,"Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here."

229356,L407550,u6800,m453,TOM,Older than thirty?

229418,L407435,u6802,m453,WADE,All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
229419,L407434,u6802,m453,WADE,High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
229420,L407433,u6789,m453,LINNEA,What?
229421,L407432,u6802,m453,WADE,I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
229422,L407431,u6789,m453,LINNEA,I'm not sure...
229423,L407430,u6802,m453,WADE,Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
229424,L407429,u6789,m453,LINNEA,Oh.
229425,L407428,u6802,m453,WADE,Premeditated murder.
229426,L407427,u6789,m453,LINNEA,Oh.
229427,L407426,u6802,m453,WADE,I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
229428,L407137,u6789,m453,LINNEA,I'll be there.
229429,L407136,u6803,m453,WOMAN'S VOICE,Eight-thirty in the chapel.
229430,L407135,u6789,m453,LINNEA,What time?
229431,L407134,u6803,m453,WOMAN'S VOICE,Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
229432,L407133,u6789,m453,LINNEA,It's me. What is it?
229433,L407132,u6803,m453,WOMAN'S VOICE,You sound different. Is that really you?
229434,L407131,u6789,m453,LINNEA,Yes.
229435,L407130,u6803,m453,WOMAN'S VOICE,Linnea?
229436,L407129,u6789,m453,LINNEA,Hello.
229437,L406937,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
229438,L406936,u6791,m453,MANAGER,"That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break."
229439,L406935,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
229440,L406934,u6791,m453,MANAGER,"Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around."
229441,L406933,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,Hundreds of times.
229442,L406932,u6791,m453,MANAGER,Are you sure you know what you're doing?
229443,L406930,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,Money's no object.
229444,L406929,u6791,m453,MANAGER,I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
229445,L406923,u6791,m453,MANAGER,How much?
229446,L406922,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,I can do benefits
229447,L407195,u6792,m453,MARY,What!
229448,L407194,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,You don't know how pleased he'll be.
229449,L407192,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Might be good for you.
229450,L407191,u6792,m453,MARY,An album.
229451,L407190,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"You're doing some recording here, aren't you?"
229452,L407189,u6792,m453,MARY,What National TV...?
229453,L407180,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,You're real favorites of his.
229454,L407179,u6792,m453,MARY,What for?
229455,L407169,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Yes.
229456,L407168,u6792,m453,MARY,For him?
229457,L407167,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
229458,L407160,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,He's pretty well known down here.
229459,L407159,u6792,m453,MARY,"Oh, no."
229460,L407152,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Glad to meet you.
229461,L407151,u6792,m453,MARY,Hello.
229462,L407150,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Hello. John Triplette.
229463,L407034,u6792,m453,MARY,Out.
229464,L407033,u6794,m453,NORMAN,Where are you going?
229465,L407032,u6792,m453,MARY,Sleeping.
229466,L407031,u6794,m453,NORMAN,Where's Bill?
229467,L407030,u6792,m453,MARY,You're not.
229468,L407029,u6794,m453,NORMAN,Sorry I'm late.
229469,L407206,u6800,m453,TOM,Mary?
229470,L407205,u6794,m453,NORMAN,I mean...
229471,L407204,u6800,m453,TOM,Oh?
229472,L407203,u6794,m453,NORMAN,You know Bill is really mad at you.
229473,L407202,u6794,m453,NORMAN,They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
229474,L407201,u6800,m453,TOM,"Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want..."
229475,L407200,u6794,m453,NORMAN,Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
229476,L407199,u6800,m453,TOM,How's your stomach?
229477,L406978,u6800,m453,TOM,Just a minute.
229478,L406977,u6796,m453,OPAL,Come on.
229479,L406976,u6800,m453,TOM,"Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?"
229480,L406975,u6796,m453,OPAL,Come on back to bed.
229481,L406918,u6800,m453,TOM,Depends on what I'm studying.
229482,L406917,u6796,m453,OPAL,Do you study at all?
229483,L406916,u6800,m453,TOM,Probably a little too long.
229484,L406915,u6796,m453,OPAL,How long have you been together?
229485,L406914,u6800,m453,TOM,Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
229486,L406913,u6796,m453,OPAL,Did it break?
229487,L406912,u6800,m453,TOM,"No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box."
229488,L406911,u6796,m453,OPAL,Do they have a show to give it to you?
229489,L406910,u6800,m453,TOM,We just got a gold record.
229490,L407068,u6796,m453,OPAL,What? Oh. A film.
229491,L407067,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,What?
229492,L407066,u6796,m453,OPAL,Why?
229493,L407065,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Why?
229494,L407064,u6796,m453,OPAL,"The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks."
229495,L407063,u6796,m453,OPAL,I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
229496,L407062,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Oh yes, I'm John Triplette."
229497,L407061,u6796,m453,OPAL,I'm Opal.
229498,L407060,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Hello.
229499,L407059,u6796,m453,OPAL,Hi.
229500,L406841,u6797,m453,REESE,I'll be dammed.
229501,L406840,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
229502,L406839,u6797,m453,REESE,"I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?"
229503,L406838,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff."
229504,L406837,u6797,m453,REESE,You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
229505,L406836,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Ryan O'Neal.
229506,L406835,u6797,m453,REESE,I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
229507,L406834,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Peter Finch -- he's English.
229508,L406833,u6797,m453,REESE,Who?
229509,L406832,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Ah... Peter Finch.
229510,L406831,u6797,m453,REESE,No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
229511,L406830,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,I know a couple.
229512,L406829,u6797,m453,REESE,"Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?"
229513,L406828,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Spent time in Arizona. Why?
229514,L406827,u6797,m453,REESE,You always live there?
229515,L406826,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Southern California.
229516,L406825,u6797,m453,REESE,Where are you from?
229517,L406824,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority."
229518,L406823,u6797,m453,REESE,"He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago."
229519,L406822,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,He is to a lot of people.
229520,L406821,u6797,m453,REESE,He ain't really new.
229521,L406820,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
229522,L406819,u6797,m453,REESE,You do?
229523,L406818,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Well, I really think he's got a chance."
229524,L406817,u6797,m453,REESE,"We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?"
229525,L406816,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Oh --
229526,L406815,u6797,m453,REESE,"No, we never did that"
229527,L406814,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,You go to school together?
229528,L406813,u6797,m453,REESE,"Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time."
229529,L406812,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,What do you think of him?
229530,L406741,u6797,m453,REESE,Where is she?
229531,L406740,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,Pleasure
229532,L406798,u6802,m453,WADE,Sure thing.
229533,L406797,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,You think it will?
229534,L406796,u6802,m453,WADE,"Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then."
229535,L406795,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
229536,L406794,u6802,m453,WADE,You serious?
229537,L406793,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
229538,L406792,u6802,m453,WADE,You think I should take lessons?
229539,L406791,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,It's not bad.
229540,L406790,u6802,m453,WADE,Is that good?
229541,L406789,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,You sure do it loud.
229542,L406788,u6802,m453,WADE,You think I got any kind of a voice?
229543,L406787,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,"No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing."
229544,L406712,u6802,m453,WADE,"Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?"
229545,L406711,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,Got me an audition tonight.
229546,L406710,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,You bet.
229547,L406709,u6802,m453,WADE,You want a ride into town?
229548,L407415,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room."
229549,L407414,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
229550,L407412,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
229551,L407411,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,I see.
229552,L407410,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,"Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise."
229553,L407403,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,May I see your costume?
229554,L407402,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,"Oh, why thank you."
229555,L407401,u6801,m453,TRIPLETTE,I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
229556,L407400,u6799,m453,SUELEEN,"Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay."
229557,L407959,u6804,m454,GRACE,What...
229558,L407958,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing..."
229559,L407940,u6804,m454,GRACE,"Yes, you are."
229560,L407939,u6808,m454,MICKEY,That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
229561,L407938,u6804,m454,GRACE,"Yes, they were."
229562,L407937,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?"
229563,L407936,u6804,m454,GRACE,"Yes, I would."
229564,L407935,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?"
229565,L407934,u6804,m454,GRACE,That's what Tim said.
229566,L407933,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts."
229567,L407932,u6804,m454,GRACE,"Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style."
229568,L407931,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?"
229569,L407930,u6804,m454,GRACE,"Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do."
229570,L407929,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?"
229571,L407928,u6804,m454,GRACE,The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
229572,L407927,u6808,m454,MICKEY,What was the color of Tim's belt?
229573,L407926,u6804,m454,GRACE,Yes you are.
229574,L407925,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?"
229575,L407920,u6808,m454,MICKEY,More or less...
229576,L407919,u6804,m454,GRACE,More or less.
229577,L407579,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk."
229578,L407578,u6805,m454,MABEL,"When ya had it, did ya like it?"
229579,L407577,u6808,m454,MICKEY,I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
229580,L407576,u6805,m454,MABEL,"The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste."
229581,L407575,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Which do you recommend?
229582,L407574,u6805,m454,MABEL,"Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime."
229583,L407573,u6808,m454,MICKEY,What kind of pies do you have?
229584,L408394,u6806,m454,MALLORY,"Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon."
229585,L408393,u6817,m454,WAYNE,How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
229586,L408392,u6806,m454,MALLORY,"Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that."
229587,L408387,u6806,m454,MALLORY,We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
229588,L408386,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Try to keep it to a minimum.
229589,L408385,u6806,m454,MALLORY,"Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?"
229590,L408384,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
229591,L408383,u6806,m454,MALLORY,I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
229592,L408382,u6817,m454,WAYNE,What did you think then?
229593,L408381,u6806,m454,MALLORY,"It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work."
229594,L408380,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?"
229595,L408402,u6808,m454,MICKEY,I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
229596,L408401,u6806,m454,MALLORY,Looked like an interview to me.
229597,L408389,u6806,m454,MALLORY,"What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky."
229598,L408388,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Divine intervention.
229599,L408348,u6808,m454,MICKEY,We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
229600,L408347,u6806,m454,MALLORY,Hasn't it?
229601,L408326,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Don't stop!
229602,L408325,u6806,m454,MALLORY,Mickey!
229603,L408319,u6806,m454,MALLORY,"Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut."
229604,L408318,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"By all means, knock yourself out."
229605,L408317,u6806,m454,MALLORY,Yeah.
229606,L408316,u6808,m454,MICKEY,You got something you want to do?
229607,L408315,u6806,m454,MALLORY,Are we in a big hurry?
229608,L408314,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?"
229609,L407916,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it."
229610,L407915,u6806,m454,MALLORY,"Naw, she don't mind."
229611,L407985,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that."
229612,L407984,u6817,m454,WAYNE,I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
229613,L407983,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,Using the same doctors is not common practice.
229614,L407982,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
229615,L407981,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
229616,L407980,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Who is we?
229617,L407979,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong."
229618,L407978,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?"
229619,L407977,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates."
229620,L407976,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
229621,L407975,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need."
229622,L407974,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
229623,L407640,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Ain't love grand.
229624,L407639,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
229625,L407636,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
229626,L407635,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Who's the song bird?
229627,L407632,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?"
229628,L407631,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,I see.
229629,L407630,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests."
229630,L407628,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback..."
229631,L407627,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,By all means.
229632,L407626,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?"
229633,L407625,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,"So, how do I fit into this scheme?"
229634,L407624,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,You've heard of it?
229635,L407623,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Lobotomy Bay?
229636,L407622,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
229637,L407621,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,I can appreciate that.
229638,L407620,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out."
229639,L407619,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines."
229640,L407618,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
229641,L407617,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"Susanville, Soledade."
229642,L407616,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
229643,L407615,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,You been followin' the news coverage?
229644,L407614,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Who isn't?
229645,L407611,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
229646,L407610,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,"Thank you, sir."
229647,L407609,u6807,m454,MCCLUSKY,"Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank."
229648,L408282,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Okay, Wayne, step forward."
229649,L408281,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Yeah.
229650,L408276,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!"
229651,L408275,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,"She's in the holding cell, on this floor."
229652,L408274,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene."
229653,L408232,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,What?
229654,L408231,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
229655,L408223,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
229656,L408222,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
229657,L408221,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,"Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor."
229658,L408220,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
229659,L408171,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,How's it goin'?
229660,L408170,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?"
229661,L408289,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Wagons, hooaaa!"
229662,L408288,u6813,m454,ROGER,Ready.
229663,L408287,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"You ready, Donut?"
229664,L408244,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!"
229665,L408243,u6813,m454,ROGER,It's video.
229666,L408242,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Do you have a back up.
229667,L408241,u6813,m454,ROGER,Not good.
229668,L408240,u6808,m454,MICKEY,How is it?
229669,L408234,u6813,m454,ROGER,"Yes, sir."
229670,L408233,u6808,m454,MICKEY,You guys stay on your bellies.
229671,L408117,u6813,m454,ROGER,"Look, I'll trade you."
229672,L408116,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Tough titty, it's mine now."
229673,L408115,u6813,m454,ROGER,"Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special."
229674,L408114,u6808,m454,MICKEY,There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
229675,L408113,u6813,m454,ROGER,"Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box."
229676,L408110,u6813,m454,ROGER,Anything.
229677,L408109,u6808,m454,MICKEY,What?
229678,L408108,u6813,m454,ROGER,Say something.
229679,L408098,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Oh my God!  Sorry.
229680,L408097,u6813,m454,ROGER,She was born without a tongue.
229681,L408096,u6808,m454,MICKEY,How come you never talk?
229682,L408411,u6817,m454,WAYNE,NO!!!
229683,L408410,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Let's make a little music, Colorada."
229684,L408409,u6808,m454,MICKEY,We are.  Your camera.
229685,L408408,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
229686,L408407,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you."
229687,L408406,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---"
229688,L408405,u6808,m454,MICKEY,No. Not really.
229689,L408404,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?"
229690,L408400,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?"
229691,L408399,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Just wait one fucking minute.
229692,L408391,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"So, what now?"
229693,L408390,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up."
229694,L408379,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory..."
229695,L408378,u6808,m454,MICKEY,We ain't got all fuckin' day!
229696,L408364,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Got it.
229697,L408363,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off."
229698,L408362,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Yes.
229699,L408361,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?"
229700,L408360,u6808,m454,MICKEY,'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
229701,L408359,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award..."
229702,L408358,u6808,m454,MICKEY,'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
229703,L408357,u6817,m454,WAYNE,On average forty million.
229704,L408356,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?"
229705,L408312,u6817,m454,WAYNE,We'll all be killed.
229706,L408311,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try."
229707,L408310,u6817,m454,WAYNE,This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
229708,L408309,u6808,m454,MICKEY,No.
229709,L408308,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Mickey, can I talk to you alone?"
229710,L408307,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Let me have the keys.
229711,L408306,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Out front.
229712,L408305,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Where's it parked?
229713,L408304,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Yeah, we have a van."
229714,L408303,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van."
229715,L408239,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told."
229716,L408238,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
229717,L408237,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke."
229718,L408213,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date."
229719,L408212,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Sure.
229720,L408211,u6808,m454,MICKEY,You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
229721,L408183,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
229722,L408182,u6808,m454,MICKEY,I could go for a Coke.
229723,L408178,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Okay, let's cut it."
229724,L408177,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer."
229725,L408168,u6808,m454,MICKEY,When have they ever been right?
229726,L408167,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Says the United States of America.
229727,L408166,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Says who?
229728,L408165,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?"
229729,L408164,u6808,m454,MICKEY,That's indescribable.
229730,L408163,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?"
229731,L408162,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers..."
229732,L408161,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Describe Mallory.
229733,L408160,u6808,m454,MICKEY,I'm sure we will.
229734,L408159,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
229735,L408158,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job."
229736,L408157,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Tell me about the purity.
229737,L408156,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?"
229738,L408155,u6817,m454,WAYNE,You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
229739,L408148,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?"
229740,L408147,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song."
229741,L408146,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?"
229742,L408145,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was."
229743,L408144,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?"
229744,L408143,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
229745,L408142,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
229746,L408141,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Was what worth it?
229747,L408140,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Then was it worth it?
229748,L408139,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question."
229749,L408138,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Do you miss Mallory?
229750,L408137,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else."
229751,L408136,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters."
229752,L408135,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
229753,L408132,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Aside from the obvious?
229754,L408131,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun."
229755,L408123,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Let's do it.
229756,L408122,u6817,m454,WAYNE,We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
229757,L408121,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Don't worry about it.
229758,L408120,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Sorry about that.
229759,L408078,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
229760,L408077,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"All right, Mickey."
229761,L408076,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about."
229762,L407890,u6808,m454,MICKEY,I'm keen with anticipation.
229763,L407889,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?"
229764,L407691,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case."
229765,L407690,u6808,m454,MICKEY,She sings? What does she sing?
229766,L407689,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Not to anybody. She sings.
229767,L407688,u6808,m454,MICKEY,She doesn't talk?
229768,L407687,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word."
229769,L407686,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Have you talked to Mallory about this?
229770,L407685,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?"
229771,L407684,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?"
229772,L407683,u6808,m454,MICKEY,"Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king."
229773,L407682,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Manson beat you.
229774,L407681,u6808,m454,MICKEY,How 'bout Manson?
229775,L407680,u6817,m454,WAYNE,What I'd like to do---
229776,L407679,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Good...yuppie piece of shit.
229777,L407678,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
229778,L407677,u6808,m454,MICKEY,How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
229779,L407676,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Yours.
229780,L407675,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Whose ratings were higher?
229781,L407674,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Yes.
229782,L407673,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
229783,L407672,u6817,m454,WAYNE,The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
229784,L407669,u6808,m454,MICKEY,Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
229785,L407668,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---"
229786,L407862,u6809,m454,MOVIE MALLORY,You made every day like kindergarten.
229787,L407861,u6810,m454,MOVIE MICKEY,Yeah baby.
229788,L407854,u6810,m454,MOVIE MICKEY,"I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!"
229789,L407853,u6809,m454,MOVIE MALLORY,"Mickey, you're wasting time!"
229790,L407852,u6810,m454,MOVIE MICKEY,No fuckin' way!
229791,L407851,u6809,m454,MOVIE MALLORY,"If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---"
229792,L407850,u6810,m454,MOVIE MICKEY,No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
229793,L407849,u6809,m454,MOVIE MALLORY,"I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here."
229794,L407848,u6810,m454,MOVIE MICKEY,"I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--"
229795,L407847,u6809,m454,MOVIE MALLORY,I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
229796,L407809,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"Unfortunately, yes."
229797,L407808,u6817,m454,WAYNE,And they made the first move?
229798,L407807,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move."
229799,L407806,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
229800,L407805,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move."
229801,L407804,u6817,m454,WAYNE,How can you say that you 'admire' them?
229802,L407791,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Yes.
229803,L407790,u6811,m454,NORMAN,Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
229804,L407789,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Yes.
229805,L407829,u6816,m454,SIMON,They actually apologized.
229806,L407828,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off."
229807,L407827,u6816,m454,SIMON,They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
229808,L407826,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"Apparently, they've seen all our films."
229809,L407825,u6816,m454,SIMON,"Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'"
229810,L407824,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'"
229811,L407823,u6816,m454,SIMON,"Just for fun, I guess."
229812,L407822,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us."
229813,L407820,u6816,m454,SIMON,Survival of the fittest.
229814,L407819,u6811,m454,NORMAN,They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
229815,L407818,u6816,m454,SIMON,That's the way of the world.
229816,L407817,u6811,m454,NORMAN,That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
229817,L407803,u6811,m454,NORMAN,Yes.
229818,L407802,u6816,m454,SIMON,Yes.
229819,L407800,u6816,m454,SIMON,Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
229820,L407799,u6811,m454,NORMAN,They've hypnotized the nation.
229821,L407798,u6816,m454,SIMON,Only on a much grander scale.
229822,L407797,u6811,m454,NORMAN,Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
229823,L407796,u6816,m454,SIMON,He had the edge. The mind's edge.
229824,L407795,u6811,m454,NORMAN,He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
229825,L407794,u6816,m454,SIMON,"---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had."
229826,L407793,u6811,m454,NORMAN,And a snake-eye glare.
229827,L407792,u6816,m454,SIMON,Through the power of the simple word---
229828,L407788,u6816,m454,SIMON,Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
229829,L407787,u6811,m454,NORMAN,Hypnotizing.
229830,L407784,u6811,m454,NORMAN,"I do, too."
229831,L407783,u6816,m454,SIMON,I admire them.
229832,L408269,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Jesus...
229833,L408268,u6812,m454,PITNEY,That's my opinion.
229834,L408267,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,The entire wing?
229835,L408266,u6812,m454,PITNEY,I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
229836,L408265,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Take a wild stab!
229837,L408264,u6812,m454,PITNEY,It's hard to say Capt'n.
229838,L408263,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?"
229839,L408249,u6812,m454,PITNEY,Here.
229840,L408248,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Where do the air ducts lead?
229841,L408247,u6812,m454,PITNEY,Here's the layout of the laundry room.
229842,L408246,u6812,m454,PITNEY,Capt'n!
229843,L408245,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway."
229844,L408128,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Scotty?
229845,L408127,u6813,m454,ROGER,Rockin'!
229846,L408126,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Roger?
229847,L408119,u6813,m454,ROGER,"Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer."
229848,L408118,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra."
229849,L408017,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear."
229850,L408016,u6813,m454,ROGER,Wayne---
229851,L408015,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front."
229852,L408014,u6813,m454,ROGER,"So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?"
229853,L408013,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year."
229854,L408012,u6813,m454,ROGER,"What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---"
229855,L408011,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Roger, no."
229856,L408010,u6813,m454,ROGER,That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
229857,L408009,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
229858,L408008,u6813,m454,ROGER,"I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box."
229859,L408007,u6817,m454,WAYNE,You can't be serious?
229860,L407730,u6817,m454,WAYNE,I hear ya. Play.
229861,L407729,u6813,m454,ROGER,Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
229862,L407712,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Next week's episode.
229863,L407711,u6813,m454,ROGER,How immediate is immediately?
229864,L407706,u6813,m454,ROGER,This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
229865,L407705,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews..."
229866,L408207,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me."
229867,L408206,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,"Yeah, sure."
229868,L408205,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Jack, could you stay up here for a while?"
229869,L408197,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Me, neither. I don't eat meat."
229870,L408196,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
229871,L408195,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
229872,L408194,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,How 'bout Mallory?
229873,L408193,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Waitin' in the lounge.
229874,L408192,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
229875,L408191,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,"Yeah, we met. They're good men."
229876,L408190,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
229877,L408189,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
229878,L408188,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Are you all set?
229879,L408175,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Two-thirty. Shhh...
229880,L408174,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
229881,L408173,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,What the hell happened to you?
229882,L407665,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Wayne Gayle!
229883,L407664,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Wayne Gayle.
229884,L407663,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Who?
229885,L407662,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor."
229886,L407661,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,And where do you keep Mickey?
229887,L407660,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey."
229888,L407659,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,What's the travelling arrangements?
229889,L407656,u6814,m454,SCAGNETTI,Thanks.
229890,L407655,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox."
229891,L408181,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
229892,L408180,u6815,m454,SCOTT,It's gonna be beautiful.
229893,L408151,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!"
229894,L408150,u6815,m454,SCOTT,Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
229895,L408130,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Slate it.
229896,L408129,u6815,m454,SCOTT,Rollin'...and speed!
229897,L408001,u6815,m454,SCOTT,Perfecto!
229898,L408000,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"How's it working, Scotty?"
229899,L407992,u6815,m454,SCOTT,Okay.
229900,L407991,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing."
229901,L407724,u6815,m454,SCOTT,"Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first..."
229902,L407723,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Okay, boys, let's have it."
229903,L407721,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Tomorrow.
229904,L407720,u6815,m454,SCOTT,When do you want the assembly?
229905,L407719,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in."
229906,L407710,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately."
229907,L407709,u6815,m454,SCOTT,Would the network really not run it without the interview?
229908,L407708,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes."
229909,L407816,u6816,m454,SIMON,"Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again."
229910,L407815,u6817,m454,WAYNE,But you'll never be whole again.
229911,L407814,u6816,m454,SIMON,By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
229912,L407813,u6817,m454,WAYNE,How so?
229913,L407812,u6816,m454,SIMON,They passed the 'edge' along to us.
229914,L407811,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Why?
229915,L407810,u6816,m454,SIMON,"But you see, that's okay, Wayne."
229916,L407786,u6816,m454,SIMON,They're mesmerising.
229917,L407785,u6817,m454,WAYNE,But how can you say that?
229918,L408209,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there."
229919,L408208,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Could we go with you and film it?
229920,L408185,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?"
229921,L408184,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
229922,L408105,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here."
229923,L408104,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Don't call my men assholes.
229924,L408103,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes."
229925,L408102,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
229926,L408101,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
229927,L408100,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,And me.
229928,L408099,u6817,m454,WAYNE,So we got a deal. Four deputies---
229929,L408065,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it."
229930,L408064,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Three.
229931,L408063,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,I can't do that. Five guys.
229932,L408062,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys."
229933,L408061,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Okay. I'll take two guys off.
229934,L408060,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Two guys?
229935,L408059,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,What are we talking about?
229936,L408058,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it."
229937,L408057,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Wayne, if it was anybody else---"
229938,L408056,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys."
229939,L408055,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this."
229940,L408054,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig."
229941,L408053,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
229942,L408052,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---"
229943,L408051,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career."
229944,L408050,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?"
229945,L408049,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Lose 'em.
229946,L408048,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?"
229947,L408046,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy."
229948,L408045,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,It sure is.
229949,L408044,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?"
229950,L408043,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more."
229951,L408042,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---"
229952,L408041,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
229953,L408040,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Really?
229954,L408039,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Ya know, I was."
229955,L408038,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---"
229956,L408037,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,I see.
229957,L408036,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand."
229958,L408035,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,Is that her real name?
229959,L408034,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie."
229960,L408033,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Oh yes, indeed. Top flight."
229961,L408032,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?"
229962,L408031,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,By all means.
229963,L408030,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you."
229964,L408029,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?"
229965,L408022,u6817,m454,WAYNE,"That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me."
229966,L408021,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
229967,L408020,u6817,m454,WAYNE,Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
229968,L408019,u6818,m454,WURLITZER,"Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you."
229969,L409806,u6819,m455,BARTENDER,They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
229970,L409805,u6822,m455,DUFF,They done that too long in my family.
229971,L409804,u6819,m455,BARTENDER,"Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton."
229972,L409803,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah.
229973,L409802,u6819,m455,BARTENDER,"Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola."
229974,L409801,u6822,m455,DUFF,How 'bout that furniture plant?
229975,L409249,u6820,m455,DORIS,"Come on, honey."
229976,L409248,u6822,m455,DUFF,No thanks.
229977,L409247,u6820,m455,DORIS,Want me to come?
229978,L409246,u6822,m455,DUFF,Out.
229979,L409245,u6820,m455,DORIS,Where' you goin'?
229980,L409239,u6820,m455,DORIS,"Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie."
229981,L409238,u6822,m455,DUFF,Give her a beer.
229982,L409242,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,"Hell, you got steady work."
229983,L409241,u6820,m455,DORIS,"You think so, Frankie?"
229984,L409240,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,"You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife."
229985,L409237,u6820,m455,DORIS,"What d'you say, Duff?"
229986,L409236,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,See Duff. He's the money man.
229987,L409235,u6820,m455,DORIS,"You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?"
229988,L409234,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,"Everybody givin' it away free, huh?"
229989,L409233,u6820,m455,DORIS,It sure is.
229990,L409232,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,"What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?"
229991,L409231,u6820,m455,DORIS,Who's going to buy me a beer?
229992,L409921,u6822,m455,DUFF,That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
229993,L409920,u6821,m455,DRIVER,"Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!"
229994,L409919,u6822,m455,DUFF,"All right, you get out of here, man!"
229995,L409918,u6821,m455,DRIVER,"I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!"
229996,L409914,u6821,m455,DRIVER,"You in a big hurry, boy?"
229997,L409913,u6822,m455,DUFF,That'll be thirty-eight cents.
229998,L409907,u6821,m455,DRIVER,"Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?"
229999,L409906,u6822,m455,DUFF,That'll be thirty-eight cents.
230000,L409905,u6821,m455,DRIVER,Boy - you hear me?!
230001,L409903,u6821,m455,DRIVER,"No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine."
230002,L409902,u6822,m455,DUFF,Fill her up?
230003,L409761,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,"Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?"
230004,L409760,u6822,m455,DUFF,What d'you think?
230005,L409759,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,"Want to keep your job, boy?"
230006,L409758,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,"All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all."
230007,L409757,u6822,m455,DUFF,No. You got the wrong idea.
230008,L409756,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,"Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble."
230009,L409755,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, what d'you know?!"
230010,L409754,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,"Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?"
230011,L409753,u6822,m455,DUFF,Used to be. On the railroad.
230012,L409752,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,You a union man?
230013,L409751,u6822,m455,DUFF,I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
230014,L409750,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,"That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys."
230015,L409749,u6822,m455,DUFF,I don't know what you're talkin' about.
230016,L409748,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
230017,L409747,u6822,m455,DUFF,Okay.
230018,L409746,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,Want to talk to you.
230019,L409745,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's right.
230020,L409744,u6834,m455,SUPERVISOR,'You Duff Anderson?
230021,L409786,u6822,m455,DUFF,Anderson.
230022,L409785,u6836,m455,WHITE,What did you say your name is?
230023,L409784,u6822,m455,DUFF,Walker and Williams.
230024,L409783,u6836,m455,WHITE,Where was that?
230025,L409782,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah.
230026,L409665,u6836,m455,WHITE,"You' new here, man!  See you, boys."
230027,L409664,u6822,m455,DUFF,I know.
230028,L409659,u6836,m455,WHITE,"So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!"
230029,L409658,u6822,m455,DUFF,I'll smile when it's funny.
230030,L409657,u6836,m455,WHITE,"What's the matter, boy? Never smile?"
230031,L409362,u6836,m455,WHITE,"Don't start no trouble, boy!"
230032,L409361,u6822,m455,DUFF,I said: Cut it out!
230033,L409501,u6823,m455,EFFIE,I don't know.
230034,L409500,u6822,m455,DUFF,Where's he at?

230036,L409498,u6822,m455,DUFF,'That right? I thought he was up North.
230037,L409497,u6823,m455,EFFIE,They say your dad's 'round town.
230038,L409496,u6822,m455,DUFF,Make sure he gets those shots.
230039,L409495,u6823,m455,EFFIE,Okay.
230040,L409494,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on."
230041,L409486,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different."
230042,L409485,u6823,m455,EFFIE,I don't know. He's your boy.
230043,L409484,u6822,m455,DUFF,Like where?
230044,L409483,u6823,m455,EFFIE,"Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick."

230046,L409481,u6823,m455,EFFIE,"She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither."
230047,L409480,u6822,m455,DUFF,Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
230048,L409479,u6823,m455,EFFIE,She done moved to Detroit.
230049,L409478,u6822,m455,DUFF,Where's Wilma?
230050,L409477,u6823,m455,EFFIE,"James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy."
230051,L409476,u6823,m455,EFFIE,'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
230052,L409475,u6822,m455,DUFF,Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.

230082,L409797,u6827,m455,JOE,It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
230083,L409796,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah, I been there."
230084,L409795,u6827,m455,JOE,Been over to the other mill?
230085,L409794,u6827,m455,JOE,"You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different."

230090,L409671,u6827,m455,JOE,Like hell they wouldn't.
230091,L409670,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it."
230092,L409667,u6822,m455,DUFF,That ain't my idea of friendliness.
230093,L409666,u6827,m455,JOE,"You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly."
230094,L409623,u6822,m455,DUFF,"That's right. How' you doin', Barney?"
230095,L409622,u6827,m455,JOE,"Hard to get up in the morning, huh?"
230096,L409951,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Like I said, baby - I'll write you."
230097,L409950,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Duff--
230098,L409949,u6822,m455,DUFF,Okay.
230099,L409948,u6822,m455,DUFF,"You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit."
230100,L409947,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"You're not a man because of a job, Duff."
230101,L409946,u6822,m455,DUFF,"You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways."
230102,L409945,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I don't think that'll happen.
230103,L409944,u6822,m455,DUFF,"When I get set, I'll send for you."
230104,L409943,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Where're you going to go?
230105,L409942,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, that'll be the first time."
230106,L409941,u6829,m455,JOSIE,There's nothing to say.
230107,L409940,u6822,m455,DUFF,Ain't you goin' to say something?
230108,L409937,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, that don't do me one bit of good!"
230109,L409936,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Duff, I love you."
230110,L409935,u6822,m455,DUFF,Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
230111,L409934,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What d'you mean?
230112,L409933,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how."
230113,L409873,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth."
230114,L409872,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Not if you see them for what they are, Duff."
230115,L409871,u6822,m455,DUFF,Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
230116,L409870,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
230117,L409869,u6822,m455,DUFF,You were plenty scared that night in the car.
230118,L409868,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
230119,L409867,u6822,m455,DUFF,How come you don't hate their guts?
230120,L409846,u6822,m455,DUFF,Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
230121,L409845,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
230122,L409844,u6822,m455,DUFF,You heard me!
230123,L409841,u6822,m455,DUFF,Watch out!
230124,L409840,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Don't do that!
230125,L409839,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What're you going to do?
230126,L409838,u6822,m455,DUFF,No point fixin' it!
230127,L409837,u6822,m455,DUFF,'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
230128,L409836,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Day work.
230129,L409835,u6822,m455,DUFF,What the hell could you do?
230130,L409834,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway."
230131,L409833,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah!
230132,L409832,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"I'm trying to help, Duff."
230133,L409831,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?"
230134,L409830,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
230135,L409825,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You can have what I've got. It's right there.
230136,L409824,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car."
230137,L409823,u6829,m455,JOSIE,About ten dollars.
230138,L409822,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?"
230139,L409821,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Hi.
230140,L409779,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out."
230141,L409778,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"We can always do that, Duff."
230142,L409777,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here."
230143,L409776,u6829,m455,JOSIE,They won't.
230144,L409775,u6822,m455,DUFF,Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
230145,L409774,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You will.
230146,L409773,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
230147,L409771,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?"
230148,L409770,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Don't deny me, Duff."
230149,L409765,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah.
230150,L409764,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Don't, Duff."
230151,L409740,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, he ain't mine, so skip it."
230152,L409739,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I keep thinking about him.
230153,L409738,u6822,m455,DUFF,How come you keep askin'?
230154,L409737,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What about your boy?
230155,L409736,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here."
230156,L409735,u6829,m455,JOSIE,We'll be all right.
230157,L409734,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby."
230158,L409733,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Well, I haven't come around."
230159,L409732,u6822,m455,DUFF,You jivin' me?
230160,L409731,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Don't look so scared.
230161,L409730,u6822,m455,DUFF,Huh?
230162,L409729,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"How would you like to have a baby, Duff?"
230163,L409702,u6829,m455,JOSIE,My father's never done a thing for any of them.
230164,L409701,u6822,m455,DUFF,"It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life."
230165,L409698,u6822,m455,DUFF,Go on - hit me!
230166,L409697,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I don't want to hurt you.
230167,L409696,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!"
230168,L409695,u6822,m455,DUFF,Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
230169,L409694,u6829,m455,JOSIE,My kids want me to teach them.
230170,L409693,u6822,m455,DUFF,Uh-huh. Why?
230171,L409692,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You know how to box?
230172,L409691,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, if you don't know I can't tell you."
230173,L409690,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You still didn't answer my question.
230174,L409689,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me."
230175,L409688,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You didn't answer my question.
230176,L409687,u6822,m455,DUFF,Hmmm - good coffee.
230177,L409686,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Am I as good as they?
230178,L409685,u6822,m455,DUFF,What about them?
230179,L409684,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Duff - you know those women you used to know--
230180,L409683,u6822,m455,DUFF,Everything you cook is good.
230181,L409682,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Come here, baby."
230182,L409681,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
230183,L409680,u6822,m455,DUFF,Smells like something crawled in there and died.
230184,L409679,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What's wrong?
230185,L409678,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Yeah, that's so."
230186,L409677,u6822,m455,DUFF,Is that so?
230187,L409618,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?"
230188,L409617,u6829,m455,JOSIE,He could live with us.
230189,L409616,u6822,m455,DUFF,What about him?
230190,L409613,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
230191,L409612,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Don't call them that.
230192,L409611,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?"
230193,L409610,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah?
230194,L409609,u6829,m455,JOSIE,That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
230195,L409604,u6829,m455,JOSIE,It'll be fine when we get done with it.
230196,L409603,u6822,m455,DUFF,"It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?"
230197,L409602,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Well, what d'you think?"
230198,L409601,u6822,m455,DUFF,I can see why.
230199,L409579,u6829,m455,JOSIE,No. But a small one.
230200,L409578,u6822,m455,DUFF,"She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?"
230201,L409577,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What about that girl?
230202,L409576,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
230203,L409575,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Don't push me, Duff."
230204,L409574,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?"
230205,L409573,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"What happened, Duff?"
230206,L409572,u6822,m455,DUFF,How about it?
230207,L409571,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Thank you.
230208,L409570,u6822,m455,DUFF,Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
230209,L409569,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What d'you mean?
230210,L409568,u6822,m455,DUFF,"You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?"
230211,L409567,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"I'll have some coffee, please."
230212,L409566,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Okay, I guess."
230213,L409565,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Your boy.
230214,L409564,u6822,m455,DUFF,What?
230215,L409563,u6829,m455,JOSIE,How did it go?
230216,L409562,u6822,m455,DUFF,I thought you wasn't comin'.
230217,L409561,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Hi.
230218,L409470,u6822,m455,DUFF,I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
230219,L409469,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What's he like?
230220,L409468,u6822,m455,DUFF,Four.
230221,L409467,u6829,m455,JOSIE,How old is your boy?
230222,L409465,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence."
230223,L409464,u6822,m455,DUFF,I'll see you later.
230224,L409463,u6829,m455,JOSIE,That's right.
230225,L409462,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah, it's just a coincidence."
230226,L409461,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I'm just going in to do my shopping.
230227,L409460,u6822,m455,DUFF,No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
230228,L409459,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Surprised?
230229,L409456,u6822,m455,DUFF,"No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye."
230230,L409455,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Are you married?
230231,L409454,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah. Well, I do."
230232,L409453,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I didn't know you had one.
230233,L409452,u6822,m455,DUFF,Goin' to see my kid.
230234,L409451,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Just for the day?
230235,L409450,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham."
230236,L409449,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow."
230237,L409448,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'."
230238,L409447,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What d'you mean?
230239,L409446,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah. It's just like I figured.
230240,L409445,u6829,m455,JOSIE,That's the way he is.
230241,L409444,u6822,m455,DUFF,Ain't your fault.
230242,L409405,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now."
230243,L409404,u6829,m455,JOSIE,No.
230244,L409403,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
230245,L409402,u6829,m455,JOSIE,'Been up north?
230246,L409401,u6822,m455,DUFF,I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
230247,L409400,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Why did you?
230248,L409399,u6822,m455,DUFF,"At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back."
230249,L409391,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Good night, Duff."
230250,L409390,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hell, baby, I don't know what to say."
230251,L409389,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other."
230252,L409388,u6822,m455,DUFF,"All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?"
230253,L409387,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?"
230254,L409386,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married."
230255,L409385,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What?
230256,L409384,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Oh yeah, and then what?"
230257,L409383,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"No, on the porch."
230258,L409382,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?"
230259,L409381,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I wouldn't have let you.
230260,L409380,u6822,m455,DUFF,You almost got into trouble back there.
230261,L409379,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What d'you mean?
230262,L409378,u6822,m455,DUFF,"You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein."
230263,L409377,u6829,m455,JOSIE,But I would like to see you again.
230264,L409376,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now."
230265,L409375,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Not here, Duff."
230266,L409373,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Scared, huh?"
230267,L409372,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything."
230268,L409371,u6822,m455,DUFF,"You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town."
230269,L409370,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway."
230270,L409369,u6822,m455,DUFF,"That's why you come back, huh?"
230271,L409368,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids."
230272,L409367,u6822,m455,DUFF,How come you stay 'round here?
230273,L409365,u6822,m455,DUFF,Take it easy.
230274,L409364,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Let's go, Duff."
230275,L409357,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Don't Duff--
230276,L409356,u6822,m455,DUFF,Get out of here!
230277,L409352,u6822,m455,DUFF,You got a problem all right.
230278,L409351,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times."
230279,L409348,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I see. That beer made me dizzy.
230280,L409347,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, I don't get on so well most places."
230281,L409346,u6829,m455,JOSIE,How d'you mean?
230282,L409345,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
230283,L409344,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?"
230284,L409343,u6822,m455,DUFF,Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
230285,L409342,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
230286,L409338,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails."
230287,L409337,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Well, they seem just like everyone else."
230288,L409336,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's right.
230289,L409335,u6829,m455,JOSIE,They must work on the section gang.
230290,L409326,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What is it?
230291,L409325,u6822,m455,DUFF,Hell!
230292,L409324,u6822,m455,DUFF,Go on - you can have one!
230293,L409323,u6829,m455,JOSIE,No thanks.
230294,L409322,u6822,m455,DUFF,How about another beer?
230295,L409321,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I like a place with lots of life.
230296,L409320,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too."
230297,L409319,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You keep asking me why I'm here.
230298,L409318,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, that's a funny thing to say."
230299,L409317,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"You don't think much of yourself, do you?"
230300,L409316,u6822,m455,DUFF,So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
230301,L409315,u6829,m455,JOSIE,No.
230302,L409314,u6822,m455,DUFF,Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
230303,L409313,u6829,m455,JOSIE,How d'you mean?
230304,L409312,u6822,m455,DUFF,"You know, baby, I can't figure you out."
230305,L409311,u6829,m455,JOSIE,What d'you expect?
230306,L409310,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
230307,L409280,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Maybe.
230308,L409279,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?"
230309,L409278,u6829,m455,JOSIE,That's right.
230310,L409277,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice."
230311,L409276,u6829,m455,JOSIE,My father's the preacher.
230312,L409275,u6822,m455,DUFF,No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
230313,L409274,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Yes, aren't you?"
230314,L409273,u6822,m455,DUFF,No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
230315,L409272,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Your folks live there?
230316,L409271,u6822,m455,DUFF,Oh yeah? That's my home town.
230317,L409270,u6829,m455,JOSIE,In Birmingham.
230318,L409269,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Went to college, huh?"
230319,L409268,u6829,m455,JOSIE,I'm a teacher.
230320,L409267,u6822,m455,DUFF,You work around town?
230321,L409266,u6829,m455,JOSIE,Oh yeah?
230322,L409265,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah. On the section gang.
230323,L409264,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You working?
230324,L409263,u6822,m455,DUFF,No. I'm new in town.
230325,L409262,u6829,m455,JOSIE,"Haven't seen you around, have I?"
230326,L409261,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I'll have me some of that punch there, too."
230327,L409260,u6829,m455,JOSIE,You must be new in town.
230328,L409259,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine."
230329,L409722,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,"'Got a good thing, man."
230330,L409721,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Good-bye, Frankie."
230331,L409596,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,"Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky."
230332,L409595,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's right.
230333,L409590,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie."
230334,L409589,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,What 'you signifyin'?
230335,L409588,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum."
230336,L409587,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
230337,L409586,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Like a home, for one thing."
230338,L409585,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,Like what?
230339,L409584,u6822,m455,DUFF,"A whole lot, Frankie."
230340,L409332,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,"Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework."
230341,L409331,u6822,m455,DUFF,"We was just leavin', fellows."
230342,L409298,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,I bet she's easy jam.
230343,L409297,u6822,m455,DUFF,How 'bout the key?
230344,L409296,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,Just get her drunk.
230345,L409253,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Take it easy, Frankie."
230346,L409252,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,What's so hot 'round town?
230347,L409251,u6822,m455,DUFF,'Round town.
230348,L409250,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,Where' you goin'?
230349,L409228,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Why don't you relax, Frankie?"
230350,L409227,u6825,m455,FRANKIE,What you gettin' all pretty for?
230351,L409726,u6822,m455,DUFF,"'Bye, Jocko."
230352,L409725,u6826,m455,JOCKO,'See ya.
230353,L409713,u6826,m455,JOCKO,Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
230354,L409712,u6822,m455,DUFF,"What's eatin' you, Jocko?"
230355,L409711,u6826,m455,JOCKO,I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
230356,L409710,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them."
230357,L409709,u6826,m455,JOCKO,They all got families to support.
230358,L409334,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah, see you in hell."
230359,L409333,u6826,m455,JOCKO,"See you, Duff."
230360,L409977,u6837,m455,WILL,Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
230361,L409976,u6822,m455,DUFF,Better get him to a hospital.
230362,L409975,u6837,m455,WILL,Couldn't get the words out before.
230363,L409961,u6837,m455,WILL,"What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records."
230364,L409960,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Take it easy, Pop."
230365,L409959,u6837,m455,WILL,Beat it!
230366,L409958,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's right.
230367,L409957,u6837,m455,WILL,My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
230368,L409555,u6837,m455,WILL,What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
230369,L409554,u6822,m455,DUFF,Great.
230370,L409553,u6837,m455,WILL,"Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?"
230371,L409552,u6822,m455,DUFF,I heard you.
230372,L409551,u6837,m455,WILL,"I asked you somethin', boy!"
230373,L409535,u6837,m455,WILL,"Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you."
230374,L409534,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round."
230375,L409533,u6837,m455,WILL,'Don't sound so sure.
230376,L409532,u6822,m455,DUFF,No.
230377,L409531,u6837,m455,WILL,Plannin' on getting married?
230378,L409530,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I said, I come to town with a girl."
230379,L409517,u6837,m455,WILL,Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
230380,L409516,u6822,m455,DUFF,What happened?
230381,L409515,u6822,m455,DUFF,Okay.
230382,L409514,u6837,m455,WILL,How about a drink?
230383,L409513,u6822,m455,DUFF,Yeah. That's right.
230384,L409512,u6837,m455,WILL,"Wanted a look at your old man, huh?"
230385,L409511,u6822,m455,DUFF,Nothing. Heard you were in town.
230386,L409510,u6837,m455,WILL,What's on your mind?
230387,L409509,u6822,m455,DUFF,Wouldn't have known you.
230388,L409508,u6837,m455,WILL,Wouldn't have known you.
230389,L409507,u6822,m455,DUFF,I'm Duff.
230390,L409506,u6837,m455,WILL,Who're you?
230391,L409505,u6822,m455,DUFF,'You Will Anderson?
230392,L409899,u6831,m455,OWNER,"I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!"
230393,L409898,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I said, she's in great shape."
230394,L409897,u6831,m455,OWNER,"What did you say, boy?!"
230395,L409896,u6822,m455,DUFF,Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
230396,L409895,u6831,m455,OWNER,Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
230397,L409894,u6822,m455,DUFF,She don't look no worse to me.
230398,L409893,u6831,m455,OWNER,That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
230399,L409892,u6822,m455,DUFF,Sorry.
230400,L409891,u6831,m455,OWNER,"Jesus, I told you to watch it!"
230401,L409889,u6822,m455,DUFF,She'll do.
230402,L409888,u6831,m455,OWNER,Seems a little loose!
230403,L409887,u6822,m455,DUFF,Okay.
230404,L409886,u6831,m455,OWNER,"Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?"
230405,L409885,u6831,m455,OWNER,Just tryin' to be helpful.
230406,L409884,u6822,m455,DUFF,"No, thanks."
230407,L409883,u6831,m455,OWNER,Want me to hold the light for you?
230408,L409882,u6822,m455,DUFF,Okay.
230409,L409881,u6831,m455,OWNER,"How you doin', boy?"
230410,L410021,u6830,m455,LEE,"Good-bye, Duff."
230411,L410020,u6822,m455,DUFF,Who is?!
230412,L410019,u6830,m455,LEE,I know he wasn't much of a father.
230413,L410018,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Hell, I'm just like him."
230414,L410017,u6830,m455,LEE,Don't be too hard on him.
230415,L410016,u6822,m455,DUFF,Okay.
230416,L410015,u6830,m455,LEE,"No, thanks. I'll take the bus."
230417,L410014,u6822,m455,DUFF,"I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home."
230418,L410013,u6830,m455,LEE,How 'you gonna live?
230419,L410012,u6822,m455,DUFF,"No, they won't."
230420,L410011,u6830,m455,LEE,They'll run you out.
230421,L410010,u6822,m455,DUFF,That's right.
230422,L410009,u6830,m455,LEE,"Going back, huh?"
230423,L410008,u6822,m455,DUFF,I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
230424,L410007,u6830,m455,LEE,"Well, what're you going to do?"
230425,L410006,u6822,m455,DUFF,Sure.
230426,L410005,u6830,m455,LEE,It's just that I hate empty rooms.
230427,L410004,u6822,m455,DUFF,"No thanks, Lee."
230428,L410003,u6830,m455,LEE,Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
230429,L409963,u6830,m455,LEE,Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
230430,L409962,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Come on, Pop."
230431,L409560,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Yeah, sure. Good luck."
230432,L409559,u6830,m455,LEE,"Come back some other time, will you?"
230433,L409548,u6830,m455,LEE,"He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around."
230434,L409547,u6822,m455,DUFF,How often is that?
230435,L409546,u6830,m455,LEE,Whenever he's got an edge on.
230436,L409545,u6822,m455,DUFF,How often does he get like that?
230437,L409865,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,I'll be seeing you.
230438,L409864,u6822,m455,DUFF,Oh yeah?
230439,L409863,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
230440,L409860,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!"
230441,L409859,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out."
230442,L409858,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law."
230443,L409857,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,It's for your own good.
230444,L409856,u6822,m455,DUFF,So I been told.
230445,L409853,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"Don't you get smart with me, boy."
230446,L409852,u6822,m455,DUFF,I guess I'll rob a bank.
230447,L409851,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?"
230448,L409850,u6822,m455,DUFF,It ain't in me.
230449,L409849,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want."
230450,L409848,u6822,m455,DUFF,Don't look like there's a right way.
230451,L409847,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way."
230452,L409441,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!"
230453,L409440,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter."
230454,L409439,u6822,m455,DUFF,I guess not.
230455,L409438,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other."
230456,L409437,u6822,m455,DUFF,I doubt it.
230457,L409436,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune."
230458,L409435,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad."
230459,L409434,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
230460,L409433,u6822,m455,DUFF,I guess I ain't.
230461,L409432,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?"
230462,L409431,u6822,m455,DUFF,"Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice."
230463,L409430,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now."
230464,L409429,u6822,m455,DUFF,How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
230465,L409428,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school."

230468,L409425,u6822,m455,DUFF,Guess it's never been easy.
230469,L409424,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
230470,L409414,u6833,m455,REVEREND DAWSON,"All right, son."

230512,L409540,u6837,m455,WILL,"Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?"
230513,L409539,u6837,m455,WILL,"Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it."

230529,L410049,u6838,m456,DANNY,Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
230530,L410048,u6840,m456,OMAR,"I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck."
230531,L410040,u6840,m456,OMAR,No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
230532,L410039,u6838,m456,DANNY,"Omar, listen to me--"
230533,L410038,u6840,m456,OMAR,I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--

230542,L410068,u6839,m456,NATHAN,Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
230543,L410067,u6838,m456,DANNY,We got any shots?
230544,L410064,u6839,m456,NATHAN,Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
230545,L410063,u6838,m456,DANNY,"I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate."
230546,L410062,u6839,m456,NATHAN,So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
230547,L410061,u6838,m456,DANNY,I'm still on my honeymoon.
230548,L410060,u6839,m456,NATHAN,How long's it been?
230549,L410059,u6839,m456,NATHAN,"Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny."
230550,L410058,u6838,m456,DANNY,Since when?
230551,L410057,u6839,m456,NATHAN,Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
230552,L410054,u6839,m456,NATHAN,Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
230553,L410053,u6838,m456,DANNY,"That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time."
230554,L410052,u6839,m456,NATHAN,Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
230555,L410762,u6841,m457,3JANE,Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
230556,L410761,u6851,m457,MOLLY,My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
230557,L410760,u6841,m457,3JANE,You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
230558,L410758,u6851,m457,MOLLY,Don't play with me.
230559,L410757,u6841,m457,3JANE,"He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it."
230560,L410756,u6851,m457,MOLLY,Take this off.
230561,L410754,u6841,m457,3JANE,"Then we would have talked, you and I."
230562,L410753,u6851,m457,MOLLY,No. I only needed the code from you.
230563,L410752,u6841,m457,3JANE,Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
230564,L410621,u6841,m457,3JANE,Of course.
230565,L410620,u6851,m457,MOLLY,They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
230566,L410619,u6841,m457,3JANE,I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
230567,L410618,u6851,m457,MOLLY,Let me get you another glass of wine.
230568,L410616,u6841,m457,3JANE,I'm fine.
230569,L410615,u6851,m457,MOLLY,"Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?"
230570,L410796,u6853,m457,RIVIERA,Of course...
230571,L410795,u6841,m457,3JANE,What about her?
230572,L410794,u6853,m457,RIVIERA,It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
230573,L410793,u6841,m457,3JANE,You're hurt...
230574,L410742,u6853,m457,RIVIERA,Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
230575,L410741,u6841,m457,3JANE,Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
230576,L410733,u6853,m457,RIVIERA,She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
230577,L410732,u6841,m457,3JANE,"She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?"
230578,L410782,u6845,m457,CASE,No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
230579,L410781,u6842,m457,AEROL,Ghost a steppin' razor...
230580,L410747,u6845,m457,CASE,A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
230581,L410746,u6842,m457,AEROL,"What you lookin' for, mon?"
230582,L410728,u6842,m457,AEROL,Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
230583,L410727,u6845,m457,CASE,What the hell is that?
230584,L410717,u6842,m457,AEROL,Straylight. Kitchen dock.

230586,L410672,u6845,m457,CASE,"If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not."

230588,L410670,u6845,m457,CASE,Can you get us into Straylight?

230591,L410543,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode."
230592,L410542,u6851,m457,MOLLY,How's the villa's security?
230593,L410541,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace."

230595,L410533,u6851,m457,MOLLY,We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
230596,L410476,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke."
230597,L410475,u6851,m457,MOLLY,"A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?"
230598,L410234,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
230599,L410233,u6851,m457,MOLLY,What's an A.I.
230600,L410229,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin."

230605,L410517,u6853,m457,RIVIERA,"You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy."

230617,L410596,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,What are you talking about?
230618,L410595,u6845,m457,CASE,"As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage."
230619,L410594,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
230620,L410593,u6845,m457,CASE,Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
230621,L410538,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
230622,L410537,u6845,m457,CASE,"That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long."
230623,L410474,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.

230629,L410468,u6845,m457,CASE,Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
230630,L410356,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.

230652,L410248,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates."

230654,L410246,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.

230656,L410244,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?"
230657,L410243,u6845,m457,CASE,That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.

230659,L410241,u6845,m457,CASE,Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.

230666,L410232,u6845,m457,CASE,Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
230667,L410231,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.

230673,L410223,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain."

230675,L410221,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
230676,L410177,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.

230678,L410175,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
230679,L410174,u6845,m457,CASE,It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
230680,L410173,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me."
230681,L410172,u6845,m457,CASE,Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
230682,L410171,u6845,m457,CASE,I'd say you were full of shit.
230683,L410170,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?

230686,L410167,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
230687,L410166,u6845,m457,CASE,Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
230688,L410165,u6843,m457,ARMITAGE,"Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with."

230692,L410159,u6845,m457,CASE,You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.

230694,L410712,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,"It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case."
230695,L410711,u6845,m457,CASE,Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
230696,L410710,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,"Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment."
230697,L410709,u6845,m457,CASE,"What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?"
230698,L410708,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,"Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself.

230699,L410707,u6845,m457,CASE,The access code to your mainframe.
230700,L410706,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,The words?

230702,L410703,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,"My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard."

230704,L410701,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,"You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote ""Wintermute""."
230705,L410698,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,"I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential."
230706,L410697,u6845,m457,CASE,Can you read my mind?
230707,L410696,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
230708,L410695,u6845,m457,CASE,I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
230709,L410694,u6844,m457,BAO/WINTERMUTE,"An odd selection, Mr Case."

230980,L410734,u6851,m457,MOLLY,Peter... What do you think you're doing?
230981,L411822,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
230982,L411821,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it."
230983,L411437,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh. I forgot.
230984,L411436,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried."
230985,L411435,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What?
230986,L411378,u6854,m458,ALDYS,I'm late for lab.
230987,L411377,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Right. 7:30.
230988,L411376,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets."
230989,L411374,u6854,m458,ALDYS,No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
230990,L411373,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"uhh, must have forgotten-"
230991,L411372,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Hey, where's your sweatshirt?"
230992,L411285,u6854,m458,ALDYS,Exactly.
230993,L411284,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?"
230994,L411283,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Yes, it's lame."
230995,L411282,u6860,m458,JOSIE,It is?
230996,L411281,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame."
230997,L411280,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
230998,L411270,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?"
230999,L411269,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Yeah, I know."
231000,L411268,u6854,m458,ALDYS,Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
231001,L411267,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"That's the old drive-in. They call it ""The Court"". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group."
231002,L411266,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What's that?
231003,L411249,u6854,m458,ALDYS,This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
231004,L411248,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once."
231005,L411247,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge."
231006,L411246,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What is with this school and prom?
231007,L411213,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection"", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other."
231008,L411212,u6860,m458,JOSIE,College?
231009,L411211,u6854,m458,ALDYS,How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
231010,L411210,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Petty good.
231011,L411209,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?"
231012,L411208,u6854,m458,ALDYS,Sure. No problem.
231013,L411207,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Thanks.
231014,L411206,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974."
231015,L411194,u6854,m458,ALDYS,Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
231016,L411193,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?"
231017,L411191,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
231018,L411190,u6854,m458,ALDYS,I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
231019,L411189,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh I know.
231020,L411188,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know."
231021,L411187,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Yeah. Let's do that.
231022,L411186,u6854,m458,ALDYS,": Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?"
231023,L411185,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Why do they listen to Guy?
231024,L411184,u6854,m458,ALDYS,Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
231025,L411183,u6860,m458,JOSIE,How long will they watch us for?
231026,L411182,u6854,m458,ALDYS,Nice.
231027,L411181,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in "" head of cattle"", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like ""I could eat a horse."""
231028,L411180,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Well, do you?"
231029,L411179,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What?
231030,L411176,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-"
231031,L411175,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
231032,L411174,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
231033,L411173,u6854,m458,ALDYS,When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
231034,L411172,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
231035,L411171,u6854,m458,ALDYS,"Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys."
231036,L411370,u6855,m458,ANITA,Nope.
231037,L411369,u6858,m458,GUS,No Roger from op/ed?
231038,L411368,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?"
231039,L411367,u6858,m458,GUS,Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
231040,L411366,u6855,m458,ANITA,"You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you."
231041,L411365,u6858,m458,GUS,"Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand."
231042,L411364,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation."
231043,L411363,u6858,m458,GUS,Leave.
231044,L411362,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Gus, have you ever been in love?"
231045,L411040,u6855,m458,ANITA,YOU KNIT?
231046,L411039,u6858,m458,GUS,YOU DID.
231047,L410934,u6858,m458,GUS,Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
231048,L410933,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Oh, man! Who told?"
231049,L411549,u6865,m458,SAM,"What about the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""The 80's""?"
231050,L411548,u6855,m458,ANITA,Well excuse me.
231051,L411547,u6855,m458,ANITA,"OH! How about ""Under the Sea?"""
231052,L411546,u6865,m458,SAM,Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
231053,L411525,u6855,m458,ANITA,Right. Right.
231054,L411524,u6865,m458,SAM,I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
231055,L411523,u6855,m458,ANITA,I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
231056,L411518,u6855,m458,ANITA,If you say so.
231057,L411517,u6865,m458,SAM,You're Pam?
231058,L411516,u6855,m458,ANITA,Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
231059,L411515,u6865,m458,SAM,Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
231060,L411820,u6855,m458,ANITA,It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
231061,L411819,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Wow. It's packed.
231062,L411783,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own."
231063,L411782,u6855,m458,ANITA,You need my help?
231064,L411781,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do."
231065,L411780,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?"
231066,L411522,u6860,m458,JOSIE,
231067,L411521,u6855,m458,ANITA,Hi!
231068,L411084,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!"
231069,L411083,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Anita!
231070,L411082,u6855,m458,ANITA,And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
231071,L411081,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing."
231072,L411080,u6855,m458,ANITA,Cuuuute!
231073,L411079,u6855,m458,ANITA,"I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady."
231074,L411078,u6860,m458,JOSIE,How about this?
231075,L411077,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Very romantic.
231076,L411076,u6855,m458,ANITA,Bridgework?
231077,L411075,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What'd you feel when you kissed him?
231078,L411074,u6855,m458,ANITA,"So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one."
231079,L411073,u6860,m458,JOSIE,That is lingerie.
231080,L411072,u6855,m458,ANITA,Now this is cute.
231081,L411071,u6855,m458,ANITA,Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
231082,L411070,u6860,m458,JOSIE,At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
231083,L411069,u6855,m458,ANITA,Okay. That's bad.
231084,L411068,u6860,m458,JOSIE,The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
231085,L411067,u6855,m458,ANITA,Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
231086,L411066,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Anita, remember espadrilles?"
231087,L411065,u6855,m458,ANITA,"So, you were a geek. Big deal."
231088,L411038,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?"
231089,L411037,u6855,m458,ANITA,Senorita Josie.
231090,L411036,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?"
231091,L411035,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Jos, that's not what we're --"
231092,L411034,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this."
231093,L411030,u6855,m458,ANITA,"No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!"
231094,L411029,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You don't think I can do it.
231095,L411028,u6855,m458,ANITA,Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
231096,L411027,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"My own undercover feature - ""Written by Josie Geller""."
231097,L410975,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
231098,L410974,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear."
231099,L410973,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"When I finally get kissed, I'll know."
231100,L410972,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion."
231101,L410971,u6860,m458,JOSIE,The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
231102,L410970,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye."
231103,L410969,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Anita!
231104,L410968,u6855,m458,ANITA,Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
231105,L410967,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I'm concentrating on my career right now.
231106,L410966,u6855,m458,ANITA,"I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?"
231107,L410965,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Forget it.
231108,L410957,u6855,m458,ANITA,You stood for like a month.
231109,L410956,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Yeah.
231110,L410955,u6855,m458,ANITA,Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
231111,L410936,u6855,m458,ANITA,"And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?"
231112,L410935,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
231113,L410927,u6855,m458,ANITA,"Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure."
231114,L410926,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, ""I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."""
231115,L410925,u6855,m458,ANITA,Who told!
231116,L410924,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Roger in Op/Ed.
231117,L410923,u6855,m458,ANITA,Guess who I did it with last night...
231118,L411338,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
231119,L411337,u6856,m458,GEORGE,"We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--""Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"""
231120,L411336,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Wings?
231121,L411335,u6856,m458,GEORGE,Hidden camera.
231122,L411334,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What is this?
231123,L411333,u6856,m458,GEORGE,"Just get in the van, Josie."
231124,L411332,u6860,m458,JOSIE,George! What are you doing here?
231125,L411705,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
231126,L411704,u6857,m458,GIBBY,You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
231127,L411672,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
231128,L411671,u6857,m458,GIBBY,Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
231129,L411566,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,"Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures."
231130,L411565,u6857,m458,GIBBY,Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
231131,L411531,u6857,m458,GIBBY,Sometimes opposites attract.
231132,L411530,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,"wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different."
231133,L411507,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
231134,L411506,u6857,m458,GIBBY,"Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?"
231135,L411679,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Rosalind and Orlando.  From ""As You Like It""?  Shakespeare?"
231136,L411678,u6857,m458,GIBBY,Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
231137,L411624,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Betty.
231138,L411623,u6857,m458,GIBBY,Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
231139,L411581,u6857,m458,GIBBY,By Guy?
231140,L411580,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Do I want to be crunched?
231141,L411579,u6857,m458,GIBBY,He is totally crunching on you.
231142,L411568,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Why?
231143,L411567,u6857,m458,GIBBY,: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
231144,L411562,u6857,m458,GIBBY,You crossed over.
231145,L411561,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Transitioned?
231146,L411560,u6857,m458,GIBBY,"Josie, you have totally transitioned."
231147,L411513,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft."
231148,L411512,u6857,m458,GIBBY,I think it's pronounced gauche.
231149,L411152,u6857,m458,GIBBY,Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
231150,L411151,u6860,m458,JOSIE,That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
231151,L411778,u6858,m458,GUS,I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
231152,L411777,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story."
231153,L411776,u6858,m458,GUS,Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
231154,L411660,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
231155,L411659,u6858,m458,GUS,Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
231156,L411658,u6860,m458,JOSIE,There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
231157,L411657,u6858,m458,GUS,"And that's the best part.  ""Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?"" We're gonna blow the lid off it!"
231158,L411656,u6860,m458,JOSIE,He's my teacher!
231159,L411655,u6858,m458,GUS,"It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--"
231160,L411654,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
231161,L411653,u6858,m458,GUS,That's your story!
231162,L411343,u6858,m458,GUS,I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
231163,L411342,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What if I say no?
231164,L411341,u6858,m458,GUS,"No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story."
231165,L411340,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Gus?
231166,L411303,u6858,m458,GUS,OUT!
231167,L411302,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
231168,L411301,u6858,m458,GUS,Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
231169,L411300,u6860,m458,JOSIE,They hid my car--
231170,L411299,u6858,m458,GUS,Do you even know these kids?
231171,L411298,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this."
231172,L411297,u6858,m458,GUS,"This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!"
231173,L411296,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Well, how would you define to parties""? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--"
231174,L411295,u6858,m458,GUS,Have you been to any parties?
231175,L411294,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Uhh, no."
231176,L411293,u6858,m458,GUS,Have you been there?
231177,L411292,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go."
231178,L411291,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Kristen got a quote?
231179,L411290,u6858,m458,GUS,"Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call ""The Court."" Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, ""Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."""
231180,L411289,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh. Right.
231181,L411288,u6858,m458,GUS,"No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune."
231182,L411203,u6858,m458,GUS,"Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!"
231183,L411202,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--"
231184,L411201,u6858,m458,GUS,And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
231185,L411200,u6860,m458,JOSIE,It's an expose on cafeteria food.
231186,L411199,u6858,m458,GUS,"You're a sick puppy, Geller."
231187,L411198,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too."
231188,L411033,u6858,m458,GUS,"Geller, this is way out of your league."
231189,L411032,u6860,m458,JOSIE,But I don't want it straightened out.
231190,L411031,u6858,m458,GUS,"Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out."
231191,L410952,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Hey--I can be out of control.
231192,L410951,u6858,m458,GUS,"Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five."
231193,L410950,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
231194,L410949,u6858,m458,GUS,"Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls."
231195,L410948,u6860,m458,JOSIE,A--flack jacket.
231196,L410947,u6858,m458,GUS,A flack jacket.
231197,L410946,u6860,m458,JOSIE,They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
231198,L410945,u6858,m458,GUS,You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
231199,L410944,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You've done five of my ideas.
231200,L410943,u6858,m458,GUS,"Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter."
231201,L410942,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good."
231202,L410941,u6858,m458,GUS,Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
231203,L410940,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
231204,L410939,u6858,m458,GUS,Eh.
231205,L410938,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Five-- Six--
231206,L410937,u6858,m458,GUS,How many times have I fired her?
231207,L410932,u6858,m458,GUS,So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
231208,L410931,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Well, excuse me for caring about words."
231209,L410930,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"It is hoped that it's not a mess. ""Hopefully"" is an adverb. It means ""with hope"". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings."
231210,L410929,u6858,m458,GUS,Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
231211,L411723,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You said that already.
231212,L411722,u6859,m458,GUY,"Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world."
231213,L411721,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh.
231214,L411720,u6859,m458,GUY,My sword.
231215,L411719,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--""Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold"".  What about you? What are you thinking about?"
231216,L411718,u6859,m458,GUY,Hey--what are you thinking about?
231217,L411689,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
231218,L411688,u6859,m458,GUY,You having fun?
231219,L411617,u6859,m458,GUY,Cool. I'll catch you later.
231220,L411616,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
231221,L411615,u6859,m458,GUY,Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
231222,L411614,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Yes. I'll go. Yes.
231223,L411613,u6859,m458,GUY,"I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-"
231224,L411610,u6859,m458,GUY,I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
231225,L411609,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Maybe we should go in a different room?
231226,L411603,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Hey. There.
231227,L411602,u6859,m458,GUY,Hey there.
231228,L411577,u6859,m458,GUY,"Yeah, you gonna be there?"
231229,L411576,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Rob's?
231230,L411430,u6859,m458,GUY,"Dude, you rock!"
231231,L411429,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh my god.
231232,L411157,u6859,m458,GUY,Are you in special ed?
231233,L411156,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
231234,L411598,u6867,m458,TRACY,I'm Rob's prom date.
231235,L411597,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Hey Rob, what's going on?"
231236,L411540,u6867,m458,TRACY,But I'm not a penguin.
231237,L411539,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives."
231238,L411538,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
231239,L411537,u6867,m458,TRACY,"You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time."
231240,L411536,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
231241,L411535,u6867,m458,TRACY,"God, I can't do this."
231242,L411775,u6864,m458,ROB,"No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up."
231243,L411774,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I-
231244,L411773,u6864,m458,ROB,"No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?"
231245,L411772,u6860,m458,JOSIE,wasn't even thinking about-
231246,L411771,u6864,m458,ROB,"No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age."
231247,L411770,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Really?
231248,L411769,u6864,m458,ROB,"Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay."
231249,L411668,u6864,m458,ROB,I know.
231250,L411667,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
231251,L411666,u6864,m458,ROB,"Duh. Tom Cruise. ""Risky Business""."
231252,L411665,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Thanks. And what are -
231253,L411664,u6864,m458,ROB,Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
231254,L411663,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Rufus?
231255,L411662,u6864,m458,ROB,"Wow, Josie- you look really-"
231256,L411601,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal."
231257,L411600,u6864,m458,ROB,And a gymnast!
231258,L411599,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen."
231259,L411427,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day."
231260,L411426,u6864,m458,ROB,"With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one."
231261,L411425,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You're twenty-three years old!
231262,L411424,u6864,m458,ROB,"This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!"
231263,L411423,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
231264,L411419,u6864,m458,ROB,"No. Josie, this is real."
231265,L411418,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
231266,L411331,u6864,m458,ROB,That's the spirit!
231267,L411330,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Better than I...
231268,L411329,u6864,m458,ROB,"Plus, if you quit you're no better than me."
231269,L411328,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Yes, desperately."
231270,L411327,u6864,m458,ROB,"Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?"
231271,L411326,u6864,m458,ROB,Little known fact.
231272,L411325,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Is that true?
231273,L411324,u6864,m458,ROB,"Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it."
231274,L411323,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
231275,L411322,u6864,m458,ROB,"Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore."
231276,L411321,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Rob. Please focus.
231277,L411320,u6864,m458,ROB,Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
231278,L411319,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South."
231279,L411318,u6864,m458,ROB,Why is that impossible?
231280,L411317,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
231281,L411316,u6864,m458,ROB,"These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!"
231282,L411315,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I can't do this.
231283,L411314,u6864,m458,ROB,"No, I mean, no big whoop."
231284,L411311,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Good.
231285,L411310,u6864,m458,ROB,No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
231286,L411309,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Are mom and dad here?
231287,L411062,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
231288,L411061,u6864,m458,ROB,I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
231289,L411060,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Josie Grossie.
231290,L411057,u6864,m458,ROB,Don't you remember what they called you?
231291,L411056,u6860,m458,JOSIE,It was a long time ago -
231292,L411055,u6864,m458,ROB,Do you remember high school?
231293,L411054,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What!?
231294,L411053,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
231295,L411052,u6864,m458,ROB,Wow. This must be big.
231296,L411050,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
231297,L411049,u6864,m458,ROB,"You can't just ""borrow"" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!"
231298,L411048,u6860,m458,JOSIE,It's just for a couple of months.
231299,L411003,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!"
231300,L411002,u6864,m458,ROB,Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
231301,L411001,u6860,m458,JOSIE,How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
231302,L411000,u6864,m458,ROB,Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
231303,L410999,u6860,m458,JOSIE,This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
231304,L410998,u6864,m458,ROB,"I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life."
231305,L410997,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--"
231306,L410996,u6864,m458,ROB,See!
231307,L410995,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Better person than I.
231308,L410994,u6864,m458,ROB,"No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your ""things that make you a better person than me"" list."
231309,L410993,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal."
231310,L410991,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
231311,L410990,u6864,m458,ROB,She just needs a new windshield wiper.
231312,L410989,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
231313,L410988,u6864,m458,ROB,No it's not. Guys name their penises.
231314,L410987,u6860,m458,JOSIE,That is so--weird that you name your car.
231315,L411836,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I finally found my story.
231316,L411835,u6865,m458,SAM,"I told you you could write, Josie Geller."
231317,L411768,u6865,m458,SAM,I just can't look at you the same way.
231318,L411767,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Please. Please don't walk away.
231319,L411766,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again."
231320,L411765,u6865,m458,SAM,The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
231321,L411764,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
231322,L411763,u6865,m458,SAM,Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
231323,L411762,u6860,m458,JOSIE,But now you don't have to--
231324,L411761,u6865,m458,SAM,You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
231325,L411760,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Wait, I was going to tell you--"
231326,L411759,u6865,m458,SAM,"Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical."
231327,L411758,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You were attracted to me?
231328,L411757,u6865,m458,SAM,What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
231329,L411756,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"No, surprise, I thought you'd be--"
231330,L411755,u6865,m458,SAM,"""Surprise!"" you were doing a story on me?!"
231331,L411737,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Yeah, I have."
231332,L411736,u6865,m458,SAM,So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
231333,L411734,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"It's weird because ""prom"" is actually from the word ""promenade"". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?"
231334,L411733,u6865,m458,SAM,"No, I'm alone."
231335,L411732,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Well, are you here with anybody?"
231336,L411731,u6865,m458,SAM,"Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on."
231337,L411725,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Thanks. So do you.
231338,L411724,u6865,m458,SAM,Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
231339,L411652,u6865,m458,SAM,"Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story."
231340,L411651,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Wow. You believe in me that much--
231341,L411650,u6865,m458,SAM,"told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!"
231342,L411649,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh--yikes!
231343,L411648,u6865,m458,SAM,"No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you."
231344,L411647,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
231345,L411646,u6865,m458,SAM,Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
231346,L411645,u6865,m458,SAM,"Yeah, actually I do."
231347,L411644,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Do you think you'll find her?
231348,L411643,u6865,m458,SAM,"Our penguin, right?"
231349,L411642,u6860,m458,JOSIE,To put us back together again when we fall.
231350,L411641,u6865,m458,SAM,Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
231351,L411640,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--"
231352,L411639,u6865,m458,SAM,"That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody."
231353,L411638,u6860,m458,JOSIE,But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
231354,L411637,u6865,m458,SAM,Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
231355,L411636,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?"
231356,L411635,u6865,m458,SAM,"You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your ""can do"" attitude."
231357,L411489,u6865,m458,SAM,I'm thinking when I'm home.
231358,L411488,u6860,m458,JOSIE,When are you going to open your eyes?
231359,L411487,u6865,m458,SAM,"Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought."
231360,L411486,u6865,m458,SAM,"I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher."
231361,L411485,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You have to say that. You're my teacher.
231362,L411482,u6860,m458,JOSIE,That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
231363,L411481,u6865,m458,SAM,"I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you."
231364,L411480,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Why do you do that?
231365,L411479,u6865,m458,SAM,"I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages."
231366,L411478,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I know.
231367,L411477,u6865,m458,SAM,Boys.
231368,L411475,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I don't have to say that.
231369,L411474,u6865,m458,SAM,You have to say that. You're my student.
231370,L411473,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
231371,L411472,u6865,m458,SAM,"God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all."
231372,L411471,u6860,m458,JOSIE,That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
231373,L411470,u6865,m458,SAM,Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
231374,L411467,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Don't look down!
231375,L411466,u6865,m458,SAM,Yoooooow.
231376,L411465,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Of course. I remember everything from your class.
231377,L411464,u6865,m458,SAM,You remember that story?
231378,L411463,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
231379,L411462,u6865,m458,SAM,"Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me."
231380,L411461,u6860,m458,JOSIE,You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
231381,L411460,u6865,m458,SAM,"I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights."
231382,L411459,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Are you--scared?
231383,L411457,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Thank you.
231384,L411456,u6865,m458,SAM,This seat taken?
231385,L411358,u6865,m458,SAM,"Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon""? How for her it was like a Concord grape. ""That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"""
231386,L411357,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
231387,L411356,u6865,m458,SAM,Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
231388,L411355,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding."
231389,L411354,u6865,m458,SAM,That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
231390,L411353,u6860,m458,JOSIE,College. Haven't really thought about it.
231391,L411352,u6865,m458,SAM,So what are you thinking for college?
231392,L411351,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Thank you.
231393,L411350,u6865,m458,SAM,"Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker."
231394,L411349,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Oh I don't think so.
231395,L411348,u6865,m458,SAM,"Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me."
231396,L411262,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--"
231397,L411261,u6865,m458,SAM,Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
231398,L411260,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"Sure, why?"
231399,L411259,u6865,m458,SAM,True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
231400,L411258,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?"
231401,L411257,u6865,m458,SAM,"Not the happiest of souls.  ""Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."""
231402,L411256,u6860,m458,JOSIE,I love the way she writes.
231403,L411255,u6865,m458,SAM,You like her?
231404,L411254,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Dorothy Parker--
231405,L411253,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Sorry. Forgetful.
231406,L411252,u6865,m458,SAM,Whoa. Deja Vu.
231407,L411119,u6860,m458,JOSIE,"I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie."
231408,L411118,u6865,m458,SAM,"Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam."
231409,L411239,u6866,m458,SHEILA,That's what I'm saying.
231410,L411238,u6860,m458,JOSIE,The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
231411,L411237,u6866,m458,SHEILA,I don't know.
231412,L411236,u6860,m458,JOSIE,Why?
231413,L411235,u6866,m458,SHEILA,Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
231414,L411234,u6860,m458,JOSIE,What?
231415,L411233,u6866,m458,SHEILA,Yes.
231416,L411746,u6861,m458,KIRSTEN,You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
231417,L411745,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,You ruined the whole thing!
231418,L411677,u6861,m458,KIRSTEN,Who are you guys?
231419,L411676,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,"Josie, you look Rufus."
231420,L411570,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,We're very evolved.
231421,L411569,u6861,m458,KIRSTEN,We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
231422,L411564,u6861,m458,KIRSTEN,It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
231423,L411563,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,Into our group.
231424,L411146,u6861,m458,KIRSTEN,Nah uh.
231425,L411145,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,"Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams."
231426,L411098,u6862,m458,KRISTEN,"I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid."
231427,L411097,u6861,m458,KIRSTEN,That is so sad --
231428,L410985,u6864,m458,ROB,"Relax, Monty. It's just my sister."
231429,L410984,u6863,m458,MONTY,Aloha! Welcome!
231430,L410983,u6864,m458,ROB,I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
231431,L410982,u6863,m458,MONTY,"Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!"
231432,L410981,u6864,m458,ROB,I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
231433,L410980,u6863,m458,MONTY,I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
231434,L410979,u6864,m458,ROB,Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
231435,L411702,u6867,m458,TRACY,"Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex."
231436,L411701,u6864,m458,ROB,Wow - I-
231437,L411698,u6864,m458,ROB,Maybe we should sit.
231438,L411697,u6867,m458,TRACY,Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
231439,L411696,u6864,m458,ROB,Yeah. Definitely.
231440,L411695,u6867,m458,TRACY,Are you having fun?
231441,L411608,u6867,m458,TRACY,"No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, ""hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post""?! Totally lame."
231442,L411607,u6864,m458,ROB,"Well, a ball player."
231443,L411606,u6867,m458,TRACY,"Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?"
231444,L411433,u6867,m458,TRACY,Duh.
231445,L411432,u6864,m458,ROB,Thank you.  I'm Rob.
231446,L411431,u6867,m458,TRACY,Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...

231458,L415166,u6868,m459,BARREL,Where're we taking him?

231466,L415080,u6868,m459,BARREL,Barrel.
231467,L415079,u6873,m459,SHOCK,Shock.
231468,L415046,u6872,m459,SALLY,Experiments?
231469,L415045,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,He's conducting experiments of his own.
231470,L415044,u6872,m459,SALLY,"When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him."
231471,L415043,u6872,m459,SALLY,He stayed a long time.
231472,L415042,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,Uh-huh.
231473,L414994,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,"I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--"
231474,L414993,u6872,m459,SALLY,Can't you make other creations?
231475,L414992,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,"Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father..."
231476,L414990,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,"Whatever it is, it's none of your concern."
231477,L414989,u6872,m459,SALLY,But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
231478,L414987,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
231479,L414986,u6872,m459,SALLY,I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
231480,L414985,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,Why not?
231481,L414984,u6872,m459,SALLY,No.
231482,L414983,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,Taste it.
231483,L414982,u6872,m459,SALLY,But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
231484,L414981,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,Taste it.
231485,L414980,u6872,m459,SALLY,Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
231486,L414979,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
231487,L414974,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,Good.  I'm hungry.
231488,L414973,u6872,m459,SALLY,Coming...
231489,L414933,u6872,m459,SALLY,"Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it."
231490,L414932,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,Just what?
231491,L414931,u6872,m459,SALLY,"That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just..."
231492,L414930,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,But I guess my best just isn't good enough.

231497,L414925,u6869,m459,EVIL SCIENTIST,"Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?"
231498,L414924,u6872,m459,SALLY,I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.

231531,L416743,u6878,m460,JESSE,What are you talking about?

231551,L416863,u6881,m460,MOM,He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.

231559,L417039,u6876,m460,FREDDY,He'll die with me!
231560,L417038,u6880,m460,LISA,He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
231561,L417037,u6876,m460,FREDDY,I'll kill you now.

231575,L416961,u6877,m460,GRADY,What?
231576,L416950,u6878,m460,JESSE,"Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave."
231577,L416949,u6877,m460,GRADY,"Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?"
231578,L416948,u6878,m460,JESSE,No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
231579,L416947,u6877,m460,GRADY,"I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?"
231580,L416946,u6878,m460,JESSE,"Look, I don't care if you believe me or not..."
231581,L416945,u6877,m460,GRADY,The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
231582,L416944,u6878,m460,JESSE,"I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body."
231583,L416943,u6877,m460,GRADY,You're fucked in the head.
231584,L416937,u6878,m460,JESSE,"Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad."
231585,L416936,u6877,m460,GRADY,Are you nuts or something?
231586,L416935,u6878,m460,JESSE,"You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady."

231591,L416892,u6877,m460,GRADY,"You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case."
231592,L416879,u6877,m460,GRADY,He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
231593,L416878,u6878,m460,JESSE,Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
231594,L416797,u6877,m460,GRADY,Only the wet ones.
231595,L416796,u6878,m460,JESSE,"You remember your dreams, Grady?"
231596,L416795,u6878,m460,JESSE,Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
231597,L416794,u6877,m460,GRADY,"Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today."
231598,L416793,u6878,m460,JESSE,Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
231599,L416792,u6877,m460,GRADY,No shit.
231600,L416791,u6878,m460,JESSE,"My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college."
231601,L416790,u6877,m460,GRADY,Who told you to choke up that way?
231602,L416789,u6878,m460,JESSE,It was okay.
231603,L416788,u6877,m460,GRADY,"You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh."
231604,L416654,u6877,m460,GRADY,They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
231605,L416653,u6878,m460,JESSE,What the hell are you talking about?
231606,L416652,u6877,m460,GRADY,"Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump."
231607,L416651,u6878,m460,JESSE,"Yeah, why?"
231608,L416650,u6877,m460,GRADY,Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
231609,L416649,u6878,m460,JESSE,Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
231610,L416648,u6877,m460,GRADY,"So, you live around here."
231611,L416646,u6877,m460,GRADY,Naw. Just killing time.
231612,L416645,u6878,m460,JESSE,"You got a problem with me, Grady?"
231613,L416644,u6877,m460,GRADY,She giving you any carfare for the ride?
231614,L416643,u6878,m460,JESSE,"She's a neighbor, I drive her to school."
231615,L416642,u6877,m460,GRADY,"You two got a thing going, or what?"
231616,L416641,u6878,m460,JESSE,What about it?
231617,L416640,u6877,m460,GRADY,"So, what about you and that Poletti girl?"
231618,L416639,u6878,m460,JESSE,Get outa here.
231619,L416638,u6877,m460,GRADY,Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
231620,L416637,u6878,m460,JESSE,How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
231621,L417044,u6880,m460,LISA,We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
231622,L417043,u6878,m460,JESSE,What's so funny?
231623,L417042,u6880,m460,LISA,Hi.
231624,L417041,u6878,m460,JESSE,Hi.
231625,L416990,u6878,m460,JESSE,I can't!
231626,L416989,u6880,m460,LISA,"You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!"
231627,L416975,u6880,m460,LISA,"No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up."
231628,L416974,u6878,m460,JESSE,"Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again."
231629,L416973,u6880,m460,LISA,Who?  Who's doing this to you?
231630,L416972,u6878,m460,JESSE,he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
231631,L416971,u6880,m460,LISA,"Who, Jesse?"
231632,L416970,u6878,m460,JESSE,"I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me..."
231633,L416969,u6880,m460,LISA,"Oh, Christ, you're hurt..."
231634,L416968,u6878,m460,JESSE,I killed him!  I killed him!
231635,L416967,u6880,m460,LISA,"Jesse, God - what happened?"
231636,L416925,u6880,m460,LISA,We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
231637,L416924,u6878,m460,JESSE,"I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure."
231638,L416922,u6878,m460,JESSE,What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
231639,L416921,u6880,m460,LISA,You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
231640,L416920,u6878,m460,JESSE,Will you leave me alone?  Please.
231641,L416919,u6880,m460,LISA,Why won't you talk to me?
231642,L416918,u6878,m460,JESSE,I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
231643,L416891,u6878,m460,JESSE,There's nothing to figure out.
231644,L416890,u6880,m460,LISA,"I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together."
231645,L416889,u6878,m460,JESSE,I'm not hungry.
231646,L416888,u6880,m460,LISA,You should eat something - you'll feel better.
231647,L416874,u6878,m460,JESSE,"My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her."
231648,L416873,u6880,m460,LISA,You want to talk about it?
231649,L416872,u6878,m460,JESSE,"yeah, I had a bad night."
231650,L416871,u6880,m460,LISA,"you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?"
231651,L416870,u6878,m460,JESSE,I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
231652,L416869,u6880,m460,LISA,Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
231653,L416848,u6880,m460,LISA,"Oh, Jesse..."
231654,L416847,u6878,m460,JESSE,It's gone now.
231655,L416846,u6878,m460,JESSE,I don't know - a sharp pain.
231656,L416845,u6880,m460,LISA,What is it?
231657,L416844,u6878,m460,JESSE,Whoa!
231658,L416843,u6880,m460,LISA,What is it - What's wrong?

231660,L416841,u6878,m460,JESSE,Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
231661,L416840,u6880,m460,LISA,"Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course."
231662,L416839,u6878,m460,JESSE,"Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep."

231682,L416815,u6880,m460,LISA,Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
231683,L416814,u6878,m460,JESSE,What is this place?
231684,L416813,u6880,m460,LISA,It's a surprise.

231686,L416811,u6880,m460,LISA,"What about ""essential energy"" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?"

231694,L416803,u6880,m460,LISA,"At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to ""the other world"" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals."
231695,L416801,u6880,m460,LISA,"Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride."

231703,L416768,u6878,m460,JESSE,That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
231704,L416766,u6878,m460,JESSE,"Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it."

232028,L417512,u6889,m461,NANCY,Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
232029,L417511,u6893,m461,TARYN,"What'd you do, take the scenic route?"
232030,L417370,u6889,m461,NANCY,"Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong."
232031,L417369,u6893,m461,TARYN,Who is he?
232032,L417192,u6893,m461,TARYN,"Hey, everybody has bad dreams."
232033,L417191,u6889,m461,NANCY,Your dreams?
232034,L417190,u6893,m461,TARYN,"I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit."
232035,L417282,u6889,m461,NANCY,"Neil, please --"
232036,L417281,u6892,m461,SIMMS,That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
232037,L417280,u6889,m461,NANCY,You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
232038,L417279,u6892,m461,SIMMS,We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
232039,L417198,u6892,m461,SIMMS,The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
232040,L417197,u6889,m461,NANCY,And what are they?
232041,L417196,u6892,m461,SIMMS,And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
232042,L417605,u6894,m461,THOMPSON,No.  We're alone.
232043,L417604,u6890,m461,NEIL,Somebody else is out here.
232044,L417603,u6894,m461,THOMPSON,Listen.
232045,L417602,u6890,m461,NEIL,What?
232046,L417601,u6894,m461,THOMPSON,What was that?
232047,L417535,u6890,m461,NEIL,You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
232048,L417534,u6894,m461,THOMPSON,What are you talking about?
232049,L417533,u6890,m461,NEIL,We've got work to do.
232050,L417517,u6894,m461,THOMPSON,They used to keep a spare key.
232051,L417516,u6890,m461,NEIL,How do we get in?
232052,L417515,u6894,m461,THOMPSON,In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
232053,L417450,u6891,m461,NUN,You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
232054,L417449,u6890,m461,NEIL,You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
232055,L417448,u6891,m461,NUN,"The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found."
232056,L417447,u6890,m461,NEIL,Freddy.
232057,L417446,u6891,m461,NUN,That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
232058,L417445,u6890,m461,NEIL,My God.
232059,L417444,u6891,m461,NUN,"A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child."
232060,L417443,u6890,m461,NEIL,"The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal..."
232061,L417442,u6891,m461,NUN,"Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals."
232062,L417441,u6890,m461,NEIL,This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
232063,L417346,u6890,m461,NEIL,I beg your pardon?
232064,L417345,u6891,m461,NUN,Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
232065,L417344,u6890,m461,NEIL,I could've saved them.
232066,L417343,u6891,m461,NUN,I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
232067,L417342,u6890,m461,NEIL,You do volunteer work at the hospital?
232068,L417341,u6891,m461,NUN,Mary Helena.
232069,L417340,u6890,m461,NEIL,There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
232070,L417339,u6891,m461,NUN,A sad choice.
232071,L417338,u6890,m461,NEIL,Science...I suppose.
232072,L417435,u6892,m461,SIMMS,Of course.
232073,L417434,u6890,m461,NEIL,"For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them."
232074,L417433,u6892,m461,SIMMS,"I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself."
232075,L417287,u6890,m461,NEIL,I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
232076,L417286,u6892,m461,SIMMS,I won't allow it.
232077,L417285,u6890,m461,NEIL,Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
232078,L417284,u6892,m461,SIMMS,I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
232079,L417283,u6890,m461,NEIL,"Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant."
232080,L417273,u6892,m461,SIMMS,"There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody."
232081,L417272,u6890,m461,NEIL,"That's enough, Kincaid."
232082,L417181,u6892,m461,SIMMS,"Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome."
232083,L417180,u6890,m461,NEIL,"Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room."
232084,L417093,u6890,m461,NEIL,"Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published."
232085,L417092,u6892,m461,SIMMS,She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
232086,L417091,u6890,m461,NEIL,"Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro."
232087,L417090,u6892,m461,SIMMS,What did you think?
232088,L417087,u6890,m461,NEIL,"Don't worry, it won't come to that."
232089,L417086,u6892,m461,SIMMS,"If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently."
232090,L417085,u6890,m461,NEIL,Cooling down.
232091,L417084,u6892,m461,SIMMS,How is he?
232092,L417526,u6893,m461,TARYN,Me too.
232093,L417525,u6895,m461,WILL,I'm in.
232094,L417395,u6893,m461,TARYN,Where...here?
232095,L417394,u6895,m461,WILL,We're here.
232096,L417375,u6893,m461,TARYN,"Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  ""Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."""
232097,L417374,u6895,m461,WILL,Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
232098,L417372,u6893,m461,TARYN,Yeah?  What did we ever do?
232099,L417371,u6895,m461,WILL,Why is he after us?
232100,L417211,u6893,m461,TARYN,I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
232101,L417210,u6895,m461,WILL,"Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?"
232102,L417209,u6893,m461,TARYN,"In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone."
232103,L417208,u6895,m461,WILL,C'mon.
232104,L417207,u6893,m461,TARYN,This is stupid.
232105,L417206,u6895,m461,WILL,Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
232106,L417205,u6893,m461,TARYN,"Uh, fourteen."
232107,L417204,u6895,m461,WILL,"Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead."
232108,L417184,u6893,m461,TARYN,Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
232109,L417183,u6895,m461,WILL,"I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see."
232110,L422763,u6897,m462,BELLA,And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
232111,L422762,u6896,m462,ANNA,Lovely to meet you.
232112,L422728,u6897,m462,BELLA,Oh God.
232113,L422727,u6896,m462,ANNA,I'm a vegetarian.
232114,L422726,u6897,m462,BELLA,What do you think of the guinea fowl?
232115,L422717,u6897,m462,BELLA,"Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right."
232116,L422716,u6896,m462,ANNA,I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
232117,L422676,u6897,m462,BELLA,Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
232118,L422675,u6896,m462,ANNA,Hi.
232119,L422765,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Night, night, Honey."
232120,L422764,u6906,m462,MAX,No!
232121,L422761,u6896,m462,ANNA,You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
232122,L422760,u6906,m462,MAX,Now you're lying.
232123,L422759,u6896,m462,ANNA,And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
232124,L422758,u6906,m462,MAX,I'm delighted.
232125,L422757,u6896,m462,ANNA,That was such a great evening.
232126,L422749,u6896,m462,ANNA,Well... a shot at it.
232127,L422748,u6906,m462,MAX,I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
232128,L422747,u6896,m462,ANNA,Wait a minute.  What about me?
232129,L423173,u6896,m462,ANNA,Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
232130,L423172,u6901,m462,JAMES,Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
232131,L423171,u6896,m462,ANNA,And then I... right.
232132,L423170,u6901,m462,JAMES,'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
232133,L423169,u6896,m462,ANNA,"So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?"
232134,L423168,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet."
232135,L423167,u6901,m462,JAMES,"No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed."
232136,L423166,u6896,m462,ANNA,I'm not listening.
232137,L423165,u6901,m462,JAMES,"God, that's an enormous arse."
232138,L423164,u6901,m462,JAMES,"Oh, stop showing off."
232139,L423163,u6896,m462,ANNA,We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
232140,L423162,u6901,m462,JAMES,We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
232141,L422714,u6898,m462,BERNIE,Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
232142,L422713,u6896,m462,ANNA,Fifteen million dollars.
232143,L422712,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?"
232144,L422711,u6896,m462,ANNA,Films mainly.
232145,L422710,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?"
232146,L422709,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, they can be."
232147,L422708,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?"
232148,L422707,u6896,m462,ANNA,I'm an actress.
232149,L422706,u6898,m462,BERNIE,So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
232150,L423310,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
232151,L423309,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes, I'm pretty sure I would."
232152,L423303,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,And what would you say...
232153,L423302,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't."
232154,L423226,u6896,m462,ANNA,Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
232155,L423225,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
232156,L423224,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?"
232157,L423223,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically."
232158,L423222,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,The truth is...
232159,L423221,u6896,m462,ANNA,"... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you."
232160,L423220,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
232161,L423218,u6896,m462,ANNA,That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
232162,L423217,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Sorry about that.
232163,L423204,u6896,m462,ANNA,You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
232164,L423203,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
232165,L423202,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again."
232166,L423201,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You were saying...
232167,L423198,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,What's the thing?
232168,L423197,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ..."
232169,L423196,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway."
232170,L423195,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed."
232171,L423194,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Thank you.  Shall I...
232172,L423193,u6896,m462,ANNA,I thought I'd give it to you.
232173,L423192,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and..."
232174,L423191,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ..."
232175,L423190,u6896,m462,ANNA,Well... how have you been?
232176,L423189,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
232177,L423188,u6896,m462,ANNA,You disappeared.
232178,L423187,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Hello.
232179,L423186,u6896,m462,ANNA,Hi.
232180,L423155,u6896,m462,ANNA,Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
232181,L423154,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Okay.
232182,L423153,u6896,m462,ANNA,But... wait... there are things to say.
232183,L423152,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
232184,L423151,u6896,m462,ANNA,It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
232185,L423149,u6896,m462,ANNA,I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
232186,L423148,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I only found out you were here yesterday.
232187,L423147,u6896,m462,ANNA,This is certainly... ah...
232188,L423099,u6896,m462,ANNA,You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
232189,L423098,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow."
232190,L423097,u6896,m462,ANNA,Excuse me?
232191,L423096,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
232192,L423095,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different."
232193,L423092,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter."
232194,L423091,u6896,m462,ANNA,And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
232195,L423088,u6896,m462,ANNA,I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
232196,L423087,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
232197,L423086,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott."
232198,L423085,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,That's spectacularly unfair.
232199,L423084,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'"
232200,L423083,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm..."
232201,L423082,u6896,m462,ANNA,As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
232202,L423081,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You do?
232203,L423080,u6896,m462,ANNA,"This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend."
232204,L423077,u6896,m462,ANNA,Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
232205,L423076,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,That's not true.
232206,L423075,u6896,m462,ANNA,I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
232207,L423074,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I don't know what happened.
232208,L423073,u6896,m462,ANNA,How do you think I'm doing?
232209,L423072,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,How are you doing?
232210,L423064,u6896,m462,ANNA,Jesus.
232211,L423063,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Undressed like this, yes."
232212,L423062,u6896,m462,ANNA,Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
232213,L423060,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Don't ask.
232214,L423059,u6896,m462,ANNA,What?
232215,L423056,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Damn, I forgot the jam."
232216,L423055,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Stay forever.
232217,L423054,u6896,m462,ANNA,Can I stay a bit longer?
232218,L423051,u6896,m462,ANNA,Oh.
232219,L423050,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
232220,L423049,u6896,m462,ANNA,Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
232221,L423048,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Who was Gilda?
232222,L423047,u6896,m462,ANNA,Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
232223,L423045,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look..."
232224,L423044,u6896,m462,ANNA,But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
232225,L423043,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair..."
232226,L423042,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them..."
232227,L423041,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Well...
232228,L423040,u6896,m462,ANNA,What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
232229,L423039,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
232230,L423038,u6896,m462,ANNA,You and every person in this country.
232231,L423037,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked."
232232,L423035,u6896,m462,ANNA,What?
232233,L423034,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Wow.
232234,L423033,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
232235,L423032,u6896,m462,ANNA,Okay.
232236,L423031,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh please sod off.
232237,L423014,u6896,m462,ANNA,Right.
232238,L423013,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed."
232239,L423012,u6896,m462,ANNA,Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
232240,L423011,u6896,m462,ANNA,Both.
232241,L423010,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
232242,L423009,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious."
232243,L423008,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
232244,L423007,u6896,m462,ANNA,Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
232245,L423006,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
232246,L423005,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I could have a stunt bottom, yes."
232247,L423004,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You have a stunt bottom?
232248,L423003,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'"
232249,L423002,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
232250,L423001,u6896,m462,ANNA,The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
232251,L423000,u6896,m462,ANNA,Big feet -- large shoes.
232252,L422999,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,No.  What's that?
232253,L422998,u6896,m462,ANNA,You know what they say about men with big feet?
232254,L422997,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes.  Always have had.
232255,L422996,u6896,m462,ANNA,You've got big feet.
232256,L422991,u6896,m462,ANNA,Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
232257,L422990,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,With a goat playing a violin.
232258,L422989,u6896,m462,ANNA,I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
232259,L422988,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You like Chagall?
232260,L422986,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,And I think the book is the poorer for it.
232261,L422985,u6896,m462,ANNA,Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
232262,L422984,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too."
232263,L422983,u6896,m462,ANNA,You think I should do Henry James instead?
232264,L422982,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping."
232265,L422981,u6896,m462,ANNA,What do you think?
232266,L422980,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
232267,L422979,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, get a message through to him too."
232268,L422978,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yup.
232269,L422977,u6896,m462,ANNA,My son's name is Johnny?
232270,L422976,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
232271,L422975,u6896,m462,ANNA,"'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'"
232272,L422974,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Cartwright.
232273,L422973,u6896,m462,ANNA,Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
232274,L422972,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Eleven.
232275,L422971,u6896,m462,ANNA,'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
232276,L422970,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'"
232277,L422969,u6896,m462,ANNA,"'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives."
232278,L422968,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
232279,L422967,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Well done you.
232280,L422966,u6896,m462,ANNA,I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
232281,L422965,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Hand it over.  Basic plot?
232282,L422964,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk."
232283,L422963,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Would you like me to take you through your lines?
232284,L422962,u6896,m462,ANNA,Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
232285,L422961,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
232286,L422960,u6896,m462,ANNA,Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
232287,L422959,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh no no -- no.
232288,L422958,u6896,m462,ANNA,I have thought about you.
232289,L422957,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer."
232290,L422956,u6896,m462,ANNA,I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
232291,L422955,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?"
232292,L422954,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again."
232293,L422948,u6896,m462,ANNA,A bath would be great.
232294,L422947,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
232295,L422946,u6896,m462,ANNA,These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
232296,L422945,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be."
232297,L422944,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,This is the place.
232298,L422943,u6896,m462,ANNA,I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
232299,L422941,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Come in.
232300,L422940,u6896,m462,ANNA,Hi.  Can I come in?
232301,L422887,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I think goodbye is traditional.
232302,L422886,u6896,m462,ANNA,I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
232303,L422885,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize..."
232304,L422860,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Your boyfriend?
232305,L422859,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room."
232306,L422858,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Why?
232307,L422857,u6896,m462,ANNA,You've got to go.
232308,L422856,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
232309,L422852,u6896,m462,ANNA,There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
232310,L422851,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
232311,L422850,u6896,m462,ANNA,Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
232312,L422849,u6896,m462,ANNA,I don't know either.
232313,L422848,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I don't know, I'm afraid."
232314,L422847,u6896,m462,ANNA,I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
232315,L422846,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, you were brilliant"
232316,L422845,u6896,m462,ANNA,I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
232317,L422837,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same."
232318,L422836,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I'm sorry.
232319,L422820,u6896,m462,ANNA,Uh-oh.  That's not good.
232320,L422819,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,She saw through me.
232321,L422818,u6896,m462,ANNA,Why?
232322,L422817,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,She left me.
232323,L422816,u6896,m462,ANNA,So who left who?
232324,L422800,u6896,m462,ANNA,Step aside.
232325,L422799,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
232326,L422797,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Exactly.  Here we go again.
232327,L422796,u6896,m462,ANNA,"There's no 'unless.'  No one has said ""whoopsidaisies"" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets."
232328,L422795,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're..."
232329,L422794,u6896,m462,ANNA,You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
232330,L422793,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, I didn't."
232331,L422792,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes, you did."
232332,L422791,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Nothing.
232333,L422790,u6896,m462,ANNA,What did you say?
232334,L422789,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Whoopsidaisies.
232335,L422787,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Ahm...
232336,L422786,u6896,m462,ANNA,You abide by rules like that?
232337,L422785,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
232338,L422784,u6896,m462,ANNA,Let's go in.
232339,L422783,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
232340,L422781,u6896,m462,ANNA,I was.
232341,L422780,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I thought you were leaving.
232342,L422779,u6896,m462,ANNA,Busy tomorrow?
232343,L422778,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,That's fine.
232344,L422777,u6896,m462,ANNA,Too complicated.
232345,L422775,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it."
232346,L422774,u6896,m462,ANNA,And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
232347,L422773,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
232348,L422772,u6896,m462,ANNA,Why is she in a wheelchair?
232349,L422771,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
232350,L422770,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Floppy, huh?"
232351,L422751,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this..."
232352,L422750,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
232353,L422665,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Okay.
232354,L422664,u6896,m462,ANNA,Okay.
232355,L422663,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something."
232356,L422662,u6896,m462,ANNA,If that's all right.
232357,L422661,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
232358,L422660,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date."
232359,L422659,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"But no, I'm sure I can get out of it."
232360,L422658,u6896,m462,ANNA,Okay -- fine.
232361,L422657,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner."
232362,L422656,u6896,m462,ANNA,Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
232363,L422620,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
232364,L422619,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice."
232365,L422618,u6896,m462,ANNA,Yes.
232366,L422617,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Are you busy tonight?
232367,L422611,u6896,m462,ANNA,And what happens next in the dream?
232368,L422610,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you."
232369,L422606,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Absolutely fine about it.
232370,L422605,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it."
232371,L422604,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
232372,L422603,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Obviously.  Very difficult.
232373,L422602,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space."
232374,L422601,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
232375,L422595,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi."
232376,L422594,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
232377,L422592,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I brought these, but clearly..."
232378,L422591,u6896,m462,ANNA,Hello.
232379,L422590,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Hi.
232380,L422568,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
232381,L422567,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good."
232382,L422566,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
232383,L422565,u6896,m462,ANNA,Oh -- Okay.
232384,L422564,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message."
232385,L422563,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call."
232386,L422562,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop."
232387,L422561,u6896,m462,ANNA,Hi.
232388,L422560,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
232389,L422507,u6896,m462,ANNA,Bye.
232390,L422506,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it."
232391,L422505,u6896,m462,ANNA,Probably best not tell anyone about this.
232392,L422499,u6896,m462,ANNA,Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
232393,L422498,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
232394,L422497,u6896,m462,ANNA,Thanks.  Well...
232395,L422496,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Here we go.
232396,L422495,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh right.
232397,L422494,u6896,m462,ANNA,I forgot my bag.
232398,L422493,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh hi.  Forget something?
232399,L422489,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
232400,L422488,u6896,m462,ANNA,Thank you.
232401,L422486,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly."
232402,L422485,u6896,m462,ANNA,No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
232403,L422484,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Do you always say 'no' to everything?
232404,L422483,u6896,m462,ANNA,No.
232405,L422482,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them."
232406,L422481,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Really, no."
232407,L422480,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?"
232408,L422479,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Orange juice -- probably not.
232409,L422478,u6896,m462,ANNA,No.
232410,L422477,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Coffee?
232411,L422476,u6896,m462,ANNA,No thanks.
232412,L422475,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
232413,L422471,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
232414,L422470,u6896,m462,ANNA,Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
232415,L422469,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
232416,L422468,u6896,m462,ANNA,No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
232417,L422467,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up."
232418,L422465,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Here, let me help."
232419,L422464,u6896,m462,ANNA,Oh Jesus.
232420,L422435,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune."
232421,L422434,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see."
232422,L422433,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Sorry about that...
232423,L422418,u6896,m462,ANNA,Thanks.  I'll think about it.
232424,L422417,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab."
232425,L422416,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes.  This one though is... very good.
232426,L422415,u6896,m462,ANNA,Really?
232427,L422414,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money."
232428,L422413,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Fine.
232429,L422412,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, thanks.  I'll just look around."
232430,L422883,u6902,m462,JEFF,"Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."""
232431,L422882,u6896,m462,ANNA,I haven't decided.
232432,L422881,u6902,m462,JEFF,Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
232433,L422880,u6896,m462,ANNA,Nice surprise.
232434,L422879,u6902,m462,JEFF,"Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?"
232435,L422875,u6902,m462,JEFF,I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
232436,L422874,u6896,m462,ANNA,Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
232437,L422862,u6902,m462,JEFF,Who is it?
232438,L422861,u6896,m462,ANNA,Yes...
232439,L422444,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Tempting but... no, thank you."
232440,L422443,u6911,m462,THIEF,Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
232441,L422442,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'"
232442,L422441,u6911,m462,THIEF,What does it say?
232443,L422440,u6911,m462,THIEF,Rufus.
232444,L422439,u6896,m462,ANNA,What's your name?
232445,L422438,u6911,m462,THIEF,Can I have your autograph?
232446,L422437,u6896,m462,ANNA,Yes.
232447,L422436,u6911,m462,THIEF,Excuse me.
232448,L423214,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'"
232449,L423213,u6905,m462,MARTIN,Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
232450,L423212,u6896,m462,ANNA,I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
232451,L423211,u6905,m462,MARTIN,Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
232452,L423210,u6896,m462,ANNA,Is that right?
232453,L423209,u6905,m462,MARTIN,"Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film."
232454,L423258,u6897,m462,BELLA,Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
232455,L423257,u6906,m462,MAX,"Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner."
232456,L423256,u6897,m462,BELLA,Where are you going?
232457,L422907,u6906,m462,MAX,And this is William.
232458,L422906,u6897,m462,BELLA,That's right.
232459,L422670,u6906,m462,MAX,"Christ, what is going on in there?"
232460,L422669,u6897,m462,BELLA,He wouldn't say.
232461,L422668,u6906,m462,MAX,Does the girl have a name?
232462,L422667,u6897,m462,BELLA,Miracles do happen.
232463,L422666,u6906,m462,MAX,He's bringing a girl?
232464,L423117,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap."
232465,L423116,u6897,m462,BELLA,No!
232466,L423115,u6898,m462,BERNIE,... get fired.
232467,L423114,u6897,m462,BELLA,"I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us..."
232468,L422743,u6897,m462,BELLA,"C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie."
232469,L422742,u6898,m462,BERNIE,No.  Not true...
232470,L422724,u6898,m462,BERNIE,Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
232471,L422723,u6897,m462,BELLA,Yup.
232472,L422722,u6898,m462,BERNIE,The movie star?
232473,L422721,u6897,m462,BELLA,Yes.
232474,L422720,u6898,m462,BERNIE,Anna Scott?
232475,L422719,u6897,m462,BELLA,"Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?"
232476,L423241,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Yes, I think that one may be."
232477,L423240,u6897,m462,BELLA,"This painting isn't the original, is it?"
232478,L423232,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Tony -- what do you think?
232479,L423231,u6897,m462,BELLA,Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
232480,L422939,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
232481,L422938,u6897,m462,BELLA,Do you want to stay?
232482,L422937,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch."
232483,L422936,u6897,m462,BELLA,I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
232484,L422935,u6897,m462,BELLA,I never fancied you much actually...
232485,L422934,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,In a depressingly asexual way.
232486,L422933,u6897,m462,BELLA,Still loves you though.
232487,L422678,u6897,m462,BELLA,Right.
232488,L422677,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Bella -- this is Anna.
232489,L422674,u6897,m462,BELLA,Don't even ask.
232490,L422673,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,He's cooking guinea fowl?
232491,L422672,u6897,m462,BELLA,Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
232492,L423266,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Is Miss Scott staying here?
232493,L423265,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"Bloody hell, this is fun."
232494,L423247,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."
232495,L423246,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it..."
232496,L423245,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,What?
232497,L423244,u6898,m462,BERNIE,That's nice.
232498,L423243,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes -- sort of...
232499,L423242,u6898,m462,BERNIE,But she said she wanted to go out with you?
232500,L422733,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will."
232501,L422732,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Bernie.
232502,L423252,u6906,m462,MAX,Where's Bella?
232503,L423251,u6898,m462,BERNIE,And we intend to use them!
232504,L423250,u6906,m462,MAX,If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
232505,L422731,u6906,m462,MAX,"I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here."
232506,L422730,u6898,m462,BERNIE,Shame!
232507,L422729,u6906,m462,MAX,"Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers."
232508,L422697,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you."
232509,L422696,u6906,m462,MAX,Bernie -- this is Anna.
232510,L422695,u6898,m462,BERNIE,"I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain."
232511,L422694,u6906,m462,MAX,"Hello, Bernie."
232512,L422651,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
232513,L422650,u6899,m462,GIRL,Di Caprio.
232514,L422649,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Da Vinci?
232515,L422648,u6899,m462,GIRL,Working with Leonardo.
232516,L422647,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
232517,L422646,u6899,m462,GIRL,No -- it's my 22nd.
232518,L422645,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Is this your first film?
232519,L423315,u6900,m462,HONEY,It was good.
232520,L423314,u6909,m462,SPIKE,What happened?
232521,L423239,u6909,m462,SPIKE,You daft prick!
232522,L423238,u6900,m462,HONEY,William has just turned down Anna Scott.
232523,L423237,u6909,m462,SPIKE,I was called and I came.  What's up?
232524,L423127,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Well, yes.  Groovy."
232525,L423126,u6900,m462,HONEY,Yes.  What do you think?
232526,L423125,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Me?
232527,L423124,u6900,m462,HONEY,By the way -- it's you.
232528,L423230,u6900,m462,HONEY,"Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there."
232529,L423229,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,What do you think?  Good move?
232530,L423108,u6900,m462,HONEY,"It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy."
232531,L423107,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, thanks, that's great."
232532,L423106,u6900,m462,HONEY,The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
232533,L423105,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Blimey.  What's that?
232534,L423104,u6900,m462,HONEY,Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
232535,L422687,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
232536,L422686,u6900,m462,HONEY,Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
232537,L422878,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Ahm... Bernie.
232538,L422877,u6902,m462,JEFF,What's your name?
232539,L422876,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Ah -- no.  It's fine.
232540,L422873,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right.
232541,L422872,u6902,m462,JEFF,And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
232542,L422871,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, I'm sure it'll be fine."
232543,L422870,u6902,m462,JEFF,Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
232544,L422869,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
232545,L422868,u6902,m462,JEFF,"Still, not sparkling."
232546,L422867,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I'll see what I can do.
232547,L422866,u6902,m462,JEFF,Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
232548,L422865,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call."
232549,L422864,u6902,m462,JEFF,How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
232550,L422863,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Ahm... room service.
232551,L423158,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,This is Henry James film?
232552,L423157,u6903,m462,KAREN,Are you a fan of Henry James?
232553,L422654,u6903,m462,KAREN,Have you got a moment?
232554,L422653,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes?
232555,L422652,u6903,m462,KAREN,Mr. Thacker?
232556,L422627,u6903,m462,KAREN,Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
232557,L422626,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,The others?
232558,L422625,u6903,m462,KAREN,If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
232559,L422582,u6903,m462,KAREN,Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
232560,L422581,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
232561,L422578,u6903,m462,KAREN,I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
232562,L422577,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I agree.
232563,L422635,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?"
232564,L422634,u6904,m462,MALE LEAD,"Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it."
232565,L422633,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Any bit in particular?
232566,L422632,u6904,m462,MALE LEAD,I did.
232567,L422631,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?"
232568,L422630,u6904,m462,MALE LEAD,"Well, fire away."
232569,L422629,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Ah... yes, enormously."
232570,L422628,u6904,m462,MALE LEAD,Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
232571,L423208,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?"
232572,L423207,u6905,m462,MARTIN,"I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color..."
232573,L423206,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
232574,L423205,u6905,m462,MARTIN,Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
232575,L423185,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?"
232576,L423184,u6905,m462,MARTIN,But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
232577,L423183,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?"
232578,L423182,u6905,m462,MARTIN,"I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery."
232579,L422524,u6905,m462,MARTIN,Can I help you?
232580,L422523,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Martin -- your customer.
232581,L422463,u6905,m462,MARTIN,"Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice."
232582,L422462,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right -- want another one?
232583,L422461,u6905,m462,MARTIN,"Not classic, no."
232584,L422460,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?"
232585,L422459,u6905,m462,MARTIN,I suppose so.
232586,L422458,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,So it could have been neither of them?
232587,L422457,u6905,m462,MARTIN,"No, well... he was quite a long way away."
232588,L422456,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
232589,L422455,u6905,m462,MARTIN,That's right -- Topol.
232590,L422454,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Topol.
232591,L422453,u6905,m462,MARTIN,"Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy."
232592,L422451,u6905,m462,MARTIN,Who?  Someone famous?
232593,L422450,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
232594,L422449,u6905,m462,MARTIN,Cappuccino as ordered.
232595,L422409,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford."
232596,L422408,u6905,m462,MARTIN,Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
232597,L422407,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
232598,L423236,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
232599,L423235,u6906,m462,MAX,Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
232600,L423139,u6906,m462,MAX,"So not over her, in fact."
232601,L423138,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh God no.
232602,L423137,u6906,m462,MAX,"Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath."
232603,L423136,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, don't think I do."
232604,L423135,u6906,m462,MAX,Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
232605,L423134,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I believe I have.
232606,L423133,u6906,m462,MAX,So -- you've laid the ghost.
232607,L423131,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
232608,L423130,u6906,m462,MAX,There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
232609,L423129,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth."
232610,L423128,u6906,m462,MAX,Any more announcements?
232611,L423122,u6906,m462,MAX,Is it someone we know?
232612,L423121,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
232613,L422932,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend."
232614,L422931,u6906,m462,MAX,That's not fair.
232615,L422930,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters."
232616,L422928,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"She's perfect, perfect."
232617,L422927,u6906,m462,MAX,Well?
232618,L422900,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Really?
232619,L422899,u6906,m462,MAX,Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
232620,L422898,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Buggered?
232621,L422897,u6906,m462,MAX,Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
232622,L422896,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine."
232623,L422895,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,No -- did you?
232624,L422894,u6906,m462,MAX,You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
232625,L422746,u6906,m462,MAX,"I think you do, yes."
232626,L422745,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,So I get the brownie?
232627,L422705,u6906,m462,MAX,You see -- it means 'yes.'
232628,L422704,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Definitely no comment.
232629,L422703,u6906,m462,MAX,Do you ever masturbate?
232630,L422702,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, it doesn't."
232631,L422701,u6906,m462,MAX,'No comment' means 'yes.'
232632,L422700,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment."
232633,L422699,u6906,m462,MAX,"You haven't slept with her, have you?"
232634,L422681,u6906,m462,MAX,"Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine."
232635,L422680,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Max.  This is Anna.
232636,L423272,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
232637,L423271,u6907,m462,RITZ MAN,"No, sir."
232638,L423270,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?"
232639,L423269,u6907,m462,RITZ MAN,"No, sir."
232640,L423268,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,How about Miss Flintstone?
232641,L423267,u6907,m462,RITZ MAN,"No, sir."
232642,L422553,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
232643,L422552,u6907,m462,RITZ MAN,"Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind."
232644,L422551,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake."
232645,L422550,u6907,m462,RITZ MAN,"I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir."
232646,L422549,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you..."
232647,L422548,u6907,m462,RITZ MAN,"May I help you, sir?"
232648,L422547,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Hello.
232649,L423146,u6908,m462,SECURITY,... can't let you through.
232650,L423145,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically..."
232651,L423144,u6908,m462,SECURITY,"I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir."
232652,L423143,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, no.  She doesn't."
232653,L423142,u6908,m462,SECURITY,Does she know you're coming?
232654,L423141,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
232655,L423140,u6908,m462,SECURITY,Can I help you?
232656,L423181,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
232657,L423180,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right -- let's talk about rent...
232658,L423179,u6909,m462,SPIKE,No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
232659,L423178,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I'm going to throw out these old videos.
232660,L423177,u6909,m462,SPIKE,What's going on?
232661,L423103,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right.
232662,L423102,u6909,m462,SPIKE,I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
232663,L423101,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Was it you?
232664,L423094,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective."
232665,L423093,u6909,m462,SPIKE,What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
232666,L423079,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry."
232667,L423078,u6909,m462,SPIKE,I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
232668,L423069,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Just take my work for it.
232669,L423068,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Why not?
232670,L423067,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I wouldn't go outside.
232671,L423030,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay."
232672,L423029,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,I'll talk to you in the morning.
232673,L423028,u6909,m462,SPIKE,No -- you're right.
232674,L423027,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Spike!
232675,L423026,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
232676,L423025,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
232677,L423024,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?"
232678,L423023,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes.
232679,L423022,u6909,m462,SPIKE,And you get on very well.
232680,L423021,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes.
232681,L423020,u6909,m462,SPIKE,And she's in your house.
232682,L423019,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Maybe.
232683,L423018,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?"
232684,L423017,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Spike.
232685,L423016,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
232686,L423015,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh my God...  Hello.
232687,L422995,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect."
232688,L422994,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?"
232689,L422891,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
232690,L422890,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend."
232691,L422889,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, okay.  There's this girl..."
232692,L422815,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Sort of.
232693,L422814,u6909,m462,SPIKE,You're welcome.  Did you find them?
232694,L422813,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
232695,L422812,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go."
232696,L422811,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?"
232697,L422810,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties."
232698,L422809,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"No, 'fraid not."
232699,L422808,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?"
232700,L422557,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
232701,L422556,u6909,m462,SPIKE,I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
232702,L422555,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,What?
232703,L422554,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Try 'Flintstone.'
232704,L422546,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
232705,L422545,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Which was?
232706,L422544,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name."
232707,L422543,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,What did she say?
232708,L422541,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Absolutely not.
232709,L422540,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Right.  No one else?
232710,L422539,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again."
232711,L422538,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
232712,L422537,u6909,m462,SPIKE,You want me to write down all your messages?
232713,L422536,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Two?  That's it?
232714,L422535,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Yeh, I wrote a couple down."
232715,L422534,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,So -- any messages?
232716,L422533,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
232717,L422532,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly."
232718,L422531,u6909,m462,SPIKE,There's something wrong with the goggles though...
232719,L422530,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey."
232720,L422529,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes."
232721,L422528,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
232722,L422527,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
232723,L422526,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Hi...
232724,L422525,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Hey.
232725,L422517,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Yes, she is fairly fabulous."
232726,L422516,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
232727,L422510,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic."
232728,L422509,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
232729,L422508,u6909,m462,SPIKE,There's something wrong with this yogurt.
232730,L422404,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Good luck.
232731,L422403,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
232732,L422402,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done."
232733,L422401,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
232734,L422400,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
232735,L422399,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Cool, huh?"
232736,L422397,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Point taken.
232737,L422396,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
232738,L422395,u6909,m462,SPIKE,Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
232739,L422394,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,What are the choices?
232740,L422393,u6909,m462,SPIKE,That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
232741,L422392,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?"
232742,L422391,u6909,m462,SPIKE,"Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?"
232743,L422623,u6910,m462,TARQUIN,Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
232744,L422622,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Fabulous.
232745,L422621,u6910,m462,TARQUIN,How was she?
232746,L422587,u6910,m462,TARQUIN,Oh sure.  Of course.
232747,L422586,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
232748,L422585,u6910,m462,TARQUIN,I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
232749,L422584,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
232750,L422573,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Oh.  Right.
232751,L422572,u6910,m462,TARQUIN,Yes.
232752,L422571,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Are you sure you...?
232753,L422570,u6910,m462,TARQUIN,Three.
232754,L422569,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Which floor?
232755,L422432,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec."
232756,L422431,u6911,m462,THIEF,Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
232757,L422430,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize."
232758,L422429,u6911,m462,THIEF,I haven't got a book down my trousers.
232759,L422428,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,The one down your trousers.
232760,L422427,u6911,m462,THIEF,What book?
232761,L422426,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,"So, I saw you put that book down your trousers."
232762,L422425,u6911,m462,THIEF,So?
232763,L422424,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
232764,L422423,u6911,m462,THIEF,What?
232765,L422422,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Bad news.
232766,L422421,u6911,m462,THIEF,Yes.
232767,L422420,u6912,m462,WILLIAM,Excuse me.
232768,L429135,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"No. Mister Harding, that is not true."
232769,L429134,u6919,m463,HARDING,Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
232770,L429133,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes, Mister Harding?"
232771,L428460,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect..."
232772,L428459,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes, Mister Harding?"
232773,L428275,u6919,m463,HARDING,"I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something..."
232774,L428274,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open..."
232775,L428255,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?"
232776,L428254,u6919,m463,HARDING,I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
232777,L428253,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Why?
232778,L428252,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Yes, that is correct."
232779,L428251,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,And yet you suspect her.
232780,L428250,u6919,m463,HARDING,"No, Miss Ratched..."
232781,L428249,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,But you have no proof.
232782,L428248,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct."
232783,L428247,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men."
232784,L428233,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?"
232785,L428232,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Yes, that's perfectly correct."
232786,L428231,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?"
232787,L429100,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Mister Washington.
232788,L429099,u6914,m463,BILLY,N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
232789,L429098,u6914,m463,BILLY,No! No! No!
232790,L429097,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Get up, Billy."
232791,L429094,u6914,m463,BILLY,M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
232792,L429093,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Who? Tell me!
232793,L429092,u6914,m463,BILLY,Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
232794,L429091,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly..."
232795,L429090,u6914,m463,BILLY,Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
232796,L429089,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
232797,L429088,u6914,m463,BILLY,"N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!"
232798,L429087,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
232799,L429086,u6914,m463,BILLY,"P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please..."
232800,L428561,u6914,m463,BILLY,I-I-I...
232801,L428560,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!"
232802,L428537,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?"
232803,L428536,u6914,m463,BILLY,I was in luh-love with her.
232804,L428535,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?"
232805,L428534,u6914,m463,BILLY,"I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing."
232806,L428533,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Tell us about it...
232807,L428532,u6914,m463,BILLY,Y-y-y-yes...
232808,L428531,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
232809,L428261,u6914,m463,BILLY,I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
232810,L428260,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes, Billy?"
232811,L428240,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Mister Sefelt?
232812,L428239,u6914,m463,BILLY,"N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am."
232813,L428238,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Would you like to start?
232814,L428237,u6914,m463,BILLY,M-m-m-ma'am?
232815,L428856,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Thank you, ma'am."
232816,L428855,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy."
232817,L428854,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Gotta go now, ma'am..."
232818,L428853,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Thank you, ma'am..."
232819,L428852,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure."
232820,L428851,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland."
232821,L428844,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much..."
232822,L428843,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Good. Why don't you join us?
232823,L428842,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!"
232824,L428841,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,I hope everything is settled.
232825,L428840,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Thank you, ma'am."
232826,L428839,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Welcome back.
232827,L428838,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yes, ma'am?"
232828,L428837,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Mister McMurphy.
232829,L428766,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"No, it was irresponsible!"
232830,L428765,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!"
232831,L428764,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!"
232832,L428763,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two."
232833,L428573,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
232834,L428572,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,You men remain seated!
232835,L428571,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
232836,L428570,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!..."
232837,L428558,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch..."
232838,L428557,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy."
232839,L428556,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
232840,L428555,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy."
232841,L428554,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,So do I!
232842,L428553,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight."
232843,L428552,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,That's it! We made it!
232844,L428551,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
232845,L428550,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts."
232846,L428549,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,A vote is before the group.
232847,L428548,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
232848,L428547,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?"
232849,L428546,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, it'll satisfy me."
232850,L428543,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
232851,L428542,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
232852,L428541,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!"
232853,L428540,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy."
232854,L428539,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business."
232855,L428538,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy."
232856,L428456,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,No way.
232857,L428455,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?"
232858,L428448,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!"
232859,L428447,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines."
232860,L428446,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Yeah?
232861,L428445,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!"
232862,L428444,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame."
232863,L428443,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Go on...
232864,L428442,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,I'm not finished yet.
232865,L428432,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Right!
232866,L428431,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Certainly, Mister McMurphy."
232867,L428430,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem."
232868,L428429,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes, Mister McMurphy."
232869,L428409,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
232870,L428408,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!"
232871,L428407,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast."
232872,L428406,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?"
232873,L428405,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy."
232874,L428400,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
232875,L428399,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,What for?
232876,L428398,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Oh, I had them removed."
232877,L428397,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!"
232878,L428396,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,On this ward?
232879,L428395,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,I wanna report a robbery!
232880,L428394,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels."
232881,L428377,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes."
232882,L428376,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may..."
232883,L428369,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Not at all, Mister McMurphy..."
232884,L428368,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Sorry to have bothered you.
232885,L428366,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window."
232886,L428365,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!"
232887,L428364,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy."
232888,L428363,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
232889,L428362,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes, Mister McMurphy?"
232890,L428361,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?"
232891,L428360,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Sorry, ma'am."
232892,L428359,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
232893,L428236,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy."
232894,L428235,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water..."
232895,L428234,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!"
232896,L428203,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam."
232897,L428202,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,"Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along."
232898,L428201,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse."
232899,L428200,u6913,m463,BIG NURSE,Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.

233086,L428870,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"I was open! Come on, let's play ball!"

233089,L428849,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah..."
233090,L428848,u6919,m463,HARDING,"What's your plan, Mack?"
233091,L428644,u6919,m463,HARDING,That's nice. Send me a post card.
233092,L428643,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,I'm busting outta this place.
233093,L428642,u6919,m463,HARDING,What for?
233094,L428641,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
233095,L428604,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!"
233096,L428603,u6919,m463,HARDING,It doesn't help him.
233097,L428602,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
233098,L428601,u6919,m463,HARDING,So why are you talking to him?
233099,L428600,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!"
233100,L428599,u6919,m463,HARDING,He can't hear you!
233101,L428517,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Just warmin' up.
233102,L428516,u6919,m463,HARDING,Giving up?
233103,L428515,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!"
233104,L428514,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Okay, sucker."
233105,L428513,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Okay, Harding, you're on."
233106,L428512,u6919,m463,HARDING,Twenty-five dollars.
233107,L428501,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,You heard me the first time!
233108,L428500,u6919,m463,HARDING,With your own two hands?
233109,L428499,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"You're fuckin' A-right, I am!"
233110,L428498,u6919,m463,HARDING,You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
233111,L428497,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!"
233112,L428486,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
233113,L428485,u6919,m463,HARDING,"And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?"
233114,L428477,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!"
233115,L428476,u6919,m463,HARDING,"A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend."
233116,L428475,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
233117,L428383,u6919,m463,HARDING,"She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady."
233118,L428382,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!"
233119,L428381,u6919,m463,HARDING,"I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?"
233120,L428380,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?"
233121,L428326,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Now, what would I be trying to say?"
233122,L428325,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
233123,L428324,u6919,m463,HARDING,That!
233124,L428323,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Lobotomy?
233125,L428322,u6919,m463,HARDING,Lobotomy!
233126,L428321,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,What for?
233127,L428320,u6919,m463,HARDING,"And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery."
233128,L428319,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
233129,L428318,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair."
233130,L428311,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy."
233131,L428310,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!"
233132,L428305,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
233133,L428304,u6919,m463,HARDING,Did to me?
233134,L428303,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!"
233135,L428302,u6919,m463,HARDING,"It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party."
233136,L428299,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?"
233137,L428298,u6919,m463,HARDING,A pecking party?
233138,L428297,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?"
233139,L428169,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,I'm seeing what a busy man does.
233140,L428168,u6919,m463,HARDING,What are you doing?
233141,L428139,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Your buddy is callin' ya.
233142,L428138,u6919,m463,HARDING,Martini!
233143,L428776,u6919,m463,HARDING,I'm not running a charity ward...
233144,L428775,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Why not?
233145,L428774,u6919,m463,HARDING,No!
233146,L428773,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Gimme a cigarette!
233147,L428178,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to."
233148,L428177,u6920,m463,MARTINI,No!
233149,L428176,u6919,m463,HARDING,Let me see your hand!
233150,L428175,u6920,m463,MARTINI,No!
233151,L428174,u6919,m463,HARDING,Don't you have any clubs?
233152,L429129,u6929,m463,SEFELT,Gary Blinker...
233153,L429128,u6919,m463,HARDING,Who told you that?
233154,L429127,u6929,m463,SEFELT,Yesterday...
233155,L429126,u6919,m463,HARDING,When?
233156,L429125,u6929,m463,SEFELT,McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
233157,L429124,u6919,m463,HARDING,Hear what?
233158,L429123,u6929,m463,SEFELT,Just wait till you hear...
233159,L429122,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Big king, too bad..."
233160,L428257,u6929,m463,SEFELT,What's he talkin' about?
233161,L428256,u6919,m463,HARDING,"Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife."
233162,L428897,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me."
233163,L428896,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Gimme the ball!
233164,L428894,u6920,m463,MARTINI,I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
233165,L428893,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Whadaya doin', there's no one there!"
233166,L428666,u6920,m463,MARTINI,No! I wanna go!
233167,L428665,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
233168,L428628,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Bye-bye.
233169,L428627,u6920,m463,MARTINI,"Yeah, Mac?"
233170,L428626,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!"
233171,L428509,u6920,m463,MARTINI,A nickel.
233172,L428508,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Right!
233173,L428464,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Hold it a minute.
233174,L428463,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes."
233175,L428385,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Me. Hit me!
233176,L428384,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?"
233177,L428351,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?"
233178,L428350,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Hit me!
233179,L428349,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?"
233180,L428348,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Hit me.
233181,L428347,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?"
233182,L428342,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Whadaya bet, Cheswick?"
233183,L428341,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Bet a nickel!
233184,L428340,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"That's a dime, Martini."
233185,L428339,u6920,m463,MARTINI,What's this?
233186,L428338,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"'Kay, place your bets."
233187,L428130,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change..."
233188,L428129,u6920,m463,MARTINI,Can you borrow me a dime?
233189,L428128,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, buddy?"
233190,L429132,u6928,m463,SCANLON,He is!
233191,L429131,u6920,m463,MARTINI,He's not!
233192,L429130,u6928,m463,SCANLON,Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
233193,L428746,u6920,m463,MARTINI,What is it?
233194,L428745,u6928,m463,SCANLON,Jesus God...
233195,L428742,u6920,m463,MARTINI,No.
233196,L428741,u6928,m463,SCANLON,My turn.
233197,L428726,u6920,m463,MARTINI,I'm hungry.
233198,L428725,u6928,m463,SCANLON,"Yeah, it's cold!"
233199,L428724,u6920,m463,MARTINI,I wanna go home!
233200,L428662,u6928,m463,SCANLON,Me too! Me too!
233201,L428661,u6920,m463,MARTINI,I wanna see it...
233202,L428575,u6928,m463,SCANLON,"Me, too! Me, too!"
233203,L428574,u6920,m463,MARTINI,I saw thum! I saw thum!
233204,L428328,u6920,m463,MARTINI,No. Me! Me!
233205,L428327,u6928,m463,SCANLON,Gimme the ball!
233206,L428900,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Replacement coming in! Harding out!
233207,L428899,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,Time out!
233208,L428898,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Time out!
233209,L428878,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,Time out!
233210,L428877,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out."
233211,L428596,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,We'll let you know.
233212,L428595,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,When?
233213,L428594,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here."
233214,L428593,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me."
233215,L428592,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton."
233216,L428591,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!"
233217,L428590,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,I'm afraid not.
233218,L428589,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'."
233219,L428588,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case."
233220,L428587,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all."
233221,L428586,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients."
233222,L428585,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin."
233223,L428584,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?"
233224,L428583,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here."
233225,L428582,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,How are you feeling?
233226,L428436,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
233227,L428435,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?"
233228,L428226,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,Good. Good.
233229,L428225,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"You bet, Doc!"
233230,L428224,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!"
233231,L428223,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"No, this is my first trip, Doc."
233232,L428222,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?"
233233,L428221,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Doc, what can I tell ya?"
233234,L428220,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
233235,L428219,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"That's correct, Doc ..."
233236,L428218,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,Arrested on an assault charge five times...
233237,L428217,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"I don't, Doc..."
233238,L428216,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?"
233239,L428215,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?"
233240,L428214,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?"
233241,L428213,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure..."
233242,L428212,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,I see...
233243,L428211,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal."
233244,L428210,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,In what way?
233245,L428209,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man."
233246,L428208,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,I see.
233247,L428207,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Poker!
233248,L428206,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Oh, what was that?"
233249,L428205,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was."
233250,L428103,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy."
233251,L428102,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"My, my... Ah, who are you?"
233252,L428101,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
233253,L428100,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,Is that so?
233254,L428098,u6930,m463,SPIVEY,"Oh, do you do much fishing?"
233255,L428097,u6921,m463,MCMURPHY,"Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute."

233443,L429014,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it..."
233444,L429013,u6927,m463,ROSE,"Oh, yeah..."
233445,L429012,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face."
233446,L429002,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean..."
233447,L429001,u6927,m463,ROSE,You ol' fucker!
233448,L429000,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first..."
233449,L428999,u6927,m463,ROSE,That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
233450,L428998,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick."
233451,L428997,u6927,m463,ROSE,He's dead.
233452,L428996,u6932,m463,TURKLE,Is he in an asylum?
233453,L428995,u6927,m463,ROSE,I thought so.
233454,L428994,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy."
233455,L428991,u6927,m463,ROSE,"Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck."
233456,L428990,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly."
233457,L428986,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down..."
233458,L428985,u6927,m463,ROSE,"Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene."
233459,L428980,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys."
233460,L428979,u6927,m463,ROSE,Are they dangerous when they're awake?
233461,L428978,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep."
233462,L428968,u6927,m463,ROSE,Is he one of the loonies?
233463,L428967,u6932,m463,TURKLE,"Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all..."
233464,L428966,u6927,m463,ROSE,That!
233465,L428965,u6932,m463,TURKLE,What?
233466,L428964,u6927,m463,ROSE,What's that?
233467,L428963,u6932,m463,TURKLE,What happened?
233468,L428961,u6932,m463,TURKLE,Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
233469,L428960,u6927,m463,ROSE,"Whew! Hiya, boys!"
233470,L430446,u6944,m464,KATE,"Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is."
233471,L430445,u6934,m464,BARTENDER,Your grandmother?
233472,L430444,u6944,m464,KATE,Of course not.
233473,L430443,u6934,m464,BARTENDER,Your mother.
233474,L430442,u6944,m464,KATE,"No, she wasn't my sister."
233475,L430441,u6934,m464,BARTENDER,She was your sister.
233476,L430437,u6934,m464,BARTENDER,Si.
233477,L430436,u6944,m464,KATE,"Yes, but...  He was having an affair."
233478,L430435,u6934,m464,BARTENDER,"He is your husband, no?"
233479,L430969,u6940,m464,FAITH,It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
233480,L430968,u6935,m464,CLERK,You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
233481,L430083,u6935,m464,CLERK,"Okay, ma'am, just a moment."
233482,L430082,u6940,m464,FAITH,You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
233483,L430081,u6935,m464,CLERK,"Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane."
233484,L430079,u6935,m464,CLERK,"I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane."
233485,L430078,u6940,m464,FAITH,I-- I must've misplaced it.
233486,L430077,u6935,m464,CLERK,"May I see your boarding pass, please?"
233487,L430233,u6940,m464,FAITH,So.  How do we get to Rome?
233488,L430232,u6936,m464,CONCIERGE,He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
233489,L430218,u6940,m464,FAITH,Because.
233490,L430217,u6936,m464,CONCIERGE,Why?
233491,L430216,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?"
233492,L430172,u6936,m464,CONCIERGE,"Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them."
233493,L430171,u6940,m464,FAITH,Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
233494,L430167,u6936,m464,CONCIERGE,I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
233495,L430166,u6940,m464,FAITH,He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
233496,L430165,u6936,m464,CONCIERGE,Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
233497,L430164,u6940,m464,FAITH,Excuse me?
233498,L430159,u6936,m464,CONCIERGE,Buona notte.
233499,L430158,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You ask what room he's in, okay?"
233500,L430398,u6937,m464,DAMON,Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
233501,L430397,u6944,m464,KATE,No.
233502,L430396,u6937,m464,DAMON,Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
233503,L430395,u6944,m464,KATE,No.
233504,L430394,u6937,m464,DAMON,Were they pen pals?
233505,L430391,u6937,m464,DAMON,Seriously.
233506,L430390,u6944,m464,KATE,Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
233507,L430389,u6937,m464,DAMON,"No, really.  What's she doing?"
233508,L430388,u6944,m464,KATE,So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
233509,L430387,u6937,m464,DAMON,What for?
233510,L430386,u6944,m464,KATE,She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
233511,L430385,u6937,m464,DAMON,What's she doing?
233512,L430384,u6944,m464,KATE,My friend has lost her fucking mind...
233513,L430383,u6937,m464,DAMON,"So, what's the story with your friend?"
233514,L430474,u6940,m464,FAITH,What is it?
233515,L430473,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
233516,L430472,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233517,L430470,u6940,m464,FAITH,It's alright...  this is our destiny.
233518,L430469,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,Yes.  We did.
233519,L430468,u6940,m464,FAITH,"We found each other, didn't we?"
233520,L430467,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,You're sure...
233521,L430466,u6940,m464,FAITH,Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
233522,L430464,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,"Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too."
233523,L430463,u6940,m464,FAITH,Let's find a telephone.
233524,L430462,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,Good.
233525,L430461,u6940,m464,FAITH,I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
233526,L430460,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,You're sure...
233527,L430459,u6940,m464,FAITH,It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
233528,L430458,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,"Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?"
233529,L430450,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis."
233530,L430449,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,What?...
233531,L430424,u6940,m464,FAITH,Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
233532,L430423,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,"But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves."
233533,L430419,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,Your hair... is perfect.
233534,L430418,u6940,m464,FAITH,"My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?"
233535,L430417,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,Yes.
233536,L430416,u6940,m464,FAITH,"--separate, in the evening..."""
233537,L430415,u6938,m464,DAMON'S MOTHER,"There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, ""Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--"
233538,L430270,u6945,m464,LARRY,What great aunt?
233539,L430269,u6939,m464,DWAYNE,Your great aunt.
233540,L430268,u6945,m464,LARRY,Who's dying?
233541,L430267,u6945,m464,LARRY,Exactly.
233542,L430266,u6939,m464,DWAYNE,Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
233543,L430265,u6945,m464,LARRY,"She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about ""communication"".  Like I don't know how to communicate."
233544,L430264,u6939,m464,DWAYNE,"I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?"
233545,L430457,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport."
233546,L430456,u6941,m464,FRANCESCA,Dwayne?
233547,L430455,u6940,m464,FAITH,"And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne."
233548,L430454,u6941,m464,FRANCESCA,Except possibly that.
233549,L430453,u6940,m464,FAITH,I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
233550,L430452,u6941,m464,FRANCESCA,Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
233551,L430451,u6940,m464,FAITH,There is one other thing you should know about me.
233552,L430429,u6940,m464,FAITH,My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
233553,L430428,u6941,m464,FRANCESCA,No...
233554,L430427,u6940,m464,FAITH,I'm a liberal!
233555,L430422,u6940,m464,FAITH,No.
233556,L430421,u6941,m464,FRANCESCA,Oh no.  Do you?
233557,L430420,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?"
233558,L430321,u6940,m464,FAITH,"That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you."
233559,L430320,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
233560,L430319,u6940,m464,FAITH,What's mezzaluna?
233561,L430318,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,...has a prior commitment.
233562,L430313,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,Ha un numero di telefono?
233563,L430312,u6940,m464,FAITH,Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
233564,L430311,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,No.
233565,L430310,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,Sa dov'e' lui?
233566,L430309,u6940,m464,FAITH,Ask her if she knows where he is?
233567,L430308,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,A very large pig.
233568,L430952,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?...
233569,L430951,u6945,m464,LARRY,But Faith--
233570,L430950,u6940,m464,FAITH,I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
233571,L430949,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Please, Larry.  I have to hurry."
233572,L430948,u6945,m464,LARRY,"But, Faith--"
233573,L430947,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him."
233574,L430946,u6945,m464,LARRY,"Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--"
233575,L430945,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Larry, can I borrow your car keys?"
233576,L430935,u6945,m464,LARRY,No.
233577,L430934,u6940,m464,FAITH,Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
233578,L429874,u6945,m464,LARRY,Okaaaaayyyy.
233579,L429873,u6940,m464,FAITH,We'll KNOW.
233580,L429871,u6940,m464,FAITH,"If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell."
233581,L429870,u6945,m464,LARRY,"Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?"
233582,L429869,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive."
233583,L429868,u6945,m464,LARRY,"Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?"
233584,L429864,u6940,m464,FAITH,Wait.  I have to write this down.
233585,L429863,u6945,m464,LARRY,I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
233586,L430920,u6946,m464,LEONARD,"Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks."
233587,L430919,u6940,m464,FAITH,Hm.
233588,L430918,u6946,m464,LEONARD,"Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?"
233589,L430917,u6940,m464,FAITH,Non.  Please.
233590,L430916,u6946,m464,LEONARD,Smoking or non-smoking?
233591,L430915,u6940,m464,FAITH,Amazing.
233592,L430914,u6946,m464,LEONARD,"It's an amazing place, don't you think?"
233593,L430910,u6946,m464,LEONARD,I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
233594,L430909,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?"
233595,L430908,u6946,m464,LEONARD,Thanks.
233596,L430907,u6940,m464,FAITH,Congratulations.
233597,L430906,u6946,m464,LEONARD,My picture's up?
233598,L430905,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse."
233599,L430904,u6946,m464,LEONARD,"It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much."
233600,L430903,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it."
233601,L430902,u6946,m464,LEONARD,Hi there...
233602,L430901,u6940,m464,FAITH,You...
233603,L430068,u6948,m464,PHONE,"Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together."
233604,L430067,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?..."
233605,L430066,u6948,m464,PHONE,I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
233606,L430065,u6940,m464,FAITH,Where are you going?
233607,L430064,u6948,m464,PHONE,"Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock."
233608,L430063,u6940,m464,FAITH,Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
233609,L430062,u6948,m464,PHONE,I'm at the airport.  Why?
233610,L430061,u6940,m464,FAITH,WAIT!!  Where are you?
233611,L430060,u6948,m464,PHONE,Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
233612,L430059,u6940,m464,FAITH,Damon Bradley...
233613,L430058,u6940,m464,FAITH,I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
233614,L430057,u6948,m464,PHONE,My name's
233615,L430056,u6940,m464,FAITH,I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
233616,L430055,u6948,m464,PHONE,"Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it."
233617,L430054,u6940,m464,FAITH,This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
233618,L430053,u6948,m464,PHONE,Who's this?
233619,L430052,u6940,m464,FAITH,He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
233620,L430051,u6948,m464,PHONE,Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
233621,L430050,u6940,m464,FAITH,Hello?  Is anybody there?
233622,L430982,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I brought you that, too."
233623,L430981,u6947,m464,PETER,I was hoping for the real thing.
233624,L430896,u6940,m464,FAITH,There is no us.
233625,L430895,u6947,m464,PETER,"Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us..."
233626,L430894,u6947,m464,PETER,"If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home."
233627,L430893,u6940,m464,FAITH,That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
233628,L430892,u6947,m464,PETER,And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
233629,L430891,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yes.
233630,L430890,u6947,m464,PETER,Really?...
233631,L430889,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you."
233632,L430888,u6947,m464,PETER,Very funny.
233633,L430887,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead."
233634,L430886,u6947,m464,PETER,"Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?"
233635,L430885,u6940,m464,FAITH,Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
233636,L430884,u6947,m464,PETER,"Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational."
233637,L430883,u6940,m464,FAITH,I would call it-- unforgivable.
233638,L430882,u6947,m464,PETER,What would you call it?
233639,L430881,u6940,m464,FAITH,"A ""little white lie""?  A ""little white lie""?"
233640,L430880,u6947,m464,PETER,"As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie."
233641,L430879,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you."
233642,L430878,u6947,m464,PETER,"I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?"
233643,L430877,u6940,m464,FAITH,You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
233644,L430876,u6947,m464,PETER,"And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it."
233645,L430875,u6940,m464,FAITH,I can't believe you did that!
233646,L430874,u6947,m464,PETER,Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
233647,L430872,u6940,m464,FAITH,No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
233648,L430871,u6947,m464,PETER,I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
233649,L430870,u6940,m464,FAITH,Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
233650,L430869,u6947,m464,PETER,Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
233651,L430868,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233652,L430867,u6947,m464,PETER,There's no such thing.
233653,L430866,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--"
233654,L430865,u6947,m464,PETER,I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
233655,L430864,u6940,m464,FAITH,GET OUT!!
233656,L430863,u6947,m464,PETER,Is something the matter?
233657,L430861,u6947,m464,PETER,Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
233658,L430860,u6940,m464,FAITH,I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
233659,L430859,u6947,m464,PETER,You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
233660,L430855,u6947,m464,PETER,In that case... no...
233661,L430854,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yes.  I am.
233662,L430853,u6947,m464,PETER,Are you asking me out?
233663,L430852,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans."
233664,L430851,u6947,m464,PETER,Well.  Congratulations.
233665,L430850,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual."
233666,L430849,u6947,m464,PETER,You aren't?
233667,L430848,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married."
233668,L430847,u6947,m464,PETER,I know the feeling.
233669,L430846,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something."
233670,L430845,u6940,m464,FAITH,No.  I just came by to apologize.
233671,L430844,u6947,m464,PETER,No.  Are you're leaving?
233672,L430843,u6940,m464,FAITH,Hi.  Are you... busy?
233673,L430842,u6947,m464,PETER,Hi.
233674,L430814,u6940,m464,FAITH,No.  Course not.
233675,L430813,u6947,m464,PETER,Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
233676,L430810,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind."
233677,L430809,u6947,m464,PETER,"Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do."
233678,L430806,u6940,m464,FAITH,I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
233679,L430805,u6947,m464,PETER,I'm sorry.
233680,L430804,u6947,m464,PETER,"I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?"
233681,L430803,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yeah.
233682,L430802,u6947,m464,PETER,You okay?
233683,L430782,u6947,m464,PETER,"Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn."
233684,L430781,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn."
233685,L430780,u6947,m464,PETER,The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
233686,L430779,u6940,m464,FAITH,How about music?  You like classical?
233687,L430777,u6947,m464,PETER,The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
233688,L430776,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway."
233689,L430756,u6947,m464,PETER,"Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double."
233690,L430755,u6940,m464,FAITH,So were you.
233691,L430754,u6947,m464,PETER,"I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?"
233692,L430753,u6940,m464,FAITH,Why are you doing this?
233693,L430751,u6940,m464,FAITH,I don't know if that's such a--
233694,L430750,u6947,m464,PETER,"Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?"
233695,L430743,u6947,m464,PETER,"Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?"
233696,L430742,u6940,m464,FAITH,You were saying...
233697,L430728,u6947,m464,PETER,We were hungry.
233698,L430727,u6940,m464,FAITH,What are you doing here?
233699,L430726,u6947,m464,PETER,What?...
233700,L430707,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much."
233701,L430706,u6947,m464,PETER,Nice dress.
233702,L430705,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233703,L430704,u6947,m464,PETER,Hey--
233704,L430703,u6940,m464,FAITH,You too.
233705,L430702,u6947,m464,PETER,"Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time."
233706,L430701,u6940,m464,FAITH,Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
233707,L430700,u6947,m464,PETER,Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
233708,L430698,u6947,m464,PETER,"Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?"
233709,L430697,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, good.  Good for you."
233710,L430696,u6947,m464,PETER,"And she's a knock-out, too."
233711,L430695,u6947,m464,PETER,Yeah.
233712,L430694,u6940,m464,FAITH,Oh.  That's nice.
233713,L430693,u6947,m464,PETER,"Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to."
233714,L430692,u6940,m464,FAITH,You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
233715,L430691,u6947,m464,PETER,So.  You found him.
233716,L430689,u6947,m464,PETER,Hi.
233717,L430688,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Hi, Peter."
233718,L430632,u6940,m464,FAITH,NO.
233719,L430631,u6947,m464,PETER,Do you want me to do it?
233720,L430626,u6947,m464,PETER,"Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother."
233721,L430625,u6940,m464,FAITH,Right now?
233722,L430624,u6947,m464,PETER,He's out by the pool right now.
233723,L430620,u6947,m464,PETER,Or Hustler.
233724,L430619,u6940,m464,FAITH,Mickey Spillane?
233725,L430618,u6947,m464,PETER,Mickey Spillane.
233726,L430617,u6940,m464,FAITH,Please.  I need to know.
233727,L430616,u6947,m464,PETER,I'd really rather not say.
233728,L430615,u6940,m464,FAITH,Tell me.
233729,L430614,u6947,m464,PETER,"Uh, I'd rather not say."
233730,L430613,u6940,m464,FAITH,He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
233731,L430612,u6947,m464,PETER,"The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him."
233732,L430605,u6947,m464,PETER,Because-- I want you to be happy.
233733,L430604,u6940,m464,FAITH,Why?
233734,L430603,u6947,m464,PETER,"Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you."
233735,L430602,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea."
233736,L430601,u6947,m464,PETER,It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
233737,L430600,u6940,m464,FAITH,Where's Positano?
233738,L430599,u6947,m464,PETER,"I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in."
233739,L430598,u6947,m464,PETER,Because.  I know where he is.
233740,L430597,u6940,m464,FAITH,Why not?
233741,L430594,u6940,m464,FAITH,Who says I don't love him?...
233742,L430593,u6947,m464,PETER,Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
233743,L430591,u6947,m464,PETER,Because I don't have the right name?!
233744,L430590,u6940,m464,FAITH,Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
233745,L430589,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage."
233746,L430588,u6947,m464,PETER,What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
233747,L430587,u6940,m464,FAITH,So it wasn't real.
233748,L430586,u6947,m464,PETER,So?
233749,L430585,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie."
233750,L430584,u6947,m464,PETER,"There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me."
233751,L430583,u6947,m464,PETER,He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
233752,L430582,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233753,L430581,u6947,m464,PETER,"You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?"
233754,L430580,u6947,m464,PETER,Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
233755,L430579,u6940,m464,FAITH,Why are you asking me this?
233756,L430578,u6947,m464,PETER,You didn't answer my question.
233757,L430577,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He wants to marry me, doesn't he?"
233758,L430576,u6947,m464,PETER,Does he love you?
233759,L430575,u6940,m464,FAITH,So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
233760,L430574,u6947,m464,PETER,He's safe.
233761,L430573,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me."
233762,L430571,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yes.
233763,L430570,u6947,m464,PETER,To the foot doctor.
233764,L430569,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yes.
233765,L430568,u6947,m464,PETER,"Yes?!  To be married, I suppose."
233766,L430567,u6940,m464,FAITH,"If it's any of your business, yes."
233767,L430566,u6947,m464,PETER,Why can't you just tell me?
233768,L430565,u6947,m464,PETER,"You are leaving, aren't you?"
233769,L430564,u6940,m464,FAITH,NO.
233770,L430563,u6947,m464,PETER,Are you okay?  You want some help?
233771,L430562,u6940,m464,FAITH,I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
233772,L430561,u6947,m464,PETER,You're limping.
233773,L430489,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?"
233774,L430488,u6947,m464,PETER,I'm in love with you.
233775,L430487,u6940,m464,FAITH,How could you do this to me?
233776,L430483,u6940,m464,FAITH,That was before I found out what it was.
233777,L430482,u6947,m464,PETER,You said whatever it was you would understand.
233778,L430481,u6940,m464,FAITH,That's not the point.
233779,L430791,u6943,m464,HIM,Let's face it.  You want me.
233780,L430790,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233781,L430789,u6943,m464,HIM,"So, what are we waiting for?"
233782,L430739,u6943,m464,HIM,A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
233783,L430738,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, you say you've been to Italy before?"
233784,L430735,u6943,m464,HIM,"Mommy, this is Faith."
233785,L430734,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, hello."
233786,L430733,u6943,m464,HIM,"Faith, this is my mother."
233787,L430730,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too."
233788,L430729,u6943,m464,HIM,So what do you think?
233789,L430725,u6940,m464,FAITH,You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
233790,L430724,u6943,m464,HIM,"Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good..."
233791,L430723,u6940,m464,FAITH,What looks good?
233792,L430722,u6940,m464,FAITH,Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
233793,L430721,u6943,m464,HIM,"Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?"
233794,L430720,u6940,m464,FAITH,Excuse me?
233795,L430716,u6943,m464,HIM,And more...
233796,L430715,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, to-- new friends."
233797,L430714,u6943,m464,HIM,Really...
233798,L430713,u6940,m464,FAITH,Really?
233799,L430712,u6943,m464,HIM,"You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us."
233800,L430711,u6943,m464,HIM,"Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please."
233801,L430710,u6940,m464,FAITH,Sure.
233802,L430681,u6943,m464,HIM,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith."
233803,L430680,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith."
233804,L430679,u6943,m464,HIM,Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
233805,L430678,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yes?
233806,L430677,u6943,m464,HIM,Wait.
233807,L430676,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Okay.  Good.  See you then, then."
233808,L430675,u6943,m464,HIM,I'll look forward to it.
233809,L430673,u6940,m464,FAITH,You would?  Really?
233810,L430672,u6943,m464,HIM,Sure.
233811,L430671,u6940,m464,FAITH,Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
233812,L430670,u6943,m464,HIM,"Well, not exactly..."
233813,L430669,u6940,m464,FAITH,Any night.
233814,L430668,u6943,m464,HIM,Tonight?
233815,L430667,u6940,m464,FAITH,I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
233816,L430664,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single."
233817,L430663,u6943,m464,HIM,Just since yesterday.
233818,L430662,u6940,m464,FAITH,Been here long?
233819,L430661,u6943,m464,HIM,Sure is.
233820,L430660,u6940,m464,FAITH,Beautiful place...
233821,L430659,u6943,m464,HIM,Hello.
233822,L430647,u6943,m464,HIM,Uh huh.
233823,L430646,u6940,m464,FAITH,You're Damon Bradley?
233824,L430941,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Larry, did you rent a car?"
233825,L430940,u6944,m464,KATE,He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
233826,L430939,u6940,m464,FAITH,I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
233827,L430840,u6940,m464,FAITH,I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
233828,L430839,u6944,m464,KATE,What about Larry?
233829,L430838,u6940,m464,FAITH,And Larry?...
233830,L430837,u6944,m464,KATE,Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
233831,L430836,u6944,m464,KATE,Oh.
233832,L430835,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding."
233833,L430834,u6944,m464,KATE,"Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?"
233834,L430833,u6940,m464,FAITH,I didn't expect you back so soon.
233835,L430832,u6944,m464,KATE,Uh huh.
233836,L430831,u6940,m464,FAITH,Kate is that you?
233837,L430816,u6940,m464,FAITH,So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
233838,L430815,u6944,m464,KATE,So...
233839,L430797,u6944,m464,KATE,When you could've found one in America.
233840,L430796,u6940,m464,FAITH,I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
233841,L430795,u6944,m464,KATE,Yup.
233842,L430794,u6940,m464,FAITH,I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
233843,L430793,u6944,m464,KATE,Yes.  He is.
233844,L430792,u6940,m464,FAITH,He's a jerk.
233845,L430775,u6944,m464,KATE,Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
233846,L430774,u6940,m464,FAITH,Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
233847,L430773,u6944,m464,KATE,I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
233848,L430772,u6940,m464,FAITH,Maybe I can change him.
233849,L430769,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past."
233850,L430768,u6944,m464,KATE,And he is living proof.
233851,L430767,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No one's perfect, Kate."
233852,L430766,u6944,m464,KATE,"Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says ""nuculear"" and ""irregardless""."
233853,L430762,u6944,m464,KATE,"Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?"
233854,L430761,u6940,m464,FAITH,Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
233855,L430653,u6944,m464,KATE,"Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?"
233856,L430652,u6940,m464,FAITH,My God... you're right.
233857,L430651,u6944,m464,KATE,"It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable."
233858,L430650,u6940,m464,FAITH,What if he doesn't like me?
233859,L430649,u6944,m464,KATE,Whatareyoudoing?!
233860,L430622,u6940,m464,FAITH,Is Damon Bradley here?
233861,L430621,u6944,m464,KATE,Joan Collins stayed here.
233862,L430610,u6940,m464,FAITH,He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
233863,L430609,u6944,m464,KATE,Amazing...
233864,L430608,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
233865,L430607,u6944,m464,KATE,Peter found him?
233866,L430554,u6944,m464,KATE,I'll be back before you leave.
233867,L430553,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend."
233868,L430552,u6944,m464,KATE,You sure you'll be okay?
233869,L430551,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  No, you go ahead."
233870,L430548,u6944,m464,KATE,"I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all."
233871,L430547,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233872,L430546,u6944,m464,KATE,Who said I was going?
233873,L430545,u6940,m464,FAITH,"The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour."
233874,L430544,u6940,m464,FAITH,Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
233875,L430543,u6944,m464,KATE,What about Peter?...
233876,L430542,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened."
233877,L430541,u6944,m464,KATE,...and a fortune teller.
233878,L430540,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It was a ouija board, remember?"
233879,L430539,u6944,m464,KATE,"I know, but..."
233880,L430538,u6940,m464,FAITH,I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
233881,L430537,u6944,m464,KATE,So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
233882,L430536,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know."
233883,L430535,u6944,m464,KATE,"Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up."
233884,L430534,u6940,m464,FAITH,A little bad luck?
233885,L430533,u6944,m464,KATE,"So, you've had a little bad luck."
233886,L430532,u6940,m464,FAITH,Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
233887,L430531,u6944,m464,KATE,Why?
233888,L430530,u6940,m464,FAITH,Packing.
233889,L430529,u6944,m464,KATE,Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
233890,L430528,u6940,m464,FAITH,Hi.  Where've you been?
233891,L430527,u6944,m464,KATE,Hi-iii...
233892,L430492,u6944,m464,KATE,Men have ways.
233893,L430491,u6940,m464,FAITH,But how could he know?  He only just met me.
233894,L430490,u6944,m464,KATE,Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
233895,L430379,u6940,m464,FAITH,Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
233896,L430378,u6944,m464,KATE,No... Like a psychiatrist.
233897,L430377,u6940,m464,FAITH,Like a detective.
233898,L430376,u6944,m464,KATE,I think it's time we got some professional help.
233899,L430375,u6940,m464,FAITH,I meant about my idea.
233900,L430374,u6944,m464,KATE,That was really sweet...
233901,L430368,u6940,m464,FAITH,"And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him."
233902,L430367,u6944,m464,KATE,"And then what, Faith?"
233903,L430366,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--"
233904,L430365,u6944,m464,KATE,"Well, nobody can say we didn't try."
233905,L430363,u6944,m464,KATE,Good luck.
233906,L430362,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233907,L430361,u6944,m464,KATE,Faith--
233908,L430360,u6940,m464,FAITH,Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
233909,L430359,u6944,m464,KATE,"Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales."
233910,L430358,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?"
233911,L430354,u6944,m464,KATE,Nope.
233912,L430353,u6940,m464,FAITH,Is he looking at us?
233913,L430352,u6944,m464,KATE,"He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow."
233914,L430351,u6940,m464,FAITH,Oh my God.  Where?
233915,L430350,u6944,m464,KATE,He's heeeeeerrre...
233916,L430349,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?"
233917,L430348,u6944,m464,KATE,Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
233918,L430347,u6940,m464,FAITH,Sure you did.
233919,L430346,u6944,m464,KATE,I never even got to be single.
233920,L430345,u6940,m464,FAITH,Because I'm the one who's single.
233921,L430344,u6944,m464,KATE,"Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?"
233922,L430343,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals."
233923,L430342,u6944,m464,KATE,So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
233924,L430335,u6944,m464,KATE,You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
233925,L430334,u6940,m464,FAITH,I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
233926,L430331,u6944,m464,KATE,You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
233927,L430330,u6940,m464,FAITH,"All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?"
233928,L430301,u6944,m464,KATE,What's she saying?
233929,L430300,u6940,m464,FAITH,I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
233930,L430299,u6944,m464,KATE,What did you say to her?
233931,L430292,u6940,m464,FAITH,Right.  My brother.
233932,L430291,u6944,m464,KATE,Her brother.
233933,L430290,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--"
233934,L430262,u6944,m464,KATE,Polo.
233935,L430261,u6940,m464,FAITH,Larry bought himself cologne?
233936,L430260,u6944,m464,KATE,He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
233937,L430258,u6940,m464,FAITH,"And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that."
233938,L430257,u6944,m464,KATE,That was a long time ago.
233939,L430254,u6944,m464,KATE,"You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out."
233940,L430253,u6940,m464,FAITH,'Course he does.
233941,L430252,u6944,m464,KATE,You think he misses me at all?
233942,L430251,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him."
233943,L430250,u6944,m464,KATE,"So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?"
233944,L430249,u6940,m464,FAITH,Sorry.
233945,L430248,u6944,m464,KATE,"Well, you don't have to get snippy with me."
233946,L430247,u6940,m464,FAITH,You expecting somebody you know?
233947,L430244,u6940,m464,FAITH,Nothing.
233948,L430243,u6944,m464,KATE,What's that supposed to mean?...
233949,L430242,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story."
233950,L430241,u6944,m464,KATE,I'm hungry.
233951,L430239,u6940,m464,FAITH,Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
233952,L430238,u6944,m464,KATE,"We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile."
233953,L430237,u6940,m464,FAITH,I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
233954,L430235,u6940,m464,FAITH,The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
233955,L430234,u6944,m464,KATE,Couldn't we just have taken a train?
233956,L430227,u6940,m464,FAITH,What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
233957,L430226,u6944,m464,KATE,Your brother?
233958,L430214,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Only, it's in Italian..."
233959,L430213,u6944,m464,KATE,Only what?
233960,L430212,u6940,m464,FAITH,A phone message.  Only--
233961,L430211,u6944,m464,KATE,What is it?
233962,L430210,u6940,m464,FAITH,We're saved!
233963,L430208,u6940,m464,FAITH,Oh.  Right.
233964,L430207,u6944,m464,KATE,"We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him."
233965,L430206,u6940,m464,FAITH,Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
233966,L430205,u6944,m464,KATE,"A rich, possibly fat, slob."
233967,L430204,u6940,m464,FAITH,A Butterfinger wrapper.
233968,L430203,u6944,m464,KATE,What'd you find?
233969,L430202,u6940,m464,FAITH,Ah ha!...
233970,L430199,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around."
233971,L430198,u6944,m464,KATE,So?
233972,L430197,u6940,m464,FAITH,"The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?"
233973,L430196,u6944,m464,KATE,I just got a dial tone--
233974,L430194,u6944,m464,KATE,I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
233975,L430193,u6940,m464,FAITH,Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
233976,L430192,u6944,m464,KATE,You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
233977,L430187,u6940,m464,FAITH,He fell out.
233978,L430186,u6944,m464,KATE,What are you doing?
233979,L430183,u6944,m464,KATE,"Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good."
233980,L430182,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for."
233981,L430181,u6944,m464,KATE,You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
233982,L430180,u6940,m464,FAITH,I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
233983,L430178,u6940,m464,FAITH,We lost him?...
233984,L430177,u6944,m464,KATE,You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
233985,L430176,u6940,m464,FAITH,I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
233986,L430153,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else."
233987,L430152,u6944,m464,KATE,Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
233988,L430151,u6940,m464,FAITH,Are you sure?
233989,L430150,u6944,m464,KATE,"""Of the Rich and Famous"".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this."
233990,L430149,u6940,m464,FAITH,What?
233991,L430148,u6944,m464,KATE,This is a Lifestyles hotel.
233992,L430142,u6940,m464,FAITH,I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
233993,L430141,u6944,m464,KATE,"""Gritty""?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?"
233994,L430140,u6940,m464,FAITH,It's called... the Gritty Palace.
233995,L430139,u6944,m464,KATE,The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
233996,L430138,u6940,m464,FAITH,Now what do we do?
233997,L430132,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?"
233998,L430131,u6944,m464,KATE,You okay?
233999,L430127,u6940,m464,FAITH,You're coming with me?
234000,L430126,u6944,m464,KATE,I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
234001,L430122,u6940,m464,FAITH,Maybe.
234002,L430121,u6944,m464,KATE,Live happily ever after.
234003,L430120,u6940,m464,FAITH,"How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--"
234004,L430119,u6944,m464,KATE,A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
234005,L430117,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying."
234006,L430116,u6944,m464,KATE,You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
234007,L430115,u6940,m464,FAITH,Thank you so much.
234008,L430114,u6944,m464,KATE,"My God, you have..."
234009,L430113,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller."
234010,L430110,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person."
234011,L430109,u6944,m464,KATE,I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
234012,L430102,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either."
234013,L430101,u6944,m464,KATE,Does Dwayne know about this?
234014,L430100,u6940,m464,FAITH,Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
234015,L430099,u6944,m464,KATE,Because you were afraid to fly.
234016,L430098,u6940,m464,FAITH,That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
234017,L430097,u6944,m464,KATE,You don't have a passport.
234018,L430096,u6940,m464,FAITH,I have vacation time coming to me.
234019,L430095,u6944,m464,KATE,What about your job?
234020,L430094,u6940,m464,FAITH,It's still the new year...
234021,L430093,u6944,m464,KATE,But it's July.
234022,L430092,u6940,m464,FAITH,It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
234023,L430072,u6940,m464,FAITH,The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
234024,L430071,u6944,m464,KATE,It's a coincidence.
234025,L430070,u6940,m464,FAITH,It's a miracle.
234026,L430047,u6940,m464,FAITH,"After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--"
234027,L430046,u6944,m464,KATE,No...  I can just tell.
234028,L430045,u6940,m464,FAITH,Have you seen him with someone?
234029,L430043,u6944,m464,KATE,I think he's having an affair.
234030,L430042,u6940,m464,FAITH,Is that bad?...
234031,L430041,u6944,m464,KATE,Larry brought me flowers last night.
234032,L430040,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Kate, is something the matter?"
234033,L430039,u6944,m464,KATE,"I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody."
234034,L430038,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?"
234035,L430037,u6944,m464,KATE,"People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life."
234036,L430036,u6940,m464,FAITH,I know.  You're right.
234037,L430035,u6944,m464,KATE,"Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work."
234038,L430034,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
234039,L430033,u6944,m464,KATE,But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
234040,L430032,u6944,m464,KATE,"That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn."
234041,L430031,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies."
234042,L430030,u6944,m464,KATE,But what?
234043,L430029,u6940,m464,FAITH,I know...  It was.
234044,L430028,u6944,m464,KATE,I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
234045,L430027,u6940,m464,FAITH,Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
234046,L430026,u6944,m464,KATE,"Come on, it's not so bad."
234047,L430015,u6944,m464,KATE,"Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love."
234048,L430014,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yes you did.
234049,L430013,u6944,m464,KATE,He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
234050,L429980,u6944,m464,KATE,"If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?"
234051,L429979,u6940,m464,FAITH,Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
234052,L429978,u6944,m464,KATE,Why don't you ask him?
234053,L429977,u6940,m464,FAITH,No.  He's never asked me.
234054,L429976,u6944,m464,KATE,"""Thrills""?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?"
234055,L429973,u6940,m464,FAITH,He's a podiatrist or something.
234056,L429972,u6944,m464,KATE,You don't have any idea?
234057,L429971,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know, Kate."
234058,L429970,u6944,m464,KATE,What's he do?
234059,L429969,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator."
234060,L429968,u6944,m464,KATE,So?...
234061,L429967,u6940,m464,FAITH,I don't know.  I don't think so.
234062,L429966,u6944,m464,KATE,Is he gay?
234063,L429965,u6940,m464,FAITH,No.
234064,L429964,u6944,m464,KATE,Is he married?
234065,L429963,u6940,m464,FAITH,No.
234066,L429956,u6944,m464,KATE,"Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up."
234067,L429955,u6940,m464,FAITH,I wish you didn't have to go so early.
234068,L429954,u6944,m464,KATE,"No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination."
234069,L429953,u6940,m464,FAITH,Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
234070,L429952,u6944,m464,KATE,"So, what's your point?"
234071,L429951,u6940,m464,FAITH,But somebody wrote those songs.
234072,L429950,u6944,m464,KATE,Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
234073,L429949,u6940,m464,FAITH,Is everything okay?
234074,L429942,u6944,m464,KATE,"I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime."
234075,L429941,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer."
234076,L429940,u6944,m464,KATE,It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
234077,L429939,u6940,m464,FAITH,I don't have an Amana freezer.
234078,L429937,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--"
234079,L429936,u6944,m464,KATE,"So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome."
234080,L429935,u6944,m464,KATE,Oh.
234081,L429934,u6940,m464,FAITH,Scientologist.
234082,L429933,u6944,m464,KATE,How about that guy at the bank?
234083,L429932,u6940,m464,FAITH,Just moved in with his girlfriend.
234084,L429931,u6944,m464,KATE,How about the other one?  His friend.
234085,L429930,u6940,m464,FAITH,No.  He smokes.
234086,L429929,u6944,m464,KATE,"What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?"
234087,L429928,u6944,m464,KATE,You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
234088,L429927,u6940,m464,FAITH,I don't believe in statistics.
234089,L429892,u6940,m464,FAITH,Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
234090,L429891,u6944,m464,KATE,"I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?"
234091,L430825,u6944,m464,KATE,That's exactly what you are.
234092,L430824,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,Huh?
234093,L430823,u6944,m464,KATE,Giovanni.
234094,L430822,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
234095,L430821,u6944,m464,KATE,But I do want to.
234096,L430820,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,You don't have to go if you don't want to...
234097,L430819,u6944,m464,KATE,"No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to."
234098,L430818,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,I thank you.
234099,L430817,u6944,m464,KATE,"Giovanni, I want to thank you."
234100,L430526,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
234101,L430525,u6944,m464,KATE,How old are you?
234102,L430524,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,"You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure..."
234103,L430523,u6944,m464,KATE,Oh.
234104,L430522,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,It's siesta.
234105,L430517,u6944,m464,KATE,I'd love to.
234106,L430516,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,"Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--"
234107,L430515,u6944,m464,KATE,"Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter."
234108,L430514,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,Oh.
234109,L430307,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
234110,L430306,u6944,m464,KATE,A porco?
234111,L430305,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
234112,L430304,u6944,m464,KATE,My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
234113,L430284,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
234114,L430283,u6944,m464,KATE,"No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later."
234115,L430282,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,"You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?"
234116,L430281,u6944,m464,KATE,Kate.
234117,L430280,u6942,m464,GIOVANNI,And you are?...
234118,L430957,u6945,m464,LARRY,She didn't give me a chance.
234119,L430956,u6944,m464,KATE,And you didn't tell her?
234120,L430955,u6945,m464,LARRY,"She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--"
234121,L430954,u6944,m464,KATE,She what?!
234122,L430943,u6944,m464,KATE,Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
234123,L430942,u6945,m464,LARRY,Yeah--
234124,L430937,u6944,m464,KATE,He missed me.
234125,L430936,u6945,m464,LARRY,I came after the woman I love.
234126,L430932,u6945,m464,LARRY,I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
234127,L430931,u6944,m464,KATE,"Larry, you've got to tell her."
234128,L430930,u6945,m464,LARRY,It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
234129,L430929,u6945,m464,LARRY,I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
234130,L430927,u6944,m464,KATE,Went to high school with him. But...
234131,L430926,u6945,m464,LARRY,He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
234132,L430925,u6944,m464,KATE,Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
234133,L430924,u6945,m464,LARRY,It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
234134,L430923,u6944,m464,KATE,What?  You know him?
234135,L430922,u6945,m464,LARRY,Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
234136,L430009,u6944,m464,KATE,You said it differently then.
234137,L430008,u6945,m464,LARRY,You used to love it when I called you doll.
234138,L430007,u6944,m464,KATE,"Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll."
234139,L430006,u6945,m464,LARRY,"We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?"
234140,L430005,u6944,m464,KATE,"Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money."
234141,L430004,u6945,m464,LARRY,It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
234142,L430003,u6944,m464,KATE,"Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation."
234143,L429999,u6944,m464,KATE,No.
234144,L429998,u6945,m464,LARRY,And we didn't have to bring another present?
234145,L429997,u6944,m464,KATE,Right.
234146,L429996,u6945,m464,LARRY,"This is the last one before the wedding, right?"
234147,L429948,u6945,m464,LARRY,"Well, there's nothing here to eat."
234148,L429947,u6944,m464,KATE,"No, why?"
234149,L429946,u6945,m464,LARRY,"Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?"
234150,L429945,u6944,m464,KATE,You miss me?...
234151,L429944,u6945,m464,LARRY,"Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now."
234152,L430687,u6944,m464,KATE,Sorry...
234153,L430686,u6947,m464,PETER,Thanks.
234154,L430685,u6944,m464,KATE,"Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter."
234155,L430629,u6947,m464,PETER,Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
234156,L430628,u6944,m464,KATE,That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
234157,L430512,u6944,m464,KATE,Ten billion to one.
234158,L430511,u6947,m464,PETER,"I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?"
234159,L430508,u6944,m464,KATE,That's really romantic.
234160,L430507,u6947,m464,PETER,"And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is."
234161,L430506,u6947,m464,PETER,"Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start."
234162,L430505,u6944,m464,KATE,Mania.
234163,L430504,u6947,m464,PETER,"And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--"
234164,L430503,u6947,m464,PETER,"Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe."
234165,L430502,u6944,m464,KATE,Good strategy.
234166,L430501,u6947,m464,PETER,"It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again."
234167,L430499,u6947,m464,PETER,"No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??"
234168,L430498,u6944,m464,KATE,"She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?"
234169,L430497,u6947,m464,PETER,Where is she?
234170,L430496,u6944,m464,KATE,She's not here.
234171,L430495,u6947,m464,PETER,I have to talk to her.
234172,L431495,u6949,m465,BARNEY,You know Johnny when he gets mad.
234173,L431494,u6967,m465,TERRY,I'll come over when I'm ready.
234174,L431493,u6949,m465,BARNEY,"I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home."
234175,L431492,u6967,m465,TERRY,I'm gonna take her home first.
234176,L431491,u6949,m465,BARNEY,"He just got a call from ""Mr. Upstairs."" Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot."
234177,L431490,u6967,m465,TERRY,Right now?
234178,L431563,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, ""Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open,"" so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!"
234179,L431562,u6950,m465,BIG MAC,And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
234180,L431561,u6964,m465,NOLAN,If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
234181,L431560,u6950,m465,BIG MAC,If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
234182,L431559,u6964,m465,NOLAN,Talk louder. I can't hear you.
234183,L431558,u6950,m465,BIG MAC,And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
234184,L431880,u6952,m465,COUNSEL,That's all. Next witness!
234185,L431879,u6950,m465,BIG MAC,"What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you."
234186,L431878,u6952,m465,COUNSEL,Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
234187,L431877,u6950,m465,BIG MAC,We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
234188,L431876,u6952,m465,COUNSEL,"Well, where are they?"
234189,L431875,u6950,m465,BIG MAC,Sure we keep records!
234190,L431874,u6952,m465,COUNSEL,"You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?"
234191,L431704,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?"
234192,L431703,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,But my own kid bro
234193,L431702,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,Then don't.
234194,L431701,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny."
234195,L431700,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here."
234196,L431699,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid."
234197,L431698,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him."
234198,L431697,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"What do you want me to do, Johnny?"
234199,L431696,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"So do I, Charley. For your sake."
234200,L431695,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,I wish I knew.
234201,L431694,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?"
234202,L431693,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
234203,L431690,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,He was always a good kid. You know that.
234204,L431689,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?"
234205,L431688,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
234206,L431687,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry."
234207,L431686,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,I'm not thirsty.
234208,L431685,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you."
234209,L431112,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,Why should he forget it?
234210,L431111,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it."
234211,L431104,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,Gimme.
234212,L431103,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins."
234213,L431100,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?"
234214,L431099,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,It'll do.
234215,L431098,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?"
234216,L431097,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
234217,L431096,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut."
234218,L431095,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
234219,L431092,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'."
234220,L431091,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
234221,L431090,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself."
234222,L431759,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in."
234223,L431758,u6967,m465,TERRY,"It was you, Charley... ."
234224,L431757,u6967,m465,TERRY,"You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley."
234225,L431756,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
234226,L431755,u6967,m465,TERRY,See! You don't understand!
234227,L431754,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
234228,L431753,u6967,m465,TERRY,"It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, ""Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson."" It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money."
234229,L431752,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast."
234230,L431751,u6967,m465,TERRY,"...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?"
234231,L431750,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"What do you weigh these days, slugger?"
234232,L431749,u6967,m465,TERRY,Wow... .
234233,L431748,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry."
234234,L431747,u6967,m465,TERRY,Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
234235,L431746,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you."
234236,L431744,u6967,m465,TERRY,Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
234237,L431743,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... ."
234238,L431742,u6967,m465,TERRY,"I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!"
234239,L431741,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"The point is there isn't much time, kid."
234240,L431740,u6967,m465,TERRY,I could have been better!
234241,L431739,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,What the hell!!!
234242,L431738,u6967,m465,TERRY,Don't say that!
234243,L431737,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
234244,L431736,u6967,m465,TERRY,Don't say that!
234245,L431735,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped"
234246,L431734,u6967,m465,TERRY,I know. I know.
234247,L431733,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?"
234248,L431732,u6967,m465,TERRY,I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
234249,L431731,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against
234250,L431730,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley."
234251,L431729,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?"
234252,L431728,u6967,m465,TERRY,And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
234253,L431727,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
234254,L431726,u6967,m465,TERRY,Boss loader!
234255,L431725,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
234256,L431724,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,Maybe.
234257,L431723,u6967,m465,TERRY,I always figured I'd live longer without it.
234258,L431722,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition."
234259,L431721,u6967,m465,TERRY,"A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted."
234260,L431720,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks."
234261,L431719,u6967,m465,TERRY,Mmhmmm.
234262,L431718,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future."
234263,L431717,u6967,m465,TERRY,Mmhmm.
234264,L431716,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater."
234265,L431715,u6967,m465,TERRY,That's right... .
234266,L431714,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
234267,L431713,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley."
234268,L431712,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk."
234269,L431711,u6967,m465,TERRY,River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
234270,L431708,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,Thicker than water.
234271,L431707,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's"
234272,L431539,u6967,m465,TERRY,Nolan? I knew he had guts but
234273,L431538,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
234274,L431258,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation."
234275,L431257,u6967,m465,TERRY,"But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me."
234276,L431256,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while."
234277,L431255,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there."
234278,L431254,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated."
234279,L431253,u6967,m465,TERRY,I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
234280,L431252,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
234281,L431251,u6967,m465,TERRY,It's a living.
234282,L431250,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,Working hard?
234283,L431026,u6967,m465,TERRY,In a minute.
234284,L431025,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,"Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink."
234285,L431017,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,He probably gave 'em an argument.
234286,L431016,u6967,m465,TERRY,I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
234287,L431015,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,Maybe he gave them an argument.
234288,L431014,u6967,m465,TERRY,I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
234289,L431013,u6951,m465,CHARLEY,That was the idea.
234290,L431012,u6967,m465,TERRY,You said they was only going to talk to him.
234291,L431982,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk."
234292,L431981,u6953,m465,EDIE,They're waiting for him to walk in.
234293,L431970,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Terry... Terry... .
234294,L431969,u6953,m465,EDIE,Terry...?
234295,L431964,u6953,m465,EDIE,"Tommy, what happened?"
234296,L431963,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,What happened?  What happened?
234297,L431189,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
234298,L431188,u6953,m465,EDIE,I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
234299,L431187,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"Hello, Edie."
234300,L431186,u6953,m465,EDIE,Father Barry.
234301,L431052,u6953,m465,EDIE,"""In the church when you need me."" Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?"
234302,L431051,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me."
234303,L431050,u6953,m465,EDIE,"Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father."
234304,L431049,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"I wish I knew, Edie, But"
234305,L431048,u6953,m465,EDIE,"How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?"
234306,L431047,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"Why Edie, I"

With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before."

234342,L431782,u6953,m465,EDIE,Get away from me.
234343,L431781,u6967,m465,TERRY,Edie...
234344,L431780,u6953,m465,EDIE,It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.

234353,L431771,u6953,m465,EDIE,How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
234354,L431770,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you."

234386,L431518,u6953,m465,EDIE,Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.

234388,L431515,u6953,m465,EDIE,"It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?"

234395,L431499,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned."
234396,L431498,u6953,m465,EDIE,Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
234397,L431497,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you."
234398,L431487,u6953,m465,EDIE,It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
234399,L431486,u6967,m465,TERRY,"I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie."
234400,L431481,u6953,m465,EDIE,I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
234401,L431480,u6967,m465,TERRY,What are you crying for?
234402,L431478,u6967,m465,TERRY,For not being any help?

234409,L431471,u6967,m465,TERRY,"I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says"
234410,L431469,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music."
234411,L431468,u6953,m465,EDIE,Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
234412,L431466,u6953,m465,EDIE,But that's living like an animal

234414,L431464,u6953,m465,EDIE,And if you don't?
234415,L431463,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket."
234416,L431462,u6953,m465,EDIE,"You don't believe in anything, do you?"
234417,L431461,u6953,m465,EDIE,But a priest...?

234421,L431457,u6953,m465,EDIE,He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
234422,L431456,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me."
234423,L431455,u6953,m465,EDIE,"Why, Terry, who said it was?"
234424,L431454,u6967,m465,TERRY,Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .

234426,L431452,u6967,m465,TERRY,"What do they do for you, except get in your way?"

234479,L431351,u6967,m465,TERRY,I only live up there and across the roof.
234480,L431350,u6953,m465,EDIE,I'd better go in.
234481,L431349,u6967,m465,TERRY,"That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you."
234482,L431348,u6953,m465,EDIE,Do you like pigeons?
234483,L431347,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?"
234484,L431346,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home."
234485,L431345,u6953,m465,EDIE,When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
234486,L431344,u6967,m465,TERRY,What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
234487,L431343,u6953,m465,EDIE,What?
234488,L431342,u6967,m465,TERRY,Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
234489,L431341,u6953,m465,EDIE,What's that?
234490,L431340,u6953,m465,EDIE,With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
234491,L431339,u6967,m465,TERRY,How would you've done it?
234492,L431338,u6953,m465,EDIE,Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
234493,L431337,u6967,m465,TERRY,Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
234494,L431336,u6953,m465,EDIE,I remember you were in trouble all the time.
234495,L431335,u6967,m465,TERRY,Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
234496,L431334,u6953,m465,EDIE,The moment I saw you.
234497,L431333,u6967,m465,TERRY,The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
234498,L431332,u6953,m465,EDIE,I can get home all right from here
234499,L431331,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Man, you were a mess!"
234500,L431330,u6953,m465,EDIE,I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
234501,L431329,u6967,m465,TERRY,Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
234502,L431328,u6953,m465,EDIE,In braids? That's right.
234503,L431327,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in"
234504,L431326,u6953,m465,EDIE,It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
234505,L431325,u6967,m465,TERRY,A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
234506,L431324,u6953,m465,EDIE,I want to be a teacher.
234507,L431323,u6967,m465,TERRY,"And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?"
234508,L431322,u6953,m465,EDIE,It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
234509,L431321,u6967,m465,TERRY,You training to be a nun or something?
234510,L431320,u6953,m465,EDIE,You know how the Sisters are.
234511,L431318,u6953,m465,EDIE,I better get home.
234512,L431317,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood."
234513,L431316,u6953,m465,EDIE,What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
234514,L431315,u6967,m465,TERRY,Everybody knew him. He got around.
234515,L431314,u6953,m465,EDIE,Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
234516,L431306,u6967,m465,TERRY,I better see you get there.
234517,L431305,u6953,m465,EDIE,I'll get home all right now.
234518,L431304,u6967,m465,TERRY,I'm with Terry.
234519,L431303,u6953,m465,EDIE,Which side are you with?
234520,L431302,u6967,m465,TERRY,They play pretty rough.
234521,L431301,u6953,m465,EDIE,Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
234522,L431300,u6967,m465,TERRY,I think we're O.K.
234523,L431213,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?"
234524,L431212,u6953,m465,EDIE,None of your business.
234525,L431211,u6967,m465,TERRY,What makes him so special?
234526,L431210,u6953,m465,EDIE,Give it to me my Pop's job
234527,L431209,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles."
234528,L431966,u6953,m465,EDIE,Let me by.
234529,L431965,u6965,m465,POP,Where you goin'?
234530,L431381,u6953,m465,EDIE,Pop!
234531,L431380,u6965,m465,POP,You are like
234532,L431379,u6953,m465,EDIE,"Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers."
234533,L431378,u6965,m465,POP,"See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myselfthis is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down."
234534,L431377,u6953,m465,EDIE,"And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion."
234535,L431376,u6965,m465,POP,"You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you."
234536,L431375,u6953,m465,EDIE,He wanted to see me again.
234537,L431374,u6965,m465,POP,Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
234538,L431373,u6953,m465,EDIE,"He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... ."
234539,L431372,u6965,m465,POP,"A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... ."
234540,L431371,u6953,m465,EDIE,"He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... ."
234541,L431370,u6965,m465,POP,I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
234542,L431369,u6953,m465,EDIE,Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
234543,L431368,u6965,m465,POP,"Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat."
234544,L431367,u6953,m465,EDIE,"Who is he, Pop?"
234545,L431366,u6965,m465,POP,"Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?"
234546,L431365,u6953,m465,EDIE,"Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet."
234547,L431364,u6965,m465,POP,You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
234548,L431991,u6967,m465,TERRY,I can? Okay.  Okay...
234549,L431990,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,You can!
234550,L431984,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
234551,L431983,u6967,m465,TERRY,...walk?
234552,L431868,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
234553,L431867,u6967,m465,TERRY,Take your hands off me. What you call me?
234554,L431864,u6967,m465,TERRY,You go to
234555,L431863,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,What did you say?
234556,L431862,u6967,m465,TERRY,You go to hell.
234557,L431861,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Give me that gun.
234558,L431860,u6967,m465,TERRY,Why don't you go and chase yourself?
234559,L431859,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,This is my business.
234560,L431858,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Mind your own business, Father."
234561,L431857,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Your gun.
234562,L431856,u6967,m465,TERRY,"What do you want from me, Father."
234563,L431855,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Now don't give me a hard time.
234564,L431854,u6967,m465,TERRY,You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
234565,L431853,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"I want to see you, Terry."
234566,L431629,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?"
234567,L431628,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Good luck.
234568,L431627,u6967,m465,TERRY,Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
234569,L431626,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking."
234570,L431625,u6967,m465,TERRY,But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
234571,L431624,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,How much is your soul worth if you don't?
234572,L431623,u6967,m465,TERRY,"If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel."
234573,L431622,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,A question of who rides who.
234574,L431621,u6967,m465,TERRY,It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
234575,L431620,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
234576,L431619,u6967,m465,TERRY,About Edie?
234577,L431618,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,What are you going to do?
234578,L431617,u6967,m465,TERRY,"It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved."
234579,L431614,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,I'll find you a priest.
234580,L431613,u6967,m465,TERRY,But you've got to listen to me.
234581,L431612,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
234582,L431611,u6967,m465,TERRY,I don't get it!
234583,L431610,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,I don't want to hear it in there.
234584,L431609,u6967,m465,TERRY,But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
234585,L431608,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Someone else c'n take your confession.
234586,L431607,u6967,m465,TERRY,What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
234587,L431298,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time."
234588,L431297,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,So help me God!
234589,L431296,u6964,m465,NOLAN,Down to the wire?
234590,L431295,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
234591,L431294,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar."
234592,L431293,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me."
234593,L431292,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?"
234594,L431291,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,What do you think?
234595,L431290,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"Are you on the level, Father?"
234596,L431289,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,You still call it ratting?
234597,L431288,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,But you still hold out for silence?
234598,L431287,u6964,m465,NOLAN,Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
234599,L431286,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Nice fellows.
234600,L431285,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!"
234601,L431284,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"You all right, Nolan?"
234602,L431274,u6964,m465,NOLAN,Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
234603,L431273,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,D 'n D?
234604,L431272,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D."
234605,L431271,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,"Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?"
234606,L431264,u6954,m465,FATHER BARRY,Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
234607,L431263,u6964,m465,NOLAN,Who asked him here?
234608,L431683,u6955,m465,GLOVER,Sure... .
234609,L431682,u6967,m465,TERRY,Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
234610,L431681,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Yeah, really!"
234611,L431680,u6955,m465,GLOVER,Really?
234612,L431679,u6967,m465,TERRY,Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
234613,L431678,u6955,m465,GLOVER,"Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?"
234614,L431677,u6955,m465,GLOVER,Yeah?
234615,L431676,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys"
234616,L431675,u6955,m465,GLOVER,I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
234617,L431674,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and"
234618,L431673,u6955,m465,GLOVER,I'm just resting my feet.
234619,L431672,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Listen, this ain't for publication."
234620,L431671,u6955,m465,GLOVER,Such as what?
234621,L431670,u6967,m465,TERRY,Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
234622,L431669,u6955,m465,GLOVER,You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
234623,L431668,u6967,m465,TERRY,"If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night."
234624,L431667,u6955,m465,GLOVER,I think you could have.
234625,L431666,u6967,m465,TERRY,You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
234626,L431665,u6955,m465,GLOVER,I thought you were going to take him that night but...
234627,L431664,u6967,m465,TERRY,Wilson yeah  yeah I fought Wilson.
234628,L431663,u6955,m465,GLOVER,Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
234629,L431662,u6955,m465,GLOVER,"Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?"
234630,L431661,u6967,m465,TERRY,I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
234631,L431660,u6955,m465,GLOVER,Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top oor the folks are usually out.
234632,L431659,u6967,m465,TERRY,You looking for me?
234633,L431510,u6967,m465,TERRY,You know what you're askin'? You're askin'

234730,L431533,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking."
234731,L431532,u6967,m465,TERRY,It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
234732,L431531,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas."
234733,L431530,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Nothing happened, Johnny."
234734,L431529,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
234735,L431528,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Aw, Johnny... ."
234736,L431527,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?"

234747,L431087,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"OK skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?"

234751,L431083,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,"Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try."
234752,L431081,u6961,m465,JOHNNY,It's good for you. Develops your mind.
234753,L431080,u6967,m465,TERRY,"Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny."

234760,L431361,u6962,m465,MRS. COLLINS,She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.

234770,L431307,u6963,m465,MUTT,A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
234771,L430999,u6963,m465,MUTT,"Thanks for nothing, you bum."

234777,L431552,u6965,m465,POP,"Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery."
234778,L431551,u6964,m465,NOLAN,I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
234779,L431550,u6964,m465,NOLAN,"Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you."
234780,L431549,u6965,m465,POP,You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?

234806,L432337,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
234807,L432336,u6968,m466,BOB,All right.  Put it on heavy.
234808,L432335,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
234809,L432334,u6968,m466,BOB,"I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do."
234810,L432333,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,What can we do against them?
234811,L432332,u6968,m466,BOB,I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
234812,L432311,u6968,m466,BOB,...And I thought you loved me.
234813,L432310,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,"Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault."
234814,L432309,u6968,m466,BOB,That sudden?
234815,L432308,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I should hope not.  I hate you!
234816,L432307,u6968,m466,BOB,They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
234817,L432306,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,"Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us."
234818,L432305,u6968,m466,BOB,You're talking nonsense.
234819,L432304,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Yes I feel it in my bones.
234820,L432303,u6968,m466,BOB,You do?
234821,L432302,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,"Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it."
234822,L432301,u6968,m466,BOB,"Hold on just a little longer, Shirley."
234823,L432300,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
234824,L432299,u6968,m466,BOB,"My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway."
234825,L432298,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Nothing is worth your life.
234826,L432297,u6968,m466,BOB,I am--It's our only chance.
234827,L432296,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Be careful!
234828,L432295,u6968,m466,BOB,The ropes are coming loose.
234829,L432237,u6968,m466,BOB,"Whatever you do, don't do that."
234830,L432236,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I'm afraid I'll faint.
234831,L432235,u6968,m466,BOB,"Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time."
234832,L432234,u6968,m466,BOB,I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
234833,L432233,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,What can we do?
234834,L432232,u6968,m466,BOB,Don't let them hear you.
234835,L432231,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Those creatures..!
234836,L432230,u6968,m466,BOB,You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
234837,L432229,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I'm so frightened.
234838,L432207,u6968,m466,BOB,Be careful!--They'll see you.
234839,L432206,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Look!
234840,L432204,u6968,m466,BOB,"I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!"
234841,L432203,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,What do you mean?
234842,L432202,u6968,m466,BOB,I'm not sure...
234843,L432201,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Can't we get out of here?
234844,L432200,u6968,m466,BOB,"It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!"
234845,L432199,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Could it be some kind of college initiation?
234846,L432198,u6968,m466,BOB,"Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon."
234847,L432197,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
234848,L432196,u6968,m466,BOB,Not dead?  In a cemetery?
234849,L432195,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
234850,L432194,u6968,m466,BOB,"All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you."
234851,L432193,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
234852,L432192,u6968,m466,BOB,Something's making that music.
234853,L432191,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
234854,L432190,u6968,m466,BOB,That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
234855,L432189,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Then..then what's that music?
234856,L432188,u6968,m466,BOB,"Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of."
234857,L432187,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,It frightens me.
234858,L432186,u6968,m466,BOB,In there.
234859,L432185,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,Where?
234860,L432184,u6968,m466,BOB,Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
234861,L432171,u6968,m466,BOB,Okay.
234862,L432170,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
234863,L432169,u6968,m466,BOB,There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
234864,L432168,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,"Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back."
234865,L432167,u6968,m466,BOB,"All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots."
234866,L432166,u6968,m466,BOB,Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
234867,L432165,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,That's life.  My kisses are alive.
234868,L432164,u6968,m466,BOB,"Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing."
234869,L432162,u6968,m466,BOB,"Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word."
234870,L432161,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
234871,L432160,u6968,m466,BOB,"Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--"
234872,L432159,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,"But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob."
234873,L432158,u6968,m466,BOB,You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
234874,L432157,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,But does it have to be in a cemetery?
234875,L432156,u6968,m466,BOB,No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
234876,L432155,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
234877,L432376,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now."
234878,L432375,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"Thank you, Master!  Thank you."
234879,L432374,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,You better hope there is.
234880,L432373,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,Is there time?
234881,L432372,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,You may take her now.
234882,L432371,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,You mean...!
234883,L432370,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,Your pleasures of course!
234884,L432369,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,For what!?!
234885,L432368,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,The time...is short.
234886,L432367,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!"
234887,L432366,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>"
234888,L432365,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"Oh, if there is only time!"
234889,L432364,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
234890,L432363,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
234891,L432362,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,Then cancel my order.
234892,L432361,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
234893,L432360,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,I will decide the conclusion.
234894,L432359,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
234895,L432356,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,Well then let us proceed.
234896,L432355,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,There are others.
234897,L432354,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?"
234898,L432353,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"I understand, Master"
234899,L432352,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command."
234900,L432351,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,I would have time for my own pleasures!
234901,L432350,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
234902,L432349,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
234903,L432348,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Ahh, there is yet time."
234904,L432347,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,The moon is almost gone!
234905,L432346,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment."
234906,L432345,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,When!?
234907,L432344,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Ahh, she will be yours."
234908,L432343,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,Well?
234909,L432329,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly..."
234910,L432328,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
234911,L432291,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing."
234912,L432290,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"It would seem so, Master"
234913,L432289,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
234914,L432288,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone."
234915,L432287,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Yes, yes yes I know all that."
234916,L432262,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"As you wish, Master"
234917,L432261,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy."
234918,L432260,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
234919,L432251,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"It would seem so, Master."
234920,L432250,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Oh, yes, a religion of sorts."
234921,L432249,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames."
234922,L432248,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,She was?
234923,L432246,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,Her dance has pleased me.
234924,L432245,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
234925,L432244,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
234926,L432243,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
234927,L432242,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,What kind of symbol?
234928,L432241,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,"A symbol, Master."
234929,L432240,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,...And what is this?
234930,L432223,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,Tie them that they may watch.
234931,L432222,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,A situation easily remedied.
234932,L432221,u6970,m466,PRINCESS OF DARKNESS,But they are not yet one of us.
234933,L432294,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"Yes, sir, Master."
234934,L432293,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest."
234935,L432292,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master"
234936,L432284,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
234937,L432283,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,Then it is some service you desire of us.
234938,L432282,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,Aaaahhhh.
234939,L432281,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you."
234940,L432280,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
234941,L432279,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,Then why do you shake so?
234942,L432278,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"We don't know of anything, Master..."
234943,L432277,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,You know better than that.
234944,L432276,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"Have we in some way made you angry, Master?"
234945,L432218,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me."
234946,L432217,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,Live ones where only the dead should be?
234947,L432216,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"Yes, Master."
234948,L432215,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,They are live ones?
234949,L432331,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
234950,L432330,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,No. No! No!
234951,L432321,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"You need not worry...Not just now, anyway."
234952,L432320,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
234953,L432319,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
234954,L432318,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
234955,L432183,u6971,m466,SHIRLEY,I'm so frightened.
234956,L432182,u6969,m466,CRISWELL,"Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!"
234957,L432342,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"Without the snake, of course."
234958,L432341,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
234959,L432340,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,I could make her another Cleopatra...
234960,L432271,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
234961,L432270,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aannnnaahhnn.
234962,L432269,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
234963,L432268,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aannnnaahhnn.
234964,L432267,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
234965,L432266,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
234966,L432265,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,What do you suppose for?
234967,L432264,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
234968,L432263,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,He wants us.
234969,L432259,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aaarrrgggaahh.
234970,L432258,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of."
234971,L432257,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
234972,L432256,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things."
234973,L432255,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
234974,L432254,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!"
234975,L432253,u6973,m466,THE WOLF MAN,Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
234976,L432252,u6972,m466,THE MUMMY,"I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop."
234977,L433314,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first."
234978,L433313,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool."
234979,L433312,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Glenn Michaels.
234980,L433311,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something."
234981,L433310,u6980,m467,FOLEY,What're you talking about?
234982,L433309,u6974,m467,ADELE,And the one driving the other car?
234983,L433308,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing..."
234984,L433307,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--"
234985,L433306,u6980,m467,FOLEY,What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
234986,L433305,u6974,m467,ADELE,What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
234987,L433304,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
234988,L433303,u6974,m467,ADELE,So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
234989,L433302,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I said not as a rule.
234990,L433301,u6974,m467,ADELE,Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
234991,L433300,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty."
234992,L433299,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?"
234993,L433298,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?"
234994,L433883,u6977,m467,CHINO,"Tell me, how do you do that?"
234995,L433882,u6974,m467,ADELE,Yes.
234996,L433881,u6977,m467,CHINO,You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
234997,L433880,u6974,m467,ADELE,Yes.
234998,L433876,u6977,m467,CHINO,What?!
234999,L433875,u6974,m467,ADELE,Lie face down on the floor.
235000,L433837,u6974,m467,ADELE,Who is it?
235001,L433836,u6977,m467,CHINO,"I want to speak with you, please."
235002,L433788,u6977,m467,CHINO,Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
235003,L433787,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Yes, it is."
235004,L433786,u6977,m467,CHINO,"Oh, is this Adele?"
235005,L433903,u6983,m467,KAREN,Thank you.
235006,L433902,u6974,m467,ADELE,You're good.
235007,L433850,u6974,m467,ADELE,Who are you?
235008,L433849,u6983,m467,KAREN,Ask him his name.
235009,L433833,u6983,m467,KAREN,Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
235010,L433832,u6974,m467,ADELE,"That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that."
235011,L433831,u6983,m467,KAREN,Till they got busted.
235012,L433830,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together."
235013,L433829,u6974,m467,ADELE,Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
235014,L433828,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself."
235015,L433827,u6983,m467,KAREN,Really.  Hm.
235016,L433826,u6974,m467,ADELE,"I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean."
235017,L433825,u6974,m467,ADELE,"He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, ""Okay.""  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband."
235018,L433824,u6983,m467,KAREN,Did you know that when you married him?
235019,L433823,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done."
235020,L433822,u6983,m467,KAREN,"He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life."
235021,L433821,u6974,m467,ADELE,He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
235022,L433820,u6983,m467,KAREN,He called the day he escaped.
235023,L433819,u6974,m467,ADELE,He'd call every once in a while.
235024,L433818,u6983,m467,KAREN,But you spoke to him on the phone.
235025,L433817,u6974,m467,ADELE,"I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer."
235026,L433816,u6983,m467,KAREN,Why not?
235027,L433815,u6974,m467,ADELE,He didn't want me to.
235028,L433814,u6983,m467,KAREN,You didn't visit him in prison.
235029,L433813,u6974,m467,ADELE,He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
235030,L433812,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative."
235031,L433811,u6974,m467,ADELE,"He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?"
235032,L433808,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No, thanks."
235033,L433807,u6974,m467,ADELE,"I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?"
235034,L433806,u6974,m467,ADELE,I know a Glenn.
235035,L433805,u6983,m467,KAREN,"But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?"
235036,L433804,u6974,m467,ADELE,"They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions."
235037,L433803,u6983,m467,KAREN,The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
235038,L433802,u6983,m467,KAREN,From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
235039,L433801,u6974,m467,ADELE,You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
235040,L433859,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,"Why you want to do that, to a frien'?"
235041,L433858,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Go away, or I'll call the police."
235042,L433857,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,"Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak."
235043,L433856,u6974,m467,ADELE,I don't know where he is.
235044,L433855,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,"Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more."
235045,L433854,u6974,m467,ADELE,Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
235046,L433848,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
235047,L433847,u6974,m467,ADELE,I'm not dressed.
235048,L433845,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,"Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name."
235049,L433844,u6974,m467,ADELE,You say you perform in the Miami area?
235050,L433843,u6974,m467,ADELE,His assistant.
235051,L433842,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,"You were his what, his box?"
235052,L433841,u6974,m467,ADELE,"Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years."
235053,L433840,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,"You did work for Emil, right?"
235054,L433839,u6974,m467,ADELE,Oh.  Uh-huh.
235055,L433838,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,"I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you."
235056,L433835,u6974,m467,ADELE,Yes.
235057,L433834,u6978,m467,CHINO'S VOICE,Adele?  You in there?
235058,L434534,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone."
235059,L434533,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Jack --
235060,L434532,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars."
235061,L434531,u6975,m467,BUDDY,I'll go with you.
235062,L434530,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I'm going back inside.
235063,L434529,u6975,m467,BUDDY,All you gotta do is get in.
235064,L434528,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"We made it, didn't we?"
235065,L434527,u6975,m467,BUDDY,At least.
235066,L434526,u6980,m467,FOLEY,And then they'll kill 'em.
235067,L434525,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too."
235068,L434524,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they."
235069,L434523,u6975,m467,BUDDY,What?
235070,L434522,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Shit.
235071,L434521,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Come <i>on</i>.
235072,L434508,u6980,m467,FOLEY,They sure do.
235073,L434507,u6975,m467,BUDDY,They look like plain old rocks.
235074,L434490,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Yeah, hi.  Nice house."
235075,L434489,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?"
235076,L434488,u6975,m467,BUDDY,They found the safe.
235077,L434453,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
235078,L434452,u6975,m467,BUDDY,I don't ski.
235079,L434451,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You ever wear one of these?
235080,L434431,u6975,m467,BUDDY,I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
235081,L434430,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"There's still time, take me up on my offer."
235082,L434409,u6975,m467,BUDDY,And who watches your back?
235083,L434408,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Getting me out of Glades for starters.
235084,L434407,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Half for doing what?
235085,L434406,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half."
235086,L434405,u6975,m467,BUDDY,But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
235087,L434404,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I get that feeling, yeah."
235088,L434403,u6975,m467,BUDDY,You know they gonna set us up.
235089,L434402,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Whatta you wanna do?
235090,L434401,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth."
235091,L434344,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I don't know.
235092,L434343,u6975,m467,BUDDY,So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
235093,L434342,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, I did."
235094,L434341,u6975,m467,BUDDY,You find out?
235095,L434340,u6980,m467,FOLEY,It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
235096,L434339,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
235097,L434338,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You know how I felt about her.
235098,L434337,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?"
235099,L434336,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yes, she did."
235100,L434335,u6975,m467,BUDDY,And she saw you?
235101,L434334,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I saw Karen Sisco.
235102,L434333,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?"
235103,L434227,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Yeah, and I better call my sister."
235104,L434226,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?"
235105,L434202,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?"
235106,L434201,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"They put a gun on you, you'll go back."
235107,L434200,u6975,m467,BUDDY,You might not have a choice.
235108,L434199,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it."
235109,L434198,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?"
235110,L434197,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?"
235111,L434196,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide."
235112,L434195,u6975,m467,BUDDY,What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
235113,L434194,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?"
235114,L434193,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life."
235115,L434192,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>."
235116,L434191,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?"
235117,L434190,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way."
235118,L434189,u6975,m467,BUDDY,No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
235119,L434188,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison."
235120,L434187,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Now that's a really big house.
235121,L434115,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
235122,L434114,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up."
235123,L434113,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again."
235124,L434112,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Forty-five minutes.
235125,L434111,u6980,m467,FOLEY,How long were you with the girl?
235126,L434110,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Two hours.
235127,L434109,u6980,m467,FOLEY,How long you talk to her?
235128,L434108,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Just hung up.
235129,L434107,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You tell your sister about it?
235130,L434106,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it."
235131,L434105,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
235132,L434104,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather."
235133,L434103,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us."
235134,L434102,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Outside of that.
235135,L434045,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"What's he do now, tell fortunes?"
235136,L434044,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
235137,L434032,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Or two.
235138,L434031,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
235139,L434030,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Whatta you think?
235140,L434017,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Love is funny.
235141,L434016,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"""Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying.""  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years."
235142,L433938,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"She just sat there, looking right at me."
235143,L433937,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way."
235144,L433909,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk."
235145,L433908,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now."
235146,L433907,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?"
235147,L433906,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking."
235148,L433905,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?"
235149,L433904,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of."
235150,L433800,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Now you're talkin'.
235151,L433799,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Let's go to Detroit.
235152,L433798,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Sure looks that way.
235153,L433797,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I guess Adele's in good hands.
235154,L433794,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Uh-huh...
235155,L433793,u6975,m467,BUDDY,There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
235156,L433792,u6980,m467,FOLEY,In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
235157,L433791,u6975,m467,BUDDY,You at least bring the gun?
235158,L433790,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I'm a tourist.
235159,L433789,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Nice disguise.
235160,L433772,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Shit.
235161,L433771,u6975,m467,BUDDY,And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
235162,L433770,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Her phone's probably tapped.
235163,L433769,u6975,m467,BUDDY,So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
235164,L433768,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit."
235165,L433767,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Jack?
235166,L433766,u6975,m467,BUDDY,He knows where she lives?
235167,L433765,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows."
235168,L433764,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you."
235169,L433763,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
235170,L433758,u6975,m467,BUDDY,You better come see this.
235171,L433757,u6980,m467,FOLEY,What?!
235172,L433689,u6980,m467,FOLEY,We'll leave first thing in the morning.
235173,L433688,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both."
235174,L433687,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Am I going to Detroit by myself?
235175,L433686,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
235176,L433684,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be."
235177,L433683,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?"
235178,L433682,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Just that she got away.
235179,L433681,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
235180,L433680,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu."
235181,L433678,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Maybe this'll make you feel better.
235182,L433677,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
235183,L433676,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you."
235184,L433619,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Sounds great.
235185,L433618,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back."
235186,L433617,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight."
235187,L433616,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate."
235188,L433615,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Oh, man."
235189,L433614,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink."
235190,L433613,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
235191,L433611,u6975,m467,BUDDY,You're right.
235192,L433610,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
235193,L433609,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move."
235194,L433608,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
235195,L433538,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"You're too late, Jack."
235196,L433537,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances."
235197,L433536,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, ""Oh, I had you all wrong""?"
235198,L433518,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"He ain't the problem, Jack."
235199,L433517,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out."
235200,L433515,u6980,m467,FOLEY,His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
235201,L433514,u6975,m467,BUDDY,How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
235202,L433513,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know."
235203,L433509,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car."
235204,L433508,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
235205,L433489,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around..."
235206,L433488,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Do we need him?
235207,L433480,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
235208,L433479,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?"
235209,L433478,u6980,m467,FOLEY,She's coming with us.
235210,L433477,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?"
235211,L433474,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Okay, honey, come on out of there."
235212,L433473,u6975,m467,BUDDY,That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
235213,L433472,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Where in the hell are we?
235214,L433393,u6975,m467,BUDDY,Why don't we talk about it later?
235215,L433392,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
235216,L433351,u6975,m467,BUDDY,"The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug."
235217,L433350,u6980,m467,FOLEY,It's Richard Ripley.
235218,L433926,u6976,m467,BURDON,And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
235219,L433925,u6983,m467,KAREN,Call and tell you.
235220,L433924,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?"
235221,L433923,u6976,m467,BURDON,"You can go wait out in the car, you want to."
235222,L433922,u6983,m467,KAREN,"What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs."
235223,L433921,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator."
235224,L433916,u6983,m467,KAREN,The manager's door is metal.
235225,L433915,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Yeah, why?"
235226,L433914,u6983,m467,KAREN,You're gonna use a ram?
235227,L433913,u6976,m467,BURDON,"You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man."
235228,L433911,u6983,m467,KAREN,They're in 7D.
235229,L433910,u6976,m467,BURDON,You get the key?
235230,L433901,u6976,m467,BURDON,Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
235231,L433900,u6983,m467,KAREN,That's all I wanted to know.
235232,L433899,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force."
235233,L433898,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?"
235234,L433897,u6976,m467,BURDON,What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
235235,L433896,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?"
235236,L433895,u6976,m467,BURDON,Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
235237,L433894,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Sure, Daniel."
235238,L433893,u6976,m467,BURDON,"But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there."
235239,L433892,u6983,m467,KAREN,"All right, but..."
235240,L433891,u6976,m467,BURDON,"There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away..."
235241,L433890,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?"
235242,L433889,u6976,m467,BURDON,What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
235243,L433888,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'm at Adele Delisi's.
235244,L433887,u6976,m467,BURDON,Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
235245,L433886,u6983,m467,KAREN,Daniel.  Listen --
235246,L433885,u6976,m467,BURDON,Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
235247,L433884,u6983,m467,KAREN,Shut up.
235248,L433665,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco."
235249,L433664,u6983,m467,KAREN,You'll have to ask him.
235250,L433663,u6976,m467,BURDON,"We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more."
235251,L433662,u6983,m467,KAREN,You have to know what you're talking about.
235252,L433661,u6976,m467,BURDON,"I have to qualify, is that it?"
235253,L433660,u6983,m467,KAREN,Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
235254,L433659,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations."
235255,L433658,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers."
235256,L433657,u6976,m467,BURDON,"You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too."
235257,L433656,u6983,m467,KAREN,Is that what you would've done?
235258,L433655,u6976,m467,BURDON,"The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?"
235259,L433654,u6983,m467,KAREN,And what happened to Carl?
235260,L433653,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him."
235261,L433652,u6983,m467,KAREN,"When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks."
235262,L433651,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?"
235263,L433650,u6983,m467,KAREN,It was an unusual experience.
235264,L433649,u6976,m467,BURDON,"This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?"
235265,L433648,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Oh... different things, prison, movies."
235266,L433647,u6976,m467,BURDON,What'd you talk about?
235267,L433646,u6983,m467,KAREN,"In the trunk, yeah?"
235268,L433645,u6976,m467,BURDON,You talked to him?
235269,L433644,u6983,m467,KAREN,Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
235270,L433643,u6976,m467,BURDON,There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
235271,L433636,u6983,m467,KAREN,Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
235272,L433635,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?"
235273,L433634,u6983,m467,KAREN,Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
235274,L433633,u6976,m467,BURDON,"That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head."
235275,L433632,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I wanna be on the task force, Daniel."
235276,L433628,u6976,m467,BURDON,"Daniel Burdon, FBI."
235277,L433627,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Hello, Daniel."
235278,L433879,u6977,m467,CHINO,"Excuse me, Adele?"
235279,L433878,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco."
235280,L433873,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You don't, huh?"
235281,L433872,u6977,m467,CHINO,"Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so."
235282,L433871,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You can live or die, it's up to you."
235283,L433870,u6983,m467,KAREN,"If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead."
235284,L433869,u6977,m467,CHINO,I could walk out of here.
235285,L433868,u6983,m467,KAREN,What do you want to bet?
235286,L433867,u6977,m467,CHINO,"You wouldn't shoot me, would you?"
235287,L433866,u6983,m467,KAREN,Put it down or I'll shoot.
235288,L433865,u6977,m467,CHINO,Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
235289,L433864,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now."
235290,L433863,u6977,m467,CHINO,Wait.  You not Adele?
235291,L433862,u6983,m467,KAREN,Leave it where it is.
235292,L433293,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
235293,L433292,u6977,m467,CHINO,"You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come."
235294,L433290,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out."
235295,L433289,u6977,m467,CHINO,"You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you."
235296,L433288,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance."
235297,L433287,u6977,m467,CHINO,Why you think is today?
235298,L433286,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, but I see you moved it up."
235299,L433285,u6977,m467,CHINO,"I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday."
235300,L433284,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You excited?
235301,L434578,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Wait, I know him --okay?"
235302,L434577,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Karen, I told you not to--"
235303,L434561,u6983,m467,KAREN,Oh-kay...
235304,L434560,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?"
235305,L434559,u6983,m467,KAREN,Hello?
235306,L434098,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed."
235307,L434097,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone."
235308,L434096,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'll need a last known address.
235309,L434095,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side."
235310,L434094,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter."
235311,L434093,u6979,m467,CRUZ,Who was the friend?
235312,L434092,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that."
235313,L434091,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too."
235314,L434090,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Detroit, you must be pretty busy."
235315,L434089,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse."
235316,L434088,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No, I didn't know that."
235317,L434087,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"You know, I'm not in homicide any more."
235318,L434086,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee."
235319,L434085,u6979,m467,CRUZ,Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
235320,L434083,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals."
235321,L434082,u6983,m467,KAREN,Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
235322,L434081,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes."
235323,L434080,u6983,m467,KAREN,What is it with crack and transsexuals?
235324,L434079,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation."
235325,L434078,u6983,m467,KAREN,Who?
235326,L434077,u6979,m467,CRUZ,Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
235327,L434076,u6983,m467,KAREN,Quite a mess.
235328,L434075,u6979,m467,CRUZ,Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
235329,L434074,u6983,m467,KAREN,"How are you, Raymond?"
235330,L434073,u6979,m467,CRUZ,"Ironic, isn't it?"
235331,L434558,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You're right.  So why take a chance--
235332,L434557,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?"
235333,L434556,u6980,m467,FOLEY,A little.
235334,L434555,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Nervous?
235335,L434554,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Not until recently.
235336,L434553,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?"
235337,L434516,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Someone down here?
235338,L434515,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Good luck, Richard."
235339,L434420,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I've seen 'em used on TV.
235340,L434419,u6987,m467,MAURICE,You know how to use one a these?
235341,L434418,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Hey.  You learn from doing.
235342,L434417,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight."
235343,L434416,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor."
235344,L434414,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time."
235345,L434413,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"So you've done this before, huh?"
235346,L434412,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it."
235347,L434411,u6980,m467,FOLEY,That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
235348,L434400,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I wasn't asking permission.
235349,L434399,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind."
235350,L434398,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Give me a minute, talk to Buddy."
235351,L434397,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
235352,L434395,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I thought everything.
235353,L434394,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?"
235354,L434393,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is..."
235355,L434392,u6987,m467,MAURICE,The fuck you talking about?
235356,L434391,u6980,m467,FOLEY,We're leaving.
235357,L434390,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off."
235358,L434385,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back."
235359,L434384,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Who's sitting here?
235360,L434065,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater."
235361,L434064,u6980,m467,FOLEY,What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
235362,L434063,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Let's go outside and talk.
235363,L434062,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you."
235364,L434059,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Glenn didn't tell you?
235365,L434058,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?"
235366,L434057,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Like being back in the yard, huh?"
235367,L434050,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Low class of people there, Snoop."
235368,L434049,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?"
235369,L434048,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower."
235370,L433575,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Thirty-two outta what, twenty?"
235371,L433574,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
235372,L433572,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I don't smoke.
235373,L433571,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?"
235374,L433565,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Another C.
235375,L433564,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I bet.  How much?
235376,L433563,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Company, shit.  I watch the man's back."
235377,L433562,u6980,m467,FOLEY,How much for your company at chow?
235378,L433557,u6987,m467,MAURICE,That's right.
235379,L433556,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?"
235380,L433555,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Yeah.
235381,L433554,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"There a problem, Foley?"
235382,L433553,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Sign says ""Shut the fuck up.""  Or can't you guys read?"
235383,L434581,u6983,m467,KAREN,You know what I mean.
235384,L434580,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You just did, for Christ sake."
235385,L434579,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you."
235386,L434573,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I told you, I'm not going back."
235387,L434572,u6983,m467,KAREN,"What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down."
235388,L434571,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"If you don't, one of those guys will."
235389,L434570,u6983,m467,KAREN,You think I'd shoot you?
235390,L434569,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Pretend I'm somebody else.
235391,L434568,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Come on, Jack -- don't."
235392,L434331,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You know.
235393,L434330,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
235394,L434329,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You getting serious on me now?
235395,L434328,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
235396,L434327,u6983,m467,KAREN,You're not dumb.
235397,L434325,u6983,m467,KAREN,I don't know.
235398,L434324,u6980,m467,FOLEY,What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
235399,L434323,u6983,m467,KAREN,Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
235400,L434322,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Why are you mad?
235401,L434321,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking."
235402,L434320,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'm just going to the bathroom.
235403,L434319,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You coming back?
235404,L434314,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me."
235405,L434313,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet."
235406,L434312,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I don't think we should get into that.
235407,L434311,u6983,m467,KAREN,So she did help you?
235408,L434310,u6980,m467,FOLEY,To warn her about Chino.
235409,L434309,u6983,m467,KAREN,You were going to see her?
235410,L434308,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Outside Adele's.
235411,L434307,u6983,m467,KAREN,Where?
235412,L434306,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You know I saw you on the street.
235413,L434305,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
235414,L434304,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out..."
235415,L434303,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I wasn't sure you caught that.
235416,L434302,u6983,m467,KAREN,You waved to me in the elevator.
235417,L434301,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again."
235418,L434300,u6983,m467,KAREN,What were you gonna do with me?
235419,L434298,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Why not?
235420,L434297,u6983,m467,KAREN,You believe that?
235421,L434296,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
235422,L434295,u6983,m467,KAREN,He killed a police officer.
235423,L434294,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy."
235424,L434293,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, but in a nice way."
235425,L434292,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You kept touching me, feeling my thigh."
235426,L434291,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"She did, huh."
235427,L434290,u6983,m467,KAREN,Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
235428,L434289,u6980,m467,FOLEY,That's not what you were about to say.
235429,L434288,u6983,m467,KAREN,You really wear that suit.
235430,L434285,u6980,m467,FOLEY,So do you.
235431,L434284,u6983,m467,KAREN,You like taking risks.
235432,L434283,u6980,m467,FOLEY,It would be worth the risk.
235433,L434282,u6983,m467,KAREN,"If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?"
235434,L434281,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink."
235435,L434280,u6983,m467,KAREN,"If I had answered, what were you gonna say?"
235436,L434279,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I called your room from downstairs.
235437,L434278,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Oh, God..."
235438,L434275,u6983,m467,KAREN,Or once.
235439,L434274,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, ""What if I had stopped and said something?""  It might happen only a few times in your life."
235440,L434273,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Well, does it make sense to you?"
235441,L434272,u6980,m467,FOLEY,It's not a game.  Something you play.
235442,L434271,u6983,m467,KAREN,It's your game.  I've never played this before.
235443,L434270,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?"
235444,L434269,u6983,m467,KAREN,Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
235445,L434268,u6980,m467,FOLEY,How far do we go with this?
235446,L434267,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?"
235447,L434266,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?"
235448,L434265,u6983,m467,KAREN,It smelled.
235449,L434264,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You did?
235450,L434263,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it."
235451,L434262,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I like your hair.  And that suit.
235452,L434261,u6983,m467,KAREN,I don't have a problem with it.
235453,L434260,u6980,m467,FOLEY,A girl.
235454,L434259,u6983,m467,KAREN,"What, as a sales rep?"
235455,L434258,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Is that how you think of yourself?
235456,L434257,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
235457,L434256,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?"
235458,L434255,u6983,m467,KAREN,Love it.
235459,L434254,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You like bourbon?
235460,L434252,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here."
235461,L434251,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Those guys bother you?
235462,L434250,u6983,m467,KAREN,Don't leave me.
235463,L434249,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I can go to the bar.
235464,L434248,u6983,m467,KAREN,It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
235465,L433754,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I just thought maybe you and me could--
235466,L433753,u6983,m467,KAREN,Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
235467,L433752,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island."
235468,L433751,u6983,m467,KAREN,"One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island."
235469,L433750,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me."
235470,L433749,u6983,m467,KAREN,Unless you wanna tell me.
235471,L433748,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
235472,L433747,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?"
235473,L433746,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters."
235474,L433745,u6983,m467,KAREN,My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
235475,L433741,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Because you're having too much fun.
235476,L433740,u6983,m467,KAREN,Why not?
235477,L433739,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You won't do that.
235478,L433738,u6983,m467,KAREN,"There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out."
235479,L433737,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
235480,L433736,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off."
235481,L433735,u6980,m467,FOLEY,How do we do that?
235482,L433734,u6983,m467,KAREN,Think I could have them back?
235483,L433733,u6980,m467,FOLEY,And your gun.
235484,L433732,u6983,m467,KAREN,How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
235485,L433731,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Really.  He has a cop's face.
235486,L433730,u6983,m467,KAREN,That's my dad.
235487,L433729,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
235488,L433728,u6983,m467,KAREN,None of your business.
235489,L433727,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Who was it answered the phone?
235490,L433726,u6983,m467,KAREN,How'd you get this number?
235491,L433722,u6983,m467,KAREN,Yes.
235492,L433721,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You know who this is?
235493,L433476,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Shit...
235494,L433475,u6983,m467,KAREN,Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
235495,L433470,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Uh-huh.  Well, but if --"
235496,L433469,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I mean, romantically."
235497,L433468,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Really.
235498,L433467,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick."
235499,L433466,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Yeah...
235500,L433465,u6983,m467,KAREN,"With Robert Redford, when he was young."
235501,L433464,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>."
235502,L433463,u6983,m467,KAREN,You have to be kidding.
235503,L433462,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
235504,L433461,u6983,m467,KAREN,You'd probably tell me.
235505,L433460,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I mean if you didn't know who I was.
235506,L433459,u6983,m467,KAREN,Nothing.
235507,L433458,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen."
235508,L433457,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you."
235509,L433456,u6983,m467,KAREN,Bleeding on a country road.
235510,L433455,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to."
235511,L433454,u6983,m467,KAREN,Peter Finch.
235512,L433453,u6980,m467,FOLEY,And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
235513,L433452,u6983,m467,KAREN,"<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good."
235514,L433451,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV..."
235515,L433450,u6983,m467,KAREN,Faye Dunaway.
235516,L433449,u6980,m467,FOLEY,That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
235517,L433448,u6983,m467,KAREN,"It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana."
235518,L433447,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?"
235519,L433446,u6983,m467,KAREN,"They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich."
235520,L433445,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Is that right?
235521,L433444,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?"
235522,L433443,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him."
235523,L433442,u6983,m467,KAREN,You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
235524,L433441,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence."
235525,L433440,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do."
235526,L433439,u6983,m467,KAREN,Sure.
235527,L433438,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"We still talk, though."
235528,L433437,u6983,m467,KAREN,Uh-huh.
235529,L433436,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that."
235530,L433435,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time."
235531,L433434,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife."
235532,L433433,u6983,m467,KAREN,"What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up."
235533,L433432,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You don't act like it.
235534,L433431,u6983,m467,KAREN,Of course I am.
235535,L433430,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You don't seem all that scared.
235536,L433429,u6983,m467,KAREN,I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
235537,L433428,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?"
235538,L433427,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison."
235539,L433426,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went."
235540,L433425,u6983,m467,KAREN,"It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor."
235541,L433424,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I thought so, too."
235542,L433423,u6983,m467,KAREN,That's funny.
235543,L433422,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola."
235544,L433421,u6983,m467,KAREN,How many was that?
235545,L433420,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
235546,L433419,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Why, are you famous?"
235547,L433418,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
235548,L433417,u6983,m467,KAREN,"So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway."
235549,L433416,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck..."
235550,L433415,u6983,m467,KAREN,Buddy.  That's his given name?
235551,L433414,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob."
235552,L433413,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this."
235553,L433412,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford."
235554,L433411,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to."
235555,L433410,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life."
235556,L433409,u6983,m467,KAREN,The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
235557,L433408,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?"
235558,L433407,u6983,m467,KAREN,I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
235559,L433406,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Boy, it stunk in there."
235560,L433403,u6983,m467,KAREN,"In my bag, in the car."
235561,L433402,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Where's your gun, your pistol?"
235562,L433401,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders."
235563,L433400,u6983,m467,KAREN,For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
235564,L433399,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?"
235565,L433398,u6983,m467,KAREN,If I could have a little more room.
235566,L433397,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You comfy?
235567,L433395,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys."
235568,L433394,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
235569,L434061,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
235570,L434060,u6981,m467,GLENN,I thought you guys were busted.
235571,L434043,u6981,m467,GLENN,"These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit."
235572,L434042,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Whose blood you got all over you?
235573,L434041,u6981,m467,GLENN,I don't know...
235574,L434040,u6980,m467,FOLEY,What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
235575,L434039,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Yeah?  She said that to you?
235576,L434038,u6981,m467,GLENN,"She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  ""I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."""
235577,L434037,u6981,m467,GLENN,"That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?"
235578,L434036,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Weren't you expecting us?
235579,L433506,u6980,m467,FOLEY,The backseat.
235580,L433505,u6981,m467,GLENN,In the trunk?
235581,L433504,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
235582,L433503,u6981,m467,GLENN,"You're in civilization now, man, ease up."
235583,L433502,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Wait in the car.
235584,L433501,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head."
235585,L433500,u6981,m467,GLENN,I see better with them on.
235586,L433499,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Take your sunglasses off.
235587,L433492,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Oh, nuthin'."
235588,L433491,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?"
235589,L433490,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else."
235590,L433370,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?"
235591,L433369,u6981,m467,GLENN,You think he's lying?
235592,L433368,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with."
235593,L433367,u6981,m467,GLENN,So.  What's your point?
235594,L433366,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks."
235595,L433365,u6981,m467,GLENN,Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
235596,L433359,u6981,m467,GLENN,I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
235597,L433358,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
235598,L433357,u6981,m467,GLENN,You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
235599,L433356,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on."
235600,L433355,u6981,m467,GLENN,"He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!"
235601,L433282,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down."
235602,L433281,u6989,m467,PUP,You know who they are?
235603,L433280,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Looks like tonight.
235604,L433279,u6989,m467,PUP,When?
235605,L433278,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I hear six.
235606,L433277,u6989,m467,PUP,Okay.  How many going out?
235607,L433276,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details."
235608,L433275,u6989,m467,PUP,How many?
235609,L433274,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
235610,L434513,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack."
235611,L434512,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you."
235612,L434511,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,I'm not leaving Midge.
235613,L434510,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I were you, I'd get up and run."
235614,L434506,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Five point two.
235615,L434505,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?"
235616,L434503,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there."
235617,L434502,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time."
235618,L434495,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid."
235619,L434494,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Good God... they're shooting Midge!
235620,L434487,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
235621,L434486,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You gonna write me a check?
235622,L434485,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?"
235623,L434477,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were."
235624,L434476,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
235625,L434475,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?"
235626,L434474,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Have they got Midge up there?
235627,L434473,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
235628,L434472,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Maurice Miller, couple of his friends."
235629,L434471,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?"
235630,L434470,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"How are you, Richard?"
235631,L434469,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Foley?  That you?
235632,L434225,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally ""relaxed..."""
235633,L434224,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?"
235634,L434220,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you."
235635,L434219,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying ""sign in here please"" or ""hey, pal, you can't park there.""  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it."
235636,L434218,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it."
235637,L434120,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons."
235638,L434119,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You goin' right back to work?
235639,L434118,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,What's to think about?
235640,L434117,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I still haven't made up my mind yet.
235641,L434011,u6980,m467,FOLEY,The next time I walk into a bank.
235642,L434010,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,It works.  You should try it sometime.
235643,L434009,u6980,m467,FOLEY,And the guy sent you a bill for this?
235644,L434008,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out."
235645,L434007,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
235646,L434006,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept."
235647,L434005,u6980,m467,FOLEY,The fish?
235648,L434004,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
235649,L434003,u6980,m467,FOLEY,My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
235650,L434002,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick."
235651,L434001,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
235652,L434000,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late."
235653,L433999,u6980,m467,FOLEY,It's a little late for me.
235654,L433998,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever."
235655,L433997,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?"
235656,L433996,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?"
235657,L433995,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,It's a big house.
235658,L433994,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
235659,L433993,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em."
235660,L433992,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Of course not.
235661,L433991,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?"
235662,L433990,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute."
235663,L433989,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,I know what you're talking about.
235664,L433988,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about."
235665,L433987,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks."
235666,L433986,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way."
235667,L433985,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Really?
235668,L433984,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I don't know.  I never used a gun.
235669,L433983,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?"
235670,L433583,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Any time.
235671,L433582,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Thanks for your help.
235672,L433568,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you."
235673,L433567,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Really?  Well, I uhhh..."
235674,L433566,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off."
235675,L433559,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Must be a real soft pillow.
235676,L433558,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Sounds high, doesn't it?"
235677,L433374,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Oh, uh, right, thanks..."
235678,L433373,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer."
235679,L434625,u6980,m467,FOLEY,I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
235680,L434624,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,Like what?
235681,L434623,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about."
235682,L434622,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,"Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van."
235683,L434621,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"She did, huh."
235684,L434620,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,"Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait."
235685,L434619,u6980,m467,FOLEY,And so now you're off to Glades.
235686,L434618,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,Hejira.
235687,L434617,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You must be some kinda walker, Henry."
235688,L434616,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,"Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from."
235689,L434615,u6980,m467,FOLEY,The <u>ninth</u>?
235690,L434614,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,Yeah.  That was the ninth.
235691,L434613,u6980,m467,FOLEY,There were others.
235692,L434612,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,That time?
235693,L434611,u6980,m467,FOLEY,And how long was it before they caught up with you?
235694,L434610,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
235695,L434609,u6980,m467,FOLEY,You busted out?
235696,L434608,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,"Meaning time came, I left."
235697,L434607,u6980,m467,FOLEY,Meaning?
235698,L434606,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,For a time.
235699,L434605,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"You were at Leavenworth, huh?"
235700,L434604,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
235701,L434603,u6980,m467,FOLEY,The flight?
235702,L434602,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
235703,L434601,u6980,m467,FOLEY,"What's it mean, ""No Hair""?"
235704,L434600,u6982,m467,HEJIRA,Islamic.
235705,L434599,u6980,m467,FOLEY,<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
235706,L434381,u6983,m467,KAREN,"If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on."
235707,L434380,u6981,m467,GLENN,"I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am."
235708,L434379,u6983,m467,KAREN,"But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me..."
235709,L434378,u6981,m467,GLENN,Really?
235710,L434377,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up."
235711,L434376,u6981,m467,GLENN,I'm freezing my ass off.
235712,L434375,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Gee, I wonder why not."
235713,L434374,u6981,m467,GLENN,I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
235714,L434373,u6983,m467,KAREN,"But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?"
235715,L434372,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward."
235716,L434371,u6983,m467,KAREN,Why's that?
235717,L434370,u6981,m467,GLENN,"He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him."
235718,L434369,u6983,m467,KAREN,And is Foley a part of this?
235719,L434368,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do."
235720,L434367,u6983,m467,KAREN,Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
235721,L434366,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle."
235722,L434365,u6983,m467,KAREN,But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
235723,L434364,u6981,m467,GLENN,Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
235724,L434363,u6983,m467,KAREN,"What's going on, Glenn?"
235725,L434362,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals."
235726,L434361,u6983,m467,KAREN,"For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for."
235727,L434360,u6981,m467,GLENN,You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
235728,L434359,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel."
235729,L434358,u6981,m467,GLENN,Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
235730,L434357,u6983,m467,KAREN,"The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him."
235731,L434356,u6981,m467,GLENN,"I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?"
235732,L434355,u6983,m467,KAREN,You're not?
235733,L434354,u6981,m467,GLENN,I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
235734,L434351,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?"
235735,L434350,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Jesus, I don't believe it."
235736,L434349,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?"
235737,L433640,u6981,m467,GLENN,"No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in."
235738,L433639,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Glenn, take the exit."
235739,L433638,u6981,m467,GLENN,What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
235740,L433637,u6983,m467,KAREN,Take the next exit.
235741,L433534,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way..."
235742,L433533,u6981,m467,GLENN,"We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--"
235743,L433532,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close."
235744,L433531,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him."
235745,L433530,u6981,m467,GLENN,I remember you now.  Shit.
235746,L433529,u6983,m467,KAREN,Do we have a gun in the car?
235747,L433527,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled."
235748,L433526,u6981,m467,GLENN,"But you're sure we've met, huh?"
235749,L433525,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No, that's not what I'm thinking."
235750,L433524,u6981,m467,GLENN,"It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there."
235751,L433523,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You don't remember me, do you?"
235752,L433522,u6983,m467,KAREN,Glenn?
235753,L433521,u6981,m467,GLENN,"I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--"
235754,L433498,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?"
235755,L433497,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'll send it to you at Glades.
235756,L434028,u6981,m467,GLENN,Why would I do that?
235757,L434027,u6987,m467,MAURICE,No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
235758,L434026,u6981,m467,GLENN,"It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car."
235759,L434023,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl."
235760,L434022,u6981,m467,GLENN,Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
235761,L434021,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"That was some shit, huh?"
235762,L433979,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?"
235763,L433978,u6981,m467,GLENN,"I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here."
235764,L433977,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want."
235765,L433976,u6981,m467,GLENN,"I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine."
235766,L433975,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Right now, son."
235767,L433974,u6981,m467,GLENN,What-- when?
235768,L433973,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own."
235769,L433972,u6981,m467,GLENN,Can I do what?
235770,L433971,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
235771,L433970,u6981,m467,GLENN,Me?
235772,L433969,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Thing I'm worried about is you.
235773,L433968,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts."
235774,L433967,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends."
235775,L433961,u6981,m467,GLENN,What?
235776,L433960,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there."
235777,L433959,u6981,m467,GLENN,"So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?"
235778,L433958,u6981,m467,GLENN,"If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open."
235779,L433957,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?"
235780,L433956,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there."
235781,L433955,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it."
235782,L433954,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass."
235783,L433607,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?"
235784,L433606,u6981,m467,GLENN,You there?
235785,L433605,u6981,m467,GLENN,It's Richard Ripley.
235786,L433604,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Gimme another hint.
235787,L433603,u6981,m467,GLENN,It's a guy you know.
235788,L433602,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
235789,L433601,u6981,m467,GLENN,I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
235790,L433600,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Uh-huh.
235791,L433599,u6981,m467,GLENN,I wanna talk to you about a job.
235792,L433598,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside."
235793,L433597,u6981,m467,GLENN,"Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash."
235794,L433596,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you."
235795,L433595,u6981,m467,GLENN,Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
235796,L433713,u6990,m467,RAY,"We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away."
235797,L433712,u6983,m467,KAREN,Oh...
235798,L433711,u6990,m467,RAY,"Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares."
235799,L433705,u6990,m467,RAY,Great.  We got one of 'em.
235800,L433704,u6983,m467,KAREN,How's it going?
235801,L433697,u6983,m467,KAREN,He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
235802,L433696,u6990,m467,RAY,You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
235803,L433695,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Hi, Ray."
235804,L434185,u6983,m467,KAREN,"You wanted to tussle, we tussled."
235805,L434184,u6984,m467,KENNETH,What's wrong with you?
235806,L434177,u6983,m467,KAREN,Just a minute.
235807,L434176,u6984,m467,KENNETH,"Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants."
235808,L434175,u6983,m467,KAREN,You're not my type.
235809,L434174,u6984,m467,KENNETH,"You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, ""You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you.""  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl."
235810,L434173,u6983,m467,KAREN,Flyweight.
235811,L434172,u6984,m467,KENNETH,"Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?"
235812,L434171,u6983,m467,KAREN,"What'd you fight, middleweight?"
235813,L434169,u6984,m467,KENNETH,I <i>was</i>...
235814,L434168,u6983,m467,KAREN,I can tell.
235815,L434167,u6984,m467,KENNETH,How you know that?
235816,L434166,u6983,m467,KAREN,You're a fighter?
235817,L434162,u6983,m467,KAREN,The State Theater?
235818,L434161,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,"I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me."
235819,L434160,u6983,m467,KAREN,Where do you think I might find Maurice?
235820,L434159,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,"Was a she, name Tuffy."
235821,L434158,u6983,m467,KAREN,What did you call it?
235822,L434157,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,Got run over by a car.
235823,L434156,u6983,m467,KAREN,Your dog was killed?
235824,L434155,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,"Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?"
235825,L434154,u6983,m467,KAREN,He said he stayed with Maurice.
235826,L434153,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,Here?  In this house?
235827,L434152,u6983,m467,KAREN,He said he stayed here last November.
235828,L434151,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,"Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn."
235829,L434150,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?"
235830,L434149,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,You a lawyer?
235831,L434148,u6983,m467,KAREN,No.
235832,L434147,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,"You not with probation, one of those?"
235833,L434146,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
235834,L434145,u6983,m467,KAREN,Thanks.
235835,L434144,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,You like to sit down?
235836,L434139,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,"That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone."
235837,L434138,u6983,m467,KAREN,That's not Maurice?
235838,L434133,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,"You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money."
235839,L434132,u6983,m467,KAREN,I'm looking for Maurice.
235840,L434131,u6988,m467,MOSELLE,What do you want?
235841,L434130,u6983,m467,KAREN,Moselle Miller?
235842,L434592,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"My little girl, the tough babe."
235843,L434591,u6983,m467,KAREN,He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
235844,L434590,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can."
235845,L434589,u6983,m467,KAREN,It's possible.  Why?
235846,L434588,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,You gonna go get him?
235847,L433949,u6983,m467,KAREN,None I'd like to share.
235848,L433948,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?"
235849,L433947,u6983,m467,KAREN,So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
235850,L433946,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,So?
235851,L433945,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address."
235852,L433944,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,I imagine you would've though.
235853,L433943,u6983,m467,KAREN,I didn't have time.
235854,L433942,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,You wave back?
235855,L433941,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did."
235856,L433940,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,He waved to you?
235857,L433783,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping."
235858,L433782,u6983,m467,KAREN,Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
235859,L433781,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack."
235860,L433780,u6983,m467,KAREN,My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
235861,L433779,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it."
235862,L433778,u6983,m467,KAREN,"I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles."
235863,L433777,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
235864,L433776,u6983,m467,KAREN,Not at all.
235865,L433775,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"He remind you of that guy, Tillman?"
235866,L433774,u6983,m467,KAREN,"He's pretty laid back, confident."
235867,L433773,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?"
235868,L433719,u6983,m467,KAREN,Hello?
235869,L433718,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you."
235870,L433707,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,Off a tip?
235871,L433706,u6983,m467,KAREN,Was it Foley?
235872,L433701,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,I see that.
235873,L433700,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break."
235874,L433693,u6983,m467,KAREN,"No, he looks a lot..."
235875,L433692,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,No?
235876,L433691,u6983,m467,KAREN,He doesn't even look like that.
235877,L433670,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas."
235878,L433669,u6983,m467,KAREN,The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
235879,L433668,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,What are you thinking about?
235880,L433626,u6983,m467,KAREN,Huh.
235881,L433625,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"""Hey, yourself."""
235882,L433624,u6983,m467,KAREN,What'd I say?
235883,L433623,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,You were talking in your sleep.
235884,L433343,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,I'd like that.
235885,L433342,u6983,m467,KAREN,How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
235886,L433341,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,We don't get to talk much any more.
235887,L433340,u6983,m467,KAREN,I really gotta go.
235888,L433339,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em."
235889,L433338,u6983,m467,KAREN,Dad...
235890,L433337,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,You used to like it.
235891,L433336,u6983,m467,KAREN,No thanks.
235892,L433335,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators."
235893,L433334,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights."
235894,L433333,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,What're you doing at Glades?
235895,L433332,u6983,m467,KAREN,Can we change the subject?
235896,L433331,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Then they're not separated, are they?"
235897,L433330,u6983,m467,KAREN,He's about to.
235898,L433329,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Oh, he's moved out?"
235899,L433328,u6983,m467,KAREN,Technically.  They're separated.
235900,L433327,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"He's still married though, huh?"
235901,L433326,u6983,m467,KAREN,"He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over."
235902,L433325,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
235903,L433324,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten."
235904,L433323,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?"
235905,L433322,u6983,m467,KAREN,"Thanks, Dad."
235906,L433321,u6983,m467,KAREN,--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
235907,L433320,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,It's a --
235908,L433319,u6983,m467,KAREN,It's beautiful.
235909,L433317,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,Something better.  Open it.
235910,L433316,u6983,m467,KAREN,You fit another Chanel suit in here?
235911,L434497,u6985,m467,MAID,The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
235912,L434496,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two..."
235913,L434480,u6985,m467,MAID,Like a fag.
235914,L434479,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"How do I look, mama?"
235915,L434446,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere."
235916,L434445,u6985,m467,MAID,I don't have any idea.
235917,L434444,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in."
235918,L434443,u6985,m467,MAID,"That's right, just me."
235919,L434442,u6987,m467,MAURICE,You here all by yourself?
235920,L434439,u6987,m467,MAURICE,When's he due back?
235921,L434438,u6985,m467,MAID,He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
235922,L434437,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Out for the evening?
235923,L434436,u6985,m467,MAID,"I told you, he isn't here."
235924,L434435,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
235925,L433760,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her."
235926,L433759,u6990,m467,RAY,"The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes."
235927,L433744,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,That's how you score now?
235928,L433743,u6990,m467,RAY,I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
235929,L433742,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle."
235930,L433715,u6990,m467,RAY,"Yeah, as soon as we got back."
235931,L433714,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,Did you pay the guy the reward?
235932,L433709,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward."
235933,L433708,u6990,m467,RAY,"Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--"
235934,L433703,u6990,m467,RAY,No.  Course not.
235935,L433702,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,"In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, ""Undercover""?"
235936,L433699,u6986,m467,MARSHALL,Likewise.
235937,L433698,u6990,m467,RAY,"I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco."
235938,L434541,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Where the fuck is Foley?
235939,L434540,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Foley's got it.
235940,L434539,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
235941,L434538,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Midge.
235942,L434519,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Where you been hiding, Dick?"
235943,L434518,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Are those <i>my</i> suits?
235944,L434517,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself."
235945,L433580,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
235946,L433579,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
235947,L433561,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Still...
235948,L433560,u6987,m467,MAURICE,Faux goose down.
235949,L433551,u6987,m467,MAURICE,...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
235950,L433550,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"Well, I need that..."
235951,L433549,u6987,m467,MAURICE,That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
235952,L433547,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about."
235953,L433546,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,"I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong..."
235954,L433545,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up."
235955,L433544,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,What?
235956,L433543,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase."
235957,L433542,u6991,m467,RIPLEY,Thank you...
235958,L434500,u6992,m467,WHITE BOY BOB,Are they dead?
235959,L434499,u6987,m467,MAURICE,...the fuck is this...
235960,L434459,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress."
235961,L434458,u6992,m467,WHITE BOY BOB,I found a rubber.
235962,L434387,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads."
235963,L434386,u6992,m467,WHITE BOY BOB,I think he must've fell in.
235964,L434069,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?"
235965,L434068,u6992,m467,WHITE BOY BOB,Ten gees.
235966,L434067,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?"
235967,L434047,u6987,m467,MAURICE,"Jack Foley, famous bank robber."
235968,L434046,u6992,m467,WHITE BOY BOB,We have a problem here?
235969,L437782,u6996,m468,BILLY,"He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?"
235970,L437781,u6993,m468,ANTHONY,What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
235971,L437778,u6993,m468,ANTHONY,"If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!"
235972,L437777,u6996,m468,BILLY,Are you sure they're here?
235973,L437593,u6993,m468,ANTHONY,"No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, ""Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight.""  I've never known it to fail."
235974,L437592,u6996,m468,BILLY,"What, good-lookin' sumbitch?"
235975,L437591,u6993,m468,ANTHONY,"That's your line for tonight, ya know."
235976,L437590,u6996,m468,BILLY,You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
235977,L437820,u6994,m468,BARBARA,"You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever."
235978,L437819,u6995,m468,BETTY,I wish she could forget him.
235979,L437786,u6994,m468,BARBARA,"No, I was."
235980,L437785,u6995,m468,BETTY,He was that good?
235981,L437784,u6994,m468,BARBARA,"Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours."
235982,L437615,u6995,m468,BETTY,"Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect."
235983,L437614,u6994,m468,BARBARA,We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
235984,L437611,u6995,m468,BETTY,Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
235985,L437610,u6994,m468,BARBARA,You mean hiding them?
235986,L437609,u6995,m468,BETTY,Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
235987,L437645,u7011,m468,RED,"Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!"
235988,L437644,u6995,m468,BETTY,Nervous?
235989,L437643,u7011,m468,RED,Only when I'm n-n-n-
235990,L437642,u6995,m468,BETTY,Do you always stutter?
235991,L437641,u7011,m468,RED,How would I know.
235992,L437640,u6995,m468,BETTY,But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
235993,L437639,u7011,m468,RED,"You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange."
235994,L437638,u6995,m468,BETTY,Red...Strange?
235995,L437637,u7011,m468,RED,"He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange."
235996,L437679,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter."
235997,L437678,u6997,m468,BRITISH AIR COMMANDER,"Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?"
235998,L437677,u7010,m468,RAFE,"If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes."
235999,L437676,u6997,m468,BRITISH AIR COMMANDER,"Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying."
236000,L437675,u7010,m468,RAFE,"That's me, Sir."
236001,L437674,u6997,m468,BRITISH AIR COMMANDER,"On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?"
236002,L437898,u7000,m468,DANNY,"I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds."
236003,L437897,u6998,m468,COLONEL,"Too late for apologies, Walker."
236004,L437896,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Sir, I --"
236005,L437895,u6998,m468,COLONEL,"You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance."
236006,L437894,u7000,m468,DANNY,Hale-what?
236007,L437893,u6998,m468,COLONEL,I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
236008,L437892,u7000,m468,DANNY,Sir?
236009,L437891,u6998,m468,COLONEL,Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
236010,L437890,u7000,m468,DANNY,You liked that?
236011,L437889,u6998,m468,COLONEL,"That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base."
236012,L437888,u7000,m468,DANNY,Yes Sir.
236013,L437887,u6998,m468,COLONEL,"You're Walker, right?"
236014,L437752,u6999,m468,COMA,"You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --"
236015,L437751,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Rafe's girl, Evelyn?"
236016,L437735,u6999,m468,COMA,"Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's."
236017,L437734,u7000,m468,DANNY,Yeah.
236018,L437727,u7000,m468,DANNY,What the hell happened to you guys?
236019,L437726,u6999,m468,COMA,The one that slept in my mouth last night.
236020,L437725,u7000,m468,DANNY,What lizard?
236021,L437724,u6999,m468,COMA,Where's that lizard?
236022,L437723,u7000,m468,DANNY,Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
236023,L437759,u6999,m468,COMA,"Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!"
236024,L437758,u7011,m468,RED,"Well, you p-puked on his feet."
236025,L437757,u6999,m468,COMA,"Shit, he's puking on my feet!"
236026,L437733,u6999,m468,COMA,You guys are new?
236027,L437732,u7011,m468,RED,I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
236028,L437730,u6999,m468,COMA,"No, like..."
236029,L437729,u7011,m468,RED,A m-missionary?
236030,L437728,u6999,m468,COMA,Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
236031,L438105,u7000,m468,DANNY,He did.
236032,L438104,u7003,m468,EARL,Who the fuck taught you to fly?
236033,L438066,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers."
236034,L438065,u7003,m468,EARL,"Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy."
236035,L438063,u7003,m468,EARL,"Of the four left, only one is full of fuel."
236036,L438062,u7000,m468,DANNY,Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
236037,L438059,u7000,m468,DANNY,"You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!"
236038,L438058,u7003,m468,EARL,Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
236039,L438053,u7003,m468,EARL,"They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit..."
236040,L438052,u7000,m468,DANNY,"They ready, Earl?"
236041,L438352,u7010,m468,RAFE,Yes you can.
236042,L438351,u7000,m468,DANNY,I can't make it.
236043,L438350,u7010,m468,RAFE,Danny...
236044,L438295,u7010,m468,RAFE,Home of the Brave.
236045,L438294,u7000,m468,DANNY,And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
236046,L438293,u7010,m468,RAFE,"We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing."
236047,L438292,u7000,m468,DANNY,Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
236048,L438280,u7000,m468,DANNY,Longer?  It's getting shorter.
236049,L438279,u7010,m468,RAFE,It's not getting any longer.
236050,L438268,u7000,m468,DANNY,"We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. ""Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork.""  It means ""Who the fuck thought up this shit?"""
236051,L438267,u7010,m468,RAFE,They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
236052,L438266,u7000,m468,DANNY,It's shorter than our practice runway.
236053,L438232,u7010,m468,RAFE,"What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine."
236054,L438231,u7000,m468,DANNY,Maybe just trying to measure up.
236055,L438230,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?"
236056,L438229,u7000,m468,DANNY,We've always tried to beat each other.
236057,L438228,u7010,m468,RAFE,No.  You're trying to beat me.
236058,L438227,u7000,m468,DANNY,What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
236059,L438226,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?"
236060,L438225,u7000,m468,DANNY,Fun today.  Like old times.
236061,L438208,u7010,m468,RAFE,What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
236062,L438207,u7000,m468,DANNY,Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
236063,L438093,u7000,m468,DANNY,I'm out of fuel!
236064,L438092,u7010,m468,RAFE,I'm out of ammo!
236065,L438083,u7000,m468,DANNY,Home of the brave.
236066,L438082,u7010,m468,RAFE,Land of the free.
236067,L438080,u7000,m468,DANNY,Little less.
236068,L438079,u7010,m468,RAFE,I got a half a tank.  You?
236069,L438078,u7000,m468,DANNY,Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
236070,L438077,u7010,m468,RAFE,You hear my okay?
236071,L438074,u7010,m468,RAFE,Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
236072,L438073,u7000,m468,DANNY,They're all over us!
236073,L438071,u7010,m468,RAFE,Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
236074,L438070,u7000,m468,DANNY,It's tight.
236075,L438057,u7010,m468,RAFE,They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
236076,L438056,u7000,m468,DANNY,"This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!"
236077,L438043,u7000,m468,DANNY,Six P-40's.
236078,L438042,u7010,m468,RAFE,What's there?
236079,L438041,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here."
236080,L438040,u7010,m468,RAFE,Where are we going?
236081,L438035,u7000,m468,DANNY,Come on!
236082,L438034,u7010,m468,RAFE,Get me into a plane!
236083,L437987,u7010,m468,RAFE,How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
236084,L437986,u7000,m468,DANNY,"She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am."
236085,L437984,u7000,m468,DANNY,She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
236086,L437983,u7010,m468,RAFE,Fuck you.
236087,L437982,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking."
236088,L437981,u7000,m468,DANNY,I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
236089,L437980,u7010,m468,RAFE,How come you're not pukin'?
236090,L437961,u7010,m468,RAFE,How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
236091,L437960,u7000,m468,DANNY,You left her.  How's that for a fact?
236092,L437959,u7010,m468,RAFE,I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
236093,L437958,u7000,m468,DANNY,So what are you saying?
236094,L437957,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know."
236095,L437956,u7000,m468,DANNY,I was grieving too.
236096,L437955,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her."
236097,L437954,u7000,m468,DANNY,What facts are those?
236098,L437953,u7010,m468,RAFE,We gotta face some facts here.
236099,L437952,u7010,m468,RAFE,"If you can't keep up, don't drink yours."
236100,L437951,u7000,m468,DANNY,You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
236101,L437950,u7010,m468,RAFE,Waitress!  Four beers!
236102,L437949,u7000,m468,DANNY,Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
236103,L437948,u7010,m468,RAFE,I didn't mean it.
236104,L437947,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it."
236105,L437946,u7010,m468,RAFE,Sorry.
236106,L437942,u7000,m468,DANNY,Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
236107,L437941,u7010,m468,RAFE,Upset?  Why should I be upset?
236108,L437940,u7000,m468,DANNY,You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
236109,L437668,u7010,m468,RAFE,"It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me."
236110,L437667,u7000,m468,DANNY,Then why are you looking for her?
236111,L437666,u7010,m468,RAFE,Yeah.
236112,L437665,u7000,m468,DANNY,Didn't you say you told her not to come?
236113,L437607,u7000,m468,DANNY,Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
236114,L437606,u7010,m468,RAFE,I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
236115,L437605,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Nah, you go on."
236116,L437602,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine."
236117,L437601,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people."
236118,L437600,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots."
236119,L437599,u7000,m468,DANNY,"I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?"
236120,L437598,u7010,m468,RAFE,The Colonel helped me work it out.
236121,L437597,u7000,m468,DANNY,How could you do this?
236122,L437554,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!"
236123,L437553,u7010,m468,RAFE,Didn't you say test the limits?
236124,L437535,u7010,m468,RAFE,There's another one!
236125,L437534,u7000,m468,DANNY,Home of the brave!
236126,L437533,u7010,m468,RAFE,Land of the free...
236127,L437532,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Good shooting, Rafe!"
236128,L437531,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Good shooting, Danny!"
236129,L437530,u7000,m468,DANNY,Kill the bastards!
236130,L437529,u7010,m468,RAFE,It's Germans!
236131,L437528,u7000,m468,DANNY,Power dive!
236132,L437527,u7010,m468,RAFE,Bandits at 2 o'clock.
236133,L437741,u7008,m468,MECHANIC,We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
236134,L437740,u7000,m468,DANNY,Yeah.
236135,L437739,u7008,m468,MECHANIC,"Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?"
236136,L437738,u7000,m468,DANNY,What about easier to hit in an air raid?
236137,L437737,u7008,m468,MECHANIC,The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
236138,L437736,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?"
236139,L437910,u7000,m468,DANNY,Hang on.
236140,L437909,u7004,m468,EVELYN,So beautiful!
236141,L437908,u7000,m468,DANNY,From the air?
236142,L437907,u7004,m468,EVELYN,Well...sure.
236143,L437906,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?"
236144,L437905,u7004,m468,EVELYN,He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
236145,L437904,u7000,m468,DANNY,Sorry.
236146,L437903,u7000,m468,DANNY,"I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring."
236147,L437902,u7004,m468,EVELYN,I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
236148,L437901,u7000,m468,DANNY,That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
236149,L437900,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us."
236150,L437899,u7000,m468,DANNY,How's everything?
236151,L437852,u7000,m468,DANNY,...He said that?
236152,L437851,u7004,m468,EVELYN,He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
236153,L437850,u7000,m468,DANNY,I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
236154,L437849,u7004,m468,EVELYN,You were more like brothers.
236155,L437848,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left."
236156,L437847,u7004,m468,EVELYN,He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
236157,L437846,u7000,m468,DANNY,"Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened."
236158,L437845,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come."
236159,L437844,u7000,m468,DANNY,Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
236160,L438277,u7011,m468,RED,Y-Yes Sir.
236161,L438276,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"No baseball diamonds, Red."
236162,L438275,u7011,m468,RED,"Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --"
236163,L438274,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only."
236164,L438273,u7011,m468,RED,I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
236165,L438272,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
236166,L438264,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  ""Lushu hoo megwa fugi.""  It means ""I am an American.""  In Chinese."
236167,L438263,u7011,m468,RED,Then wh-where do we land?
236168,L438262,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
236169,L438261,u7011,m468,RED,"C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks."
236170,L438258,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
236171,L438257,u7011,m468,RED,"And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from."
236172,L438284,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,I know.
236173,L438283,u7010,m468,RAFE,Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
236174,L438282,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go."
236175,L438216,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die."
236176,L438215,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself."
236177,L438211,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man."
236178,L438210,u7010,m468,RAFE,Bombers.
236179,L438209,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
236180,L438201,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late."
236181,L438200,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Well sure, Colonel --"
236182,L438199,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?"
236183,L438198,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Is that the good new, Sir, or --"
236184,L438195,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,Explain what?
236185,L438194,u7010,m468,RAFE,"We can explain, Colonel."
236186,L438193,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,I heard what you did.
236187,L437589,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Thank you, Sir."
236188,L437588,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
236189,L437587,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Thank you, Sir."
236190,L437586,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit."
236191,L437585,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a ""homage."""
236192,L437584,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,"Don't get smart with me, son."
236193,L437583,u7010,m468,RAFE,"How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?"
236194,L437582,u7001,m468,DOOLITTLE,There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
236195,L437842,u7002,m468,DORIE,"You too, 'Mam."
236196,L437841,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"You take care, Dorie."
236197,L437840,u7002,m468,DORIE,"I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun."
236198,L437839,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?"
236199,L437838,u7002,m468,DORIE,"Thank you, 'Mam."
236200,L437836,u7002,m468,DORIE,Respect.
236201,L437835,u7004,m468,EVELYN,What do you get for winning?
236202,L437834,u7002,m468,DORIE,Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
236203,L437833,u7004,m468,EVELYN,How often you fight like this?
236204,L437832,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?"
236205,L437831,u7002,m468,DORIE,"Dorie Miller, 'Mam."
236206,L437830,u7004,m468,EVELYN,What's your name?
236207,L437829,u7002,m468,DORIE,Yes'm.
236208,L437828,u7004,m468,EVELYN,Win?
236209,L437827,u7002,m468,DORIE,Boxin'.
236210,L437826,u7004,m468,EVELYN,How'd you get this?
236211,L437825,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here."
236212,L437824,u7002,m468,DORIE,Sorry to trouble you.
236213,L437823,u7004,m468,EVELYN,Our doctor's gone too.
236214,L437822,u7002,m468,DORIE,"'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this."
236215,L438251,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant."
236216,L438250,u7010,m468,RAFE,It must of been a convincing letter.
236217,L438249,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go."
236218,L438248,u7010,m468,RAFE,What?...
236219,L438183,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --"
236220,L438182,u7010,m468,RAFE,Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
236221,L438181,u7004,m468,EVELYN,Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
236222,L438180,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me."
236223,L438179,u7004,m468,EVELYN,Rafe --
236224,L438144,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --"
236225,L438143,u7010,m468,RAFE,What else can we do?
236226,L437933,u7004,m468,EVELYN,It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
236227,L437932,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up."
236228,L437931,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --"
236229,L437930,u7010,m468,RAFE,It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
236230,L437928,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back."
236231,L437927,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead."
236232,L437926,u7010,m468,RAFE,Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
236233,L437925,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?"
236234,L437924,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything."
236235,L437922,u7010,m468,RAFE,"...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold."
236236,L437921,u7004,m468,EVELYN,How did you?...
236237,L437920,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute."
236238,L437919,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"Why were you sitting here, instead of..."
236239,L437918,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up."
236240,L437663,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"Do one thing for me, before you go."
236241,L437662,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real."
236242,L437661,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe."
236243,L437660,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life."
236244,L437659,u7010,m468,RAFE,I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
236245,L437658,u7004,m468,EVELYN,You waited til tonight to tell me?
236246,L437657,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow."
236247,L437656,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --"
236248,L437655,u7010,m468,RAFE,"I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here."
236249,L437654,u7004,m468,EVELYN,We're all going away.
236250,L437653,u7010,m468,RAFE,There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
236251,L437652,u7004,m468,EVELYN,It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
236252,L437651,u7010,m468,RAFE,The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
236253,L437650,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say."
236254,L437632,u7004,m468,EVELYN,I was hoping to meet him.
236255,L437631,u7010,m468,RAFE,"No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight."
236256,L437630,u7004,m468,EVELYN,Danny's not coming?
236257,L437628,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Nice to meet you, Betty."
236258,L437627,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"Oh, this is Betty."
236259,L437626,u7004,m468,EVELYN,"You too, Lieutenant."
236260,L437625,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you."
236261,L438133,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,"And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw."
236262,L438132,u7005,m468,GENDA,"If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!"
236263,L438127,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
236264,L438126,u7005,m468,GENDA,"We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral."
236265,L438008,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
236266,L438007,u7005,m468,GENDA,"We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral."
236267,L438006,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,"We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this."
236268,L437859,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
236269,L437858,u7005,m468,GENDA,"Brilliant, Admiral."
236270,L437857,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,"Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way."
236271,L437856,u7005,m468,GENDA,"If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance."
236272,L437855,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
236273,L437775,u7005,m468,GENDA,I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
236274,L437774,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
236275,L438330,u7012,m468,ROOSEVELT,God help them.
236276,L438329,u7006,m468,GENERAL MARSHALL,"The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it."
236277,L438328,u7012,m468,ROOSEVELT,So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
236278,L438327,u7006,m468,GENERAL MARSHALL,"There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway."
236279,L438326,u7012,m468,ROOSEVELT,Have the planes made it to China?
236280,L438325,u7006,m468,GENERAL MARSHALL,"We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement."
236281,L438174,u7006,m468,GENERAL MARSHALL,We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
236282,L438173,u7012,m468,ROOSEVELT,What if the Japanese did invade?
236283,L437803,u7010,m468,RAFE,Crank her!
236284,L437802,u7007,m468,IAN,I have'na been able ta --
236285,L437800,u7007,m468,IAN,Fook ya dooble!
236286,L437799,u7010,m468,RAFE,"Learn English, then!"
236287,L437798,u7007,m468,IAN,Fook ya!
236288,L437797,u7010,m468,RAFE,"And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German."
236289,L437796,u7007,m468,IAN,If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
236290,L437795,u7010,m468,RAFE,All of 'em.
236291,L437794,u7007,m468,IAN,Well which of those three ya want fixed?
236292,L437793,u7010,m468,RAFE,"The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit."
236293,L437792,u7007,m468,IAN,Leapin' Jesus!
236294,L437717,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
236295,L437716,u7009,m468,NISHIKURA,You see us as capable of such a blow?
236296,L437715,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,"The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace."
236297,L437714,u7009,m468,NISHIKURA,"You have something to say, Yamamoto?"
236298,L437712,u7009,m468,NISHIKURA,"The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader."
236299,L437711,u7013,m468,YAMAMOTO,If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
236300,L437710,u7009,m468,NISHIKURA,"So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans."
236301,L439323,u7014,m469,BARNEY,"It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off."
236302,L439322,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
236303,L439309,u7014,m469,BARNEY,"I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future."
236304,L439308,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,I'm not telling.
236305,L439307,u7014,m469,BARNEY,"What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?"
236306,L439300,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
236307,L439299,u7014,m469,BARNEY,Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
236308,L439298,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,Peggy Sue!
236309,L439297,u7014,m469,BARNEY,"Hello, Lilla!"
236310,L439342,u7014,m469,BARNEY,It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
236311,L439341,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Do you have to wear that hat?
236312,L439333,u7014,m469,BARNEY,The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
236313,L439332,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
236314,L439331,u7014,m469,BARNEY,"I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you."
236315,L439330,u7014,m469,BARNEY,Stag movies. Smokers.
236316,L439329,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
236317,L439327,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Goodbye, Grandma."
236318,L439326,u7014,m469,BARNEY,Let's go.
236319,L439321,u7014,m469,BARNEY,I'd take better care of my teeth.
236320,L439320,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?"
236321,L439319,u7014,m469,BARNEY,It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
236322,L439318,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore."
236323,L439317,u7014,m469,BARNEY,"It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains."
236324,L439312,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something."
236325,L439311,u7014,m469,BARNEY,"Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller."
236326,L439310,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Do you believe in all of that?
236327,L438434,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
236328,L438433,u7015,m469,BETH,Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
236329,L438432,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
236330,L438431,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
236331,L438430,u7015,m469,BETH,"Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced."
236332,L438429,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
236333,L438428,u7015,m469,BETH,"Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask."
236334,L438427,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
236335,L438426,u7015,m469,BETH,Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
236336,L438425,u7025,m469,PEGGY,But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
236337,L438413,u7015,m469,BETH,It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
236338,L438412,u7025,m469,PEGGY,How do you like my hair?
236339,L438411,u7015,m469,BETH,r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
236340,L438410,u7025,m469,PEGGY,This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
236341,L438409,u7015,m469,BETH,Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
236342,L439263,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you."
236343,L439262,u7016,m469,CAROL,What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
236344,L439261,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Welcome to the singles' scene.
236345,L439260,u7016,m469,CAROL,"After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing."
236346,L439259,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What happened?
236347,L439258,u7016,m469,CAROL,It's that jerk Walter.
236348,L439257,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What's the matter?
236349,L439093,u7016,m469,CAROL,Aren't we a little old for that?
236350,L439092,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
236351,L439084,u7025,m469,PEGGY,That loudmouthed little bitch~
236352,L439083,u7016,m469,CAROL,I bet Dolores told Charlie.
236353,L439080,u7016,m469,CAROL,Come on. What's with you and Michael?
236354,L439079,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair."
236355,L439078,u7016,m469,CAROL,Just what you underlined.
236356,L439077,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
236357,L439071,u7025,m469,PEGGY,On what?
236358,L439070,u7016,m469,CAROL,All right. What's the scoop?
236359,L438880,u7025,m469,PEGGY,He does?
236360,L438879,u7016,m469,CAROL,"Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are."
236361,L438878,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"He is kind of cute, isn't he?"
236362,L438713,u7016,m469,CAROL,That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
236363,L438712,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I don't get it.
236364,L438577,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Yes. Let's stay in touch.
236365,L438576,u7016,m469,CAROL,I'll call you Later.
236366,L438575,u7025,m469,PEGGY,That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
236367,L438574,u7016,m469,CAROL,We're going to take you home.
236368,L438573,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Maddy, what did you do to your hair?"
236369,L438572,u7016,m469,CAROL,Were taking you back to the nurse.
236370,L438571,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Where is it?
236371,L438553,u7016,m469,CAROL,Go on. You can do it.
236372,L438552,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I can't. It's all too much.
236373,L438551,u7016,m469,CAROL,They're waiting. Come on.
236374,L438525,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Well, besides Charlie, of course."
236375,L438524,u7016,m469,CAROL,The only one?
236376,L438515,u7016,m469,CAROL,Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
236377,L438514,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
236378,L438513,u7016,m469,CAROL,"Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance."
236379,L438475,u7016,m469,CAROL,Wouldn't we all.
236380,L438474,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently."
236381,L438473,u7016,m469,CAROL,"After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious."
236382,L438472,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
236383,L438471,u7016,m469,CAROL,"You should have left here years ago, like I did."
236384,L438470,u7016,m469,CAROL,"So he started having affairs, and you got depressed."
236385,L438469,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things."
236386,L438468,u7016,m469,CAROL,You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
236387,L438467,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
236388,L438466,u7016,m469,CAROL,Welcome to the singles scene.
236389,L438408,u7016,m469,CAROL,You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
236390,L438407,u7025,m469,PEGGY,1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
236391,L438405,u7016,m469,CAROL,Peggy Sue!
236392,L438404,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Carol!
236393,L439091,u7020,m469,MADDY,Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
236394,L439090,u7016,m469,CAROL,Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
236395,L439086,u7016,m469,CAROL,You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
236396,L439085,u7020,m469,MADDY,Peggy Sue!
236397,L439076,u7016,m469,CAROL,") Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that ""the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it"". Page eightysix."
236398,L439075,u7020,m469,MADDY,That's disgusting!
236399,L439074,u7016,m469,CAROL,I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
236400,L438875,u7020,m469,MADDY,Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
236401,L438874,u7016,m469,CAROL,Charlie really has a great voice.
236402,L438860,u7016,m469,CAROL,Why do guys do such stupid things?
236403,L438859,u7020,m469,MADDY,Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
236404,L438519,u7020,m469,MADDY,Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
236405,L438518,u7016,m469,CAROL,Lucky lady. Hi.
236406,L439412,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can..."
236407,L439411,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell."
236408,L439410,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped."
236409,L439409,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Then hold me.
236410,L439408,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I'll never give up.
236411,L439407,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
236412,L439406,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Oh, God, Dion."
236413,L439405,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing ""I Wonder Why""."
236414,L439404,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I'll just set it right here.
236415,L439403,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
236416,L439400,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
236417,L439399,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What about Janet?
236418,L439398,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
236419,L439397,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you."
236420,L439396,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue."
236421,L439395,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old."
236422,L439394,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I thought you were...for a while.
236423,L439393,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Charlie? Was I dead?
236424,L439392,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,". Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue..."
236425,L439388,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm trying.
236426,L439387,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Come back to me.
236427,L439386,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years."
236428,L439385,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,But I love you. I'll love you forever.
236429,L439384,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I've got to go now.
236430,L439383,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
236431,L439382,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,What the hell is that?
236432,L439381,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
236433,L439380,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
236434,L439379,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I know.
236435,L439378,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I love you.
236436,L439374,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"It opens, too. Look inside."
236437,L439373,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Oh, Charlie."
236438,L439371,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Of course.
236439,L439370,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Will you take me back to my grandparents?
236440,L439368,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that."
236441,L439367,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
236442,L439366,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, ""Peggy, you're scared."" Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless."
236443,L439365,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,What?
236444,L439364,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
236445,L439362,u7025,m469,PEGGY,How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
236446,L439361,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore."
236447,L439360,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Right here. Now sit down.
236448,L439359,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Let me got! Where are you taking me?
236449,L439357,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,You're going to listen to me.
236450,L439356,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
236451,L439355,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
236452,L439354,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
236453,L439293,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres."
236454,L439292,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Forget it, it'll never work."
236455,L439255,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand."
236456,L439254,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It means I care about you and what happens to you.
236457,L439253,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Does this mean you like me again?
236458,L439252,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?"
236459,L439251,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Just take a look at it.
236460,L439250,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it."
236461,L439249,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest."
236462,L439248,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?"
236463,L439247,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
236464,L439246,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,That's real big of you.
236465,L439245,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
236466,L439244,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
236467,L439243,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
236468,L439242,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
236469,L439241,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
236470,L439240,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,How'd you know about that?
236471,L439239,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell.."
236472,L439238,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while."
236473,L439237,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
236474,L439236,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
236475,L439235,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog."
236476,L439234,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,What're you doing here?
236477,L439129,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!"
236478,L439128,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
236479,L439127,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
236480,L439126,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish."
236481,L439125,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,But what has to be different?
236482,L439124,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!"
236483,L439123,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
236484,L439122,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I just can't trust you anymore.
236485,L439121,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
236486,L439120,u7025,m469,PEGGY,That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
236487,L439119,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
236488,L439118,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy."
236489,L439117,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man."
236490,L439116,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?"
236491,L439115,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this."
236492,L439114,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
236493,L439113,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did ""Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..."" I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?"
236494,L439112,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride."
236495,L439111,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
236496,L439110,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Let's go down to the basement.
236497,L439109,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What are you doing here?
236498,L439108,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I have to talk to you..
236499,L439107,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
236500,L439040,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
236501,L439039,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What am I going to do with you?
236502,L439038,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you."
236503,L439037,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Why?
236504,L439036,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?"
236505,L439035,u7025,m469,PEGGY,But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
236506,L439034,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
236507,L439033,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Charlie. About last nights..
236508,L439032,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Nothing.. Selling is selling.
236509,L439031,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What do you know about classical music?
236510,L438915,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Save it.
236511,L438914,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm sorry Charlie.
236512,L438913,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
236513,L438912,u7025,m469,PEGGY,This is a mistake. We better forget it.
236514,L438910,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late."
236515,L438909,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
236516,L438908,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Who?
236517,L438907,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
236518,L438906,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
236519,L438905,u7025,m469,PEGGY,A lot's happened since last weekend.
236520,L438904,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
236521,L438903,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Charlie, let's make love."
236522,L438902,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
236523,L438901,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You really love me, don't you?"
236524,L438900,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
236525,L438899,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
236526,L438896,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites."
236527,L438895,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You're pretty charming when you want to be.
236528,L438894,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
236529,L438892,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Come on, let's dance."
236530,L438891,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
236531,L438890,u7025,m469,PEGGY,He's trying.
236532,L438889,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
236533,L438888,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?"
236534,L438841,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
236535,L438840,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
236536,L438839,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Charlie, how are you?"
236537,L438838,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Is this slow enough for you?
236538,L438837,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Right. I promised my mother.
236539,L438836,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?"
236540,L438835,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
236541,L438834,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Great, isn't it?"
236542,L438833,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Where did you get that sweater?
236543,L438743,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Good.
236544,L438742,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Yeah. Like that.
236545,L438741,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Rejected, worthless, miserable."
236546,L438740,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah..."
236547,L438739,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I thought it had a lot of merit.
236548,L438738,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
236549,L438737,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Thanks.
236550,L438736,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Looking good out there.
236551,L438683,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Would I?!! Why I oughta...
236552,L438682,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Would you?
236553,L438681,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Want me to drive you home later?
236554,L438679,u7025,m469,PEGGY,They'll learn to live with it.
236555,L438678,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?"
236556,L438677,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Why wait?
236557,L438676,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
236558,L438675,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
236559,L438674,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Maybe I blocked it out.
236560,L438673,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
236561,L438672,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Refresh my memory.
236562,L438671,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
236563,L438670,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Oh yeah?
236564,L438669,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night."
236565,L438668,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I call this the staccato.
236566,L438667,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You drive like a maniac!
236567,L438666,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today."
236568,L438665,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years."
236569,L438663,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Pretty strange.
236570,L438662,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,How do you feel?
236571,L438558,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway."
236572,L438557,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Charlie! Am I dead?
236573,L438556,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
236574,L438392,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I'm not going.
236575,L438391,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
236576,L438390,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day."
236577,L438389,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I know. Put Scott through college.
236578,L438388,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to..."
236579,L438387,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
236580,L438386,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,You got a Tab?
236581,L438384,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office."
236582,L438383,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here."
236583,L438382,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
236584,L438381,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
236585,L438380,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it."
236586,L438379,u7025,m469,PEGGY,There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
236587,L438369,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,And nothing will ever change that.
236588,L438368,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off."
236589,L438367,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,But you love me don't you?
236590,L438366,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
236591,L438365,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
236592,L438364,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
236593,L438363,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Charlie...
236594,L438362,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,We're here on the sofa bed...
236595,L438361,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Don't say that...
236596,L438360,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,And we're here on the couch...
236597,L438832,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,Of course.
236598,L438831,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself."
236599,L438830,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"What would that be, sir?"
236600,L438829,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
236601,L438821,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands."
236602,L438820,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter."
236603,L438819,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school."
236604,L438817,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes."
236605,L438816,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Yes, sir."
236606,L438813,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you."
236607,L438812,u7017,m469,CHARLIE,"Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?"
236608,L438811,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Hello, Charlie."
236609,L439273,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Have a nice day.
236610,L439272,u7018,m469,DOLORES,Take a long walk on a short pier.
236611,L439271,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I beg your pardon?
236612,L439270,u7018,m469,DOLORES,Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
236613,L439269,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
236614,L438886,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Touchy, touchy!"
236615,L438885,u7018,m469,DOLORES,Are you for real?
236616,L438884,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion."
236617,L438883,u7018,m469,DOLORES,"God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends."
236618,L438882,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out."
236619,L438881,u7018,m469,DOLORES,"Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today."
236620,L438689,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Test?
236621,L438688,u7018,m469,DOLORES,Did you study for the test?
236622,L438939,u7018,m469,DOLORES,First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
236623,L438938,u7028,m469,TERRY,That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
236624,L438937,u7018,m469,DOLORES,There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
236625,L438936,u7028,m469,TERRY,"What, why?"
236626,L438935,u7018,m469,DOLORES,Terry! Slow down.
236627,L438934,u7028,m469,TERRY,Okay.
236628,L438933,u7018,m469,DOLORES,"Terry, slow down."
236629,L438898,u7028,m469,TERRY,What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
236630,L438897,u7018,m469,DOLORES,"Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand."
236631,L439325,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,"He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late."
236632,L439324,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings."
236633,L439316,u7025,m469,PEGGY,My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
236634,L439315,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
236635,L439314,u7025,m469,PEGGY,But I'm remembering the future.
236636,L439313,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,"If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday."
236637,L439306,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
236638,L439305,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I wish she hadn't.
236639,L439304,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,"You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died."
236640,L439302,u7019,m469,ELIZABETH,"That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday."
236641,L439301,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?"
236642,L439089,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
236643,L439088,u7020,m469,MADDY,"But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type."
236644,L439087,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants."
236645,L439082,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet."
236646,L439081,u7020,m469,MADDY,Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
236647,L439073,u7025,m469,PEGGY,She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
236648,L439072,u7020,m469,MADDY,How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
236649,L438877,u7020,m469,MADDY,"Come on, where's your enthusiasm?"
236650,L438876,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Don't get your hopes up.
236651,L438442,u7020,m469,MADDY,It must run in the family.
236652,L438441,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
236653,L438438,u7020,m469,MADDY,I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
236654,L438437,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It was Beth's idea.
236655,L439222,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
236656,L439221,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What?
236657,L439220,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
236658,L439219,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,Can we split now?
236659,L439218,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I thought I knew everything about him.
236660,L439217,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
236661,L439216,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Ssh. He's great.
236662,L439213,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,What a treat.
236663,L439212,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It's Charlie!
236664,L439211,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
236665,L439210,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
236666,L439209,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,You think so?
236667,L439208,u7025,m469,PEGGY,That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
236668,L439207,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
236669,L439206,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me."
236670,L439205,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
236671,L439203,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I hate chickens.
236672,L439202,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
236673,L439201,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I can't do that.
236674,L439200,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us."
236675,L439199,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
236676,L439198,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and..."
236677,L439197,u7025,m469,PEGGY,For everyone.
236678,L439196,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
236679,L439194,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
236680,L439193,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid."
236681,L438955,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you."
236682,L438954,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'd love to.
236683,L438953,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?"
236684,L438952,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Is that one of your poems?
236685,L438951,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
236686,L438949,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance."
236687,L438948,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
236688,L438947,u7025,m469,PEGGY,They care about you. They're just a different generation.
236689,L438946,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club."
236690,L438945,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Don't you get along with your parents?
236691,L438944,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'"
236692,L438943,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What are you shooting for?
236693,L438942,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
236694,L438941,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here."
236695,L438940,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,This is great reefer.
236696,L438932,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Hey, man, I'm a hip chick."
236697,L438931,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
236698,L438930,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Coffee and a donut.
236699,L438929,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,What're you doing here anyway?
236700,L438928,u7025,m469,PEGGY,The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
236701,L438927,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!"
236702,L438926,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
236703,L438925,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk..."
236704,L438924,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You don't?
236705,L438923,u7021,m469,MICHAEL,"Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature."
236706,L438922,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
236707,L439232,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!"
236708,L439231,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Oh, you're both so naive."
236709,L439226,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?"
236710,L439225,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Oh no!
236711,L439224,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now."
236712,L439223,u7025,m469,PEGGY,How did it go with the pantyhose?
236713,L439106,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Wrong, Dad. Your idea."
236714,L439105,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
236715,L439102,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night."
236716,L439101,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them."
236717,L439096,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
236718,L439095,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?"
236719,L439059,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
236720,L439058,u7025,m469,PEGGY,He'll win.
236721,L439057,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
236722,L439056,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats."
236723,L439055,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up."
236724,L439054,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Yes.
236725,L439053,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?"
236726,L439052,u7025,m469,PEGGY,The hat business is in trouble.
236727,L439051,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,This morning was good.
236728,L439050,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Quiet today?
236729,L439049,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
236730,L439048,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I wanted to apologize for this morning.
236731,L439047,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank."
236732,L439046,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I closed my Christmas club.
236733,L439044,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Open it.
236734,L439043,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,For me?
236735,L439042,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,Doing some shopping?
236736,L439041,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Hi, Dad."
236737,L438980,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Evelyn, take her to her room!"
236738,L438979,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!"
236739,L438978,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
236740,L438977,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school."
236741,L438976,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into."
236742,L438975,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I think they're going to deregulate it.
236743,L438974,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government."
236744,L438973,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
236745,L438972,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,All right. But this better be good.
236746,L438971,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
236747,L438970,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
236748,L438969,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
236749,L438968,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,Thank God for that.
236750,L438967,u7025,m469,PEGGY,At my age? Don't be silly.
236751,L438966,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?"
236752,L438965,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It's not Charlie. It's me.
236753,L438964,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,Damn that Charlie I
236754,L438647,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I think I'm way ahead of them.
236755,L438646,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?"
236756,L438643,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Mom, is there any coffee left?"
236757,L438642,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits."
236758,L438641,u7025,m469,PEGGY,That would be impossible.
236759,L438640,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
236760,L438626,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Evelyn, put her to bed."
236761,L438625,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor."
236762,L438622,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
236763,L438621,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
236764,L438620,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Just a little. I've had a tough day.
236765,L438619,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Young lady, you're drunk!"
236766,L439230,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
236767,L439229,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Peggy Sue, watch your mouth."
236768,L439068,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"We'll make it, we'll be fine."
236769,L439067,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Jack, I was just trying to help."
236770,L439066,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
236771,L439065,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Does everybody have to hear?
236772,L439063,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Please don't shout.
236773,L439062,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
236774,L438631,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"You have four seasons, you have four slumps."
236775,L438630,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,"Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump."
236776,L438629,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,A new car. We can't afford a new car.
236777,L438624,u7022,m469,MR. KELCHER,This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
236778,L438623,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded."
236779,L439228,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit."
236780,L439227,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards."
236781,L439180,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?"
236782,L439179,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
236783,L439178,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie."
236784,L439177,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,What does Charlie think about that?
236785,L439176,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO."
236786,L439173,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?"
236787,L439172,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you."
236788,L439104,u7025,m469,PEGGY,We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
236789,L439103,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Isn't that awfully forward?
236790,L439098,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
236791,L439097,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Would they go over my girdle or under?
236792,L438982,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Way to go, Mom!"
236793,L438981,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,I'm not the maid!
236794,L438963,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
236795,L438962,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Where have you been?
236796,L438827,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares."
236797,L438826,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I don't feel very festive.
236798,L438825,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Maddy's party.
236799,L438824,u7025,m469,PEGGY,For what?
236800,L438823,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
236801,L438810,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it."
236802,L438809,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What do you mean?
236803,L438808,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
236804,L438807,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
236805,L438806,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning."
236806,L438805,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize."
236807,L438804,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter."
236808,L438803,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?"
236809,L438802,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are."
236810,L438801,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I had a dream that Grandma died.
236811,L438800,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,What happened to you?
236812,L438798,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma."
236813,L438797,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
236814,L438796,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Sure, Mom.  Hello."
236815,L438795,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Would you get that, dear?"
236816,L438794,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
236817,L438793,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?"
236818,L438792,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Who was that man?
236819,L438661,u7025,m469,PEGGY,The house payments.
236820,L438660,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,What about?
236821,L438659,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Sort of.
236822,L438658,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
236823,L438657,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
236824,L438645,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
236825,L438644,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,When did you start drinking coffee?
236826,L438639,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health."
236827,L438638,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
236828,L438637,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Oh. I forgot.
236829,L438636,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
236830,L438628,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young."
236831,L438627,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
236832,L438590,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm home now.
236833,L438589,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,"Of course, dear. You're home now."
236834,L438588,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
236835,L438587,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Mom!
236836,L438586,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,Why don't you go lie down for a while.
236837,L438585,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm excused.
236838,L438584,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,How do you feel?
236839,L438583,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I have a note.
236840,L438582,u7023,m469,MRS. KELCHER,The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
236841,L438581,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Mom!
236842,L439061,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist."
236843,L439060,u7024,m469,NANCY,You think this'll cheer Dad up?
236844,L438654,u7024,m469,NANCY,Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
236845,L438653,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this."
236846,L438650,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself."
236847,L438649,u7024,m469,NANCY,And the butter.
236848,L438605,u7025,m469,PEGGY,They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
236849,L438604,u7024,m469,NANCY,Why not? They're my favorite.
236850,L438603,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Don't eat the red ones.
236851,L438602,u7024,m469,NANCY,Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
236852,L438601,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
236853,L438600,u7024,m469,NANCY,"Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?"
236854,L438599,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
236855,L438598,u7024,m469,NANCY,Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
236856,L438597,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
236857,L438596,u7024,m469,NANCY,Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
236858,L438595,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm just happy to see you.
236859,L438594,u7024,m469,NANCY,What are you doing?
236860,L439283,u7027,m469,ROSALIE,You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
236861,L439282,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop."
236862,L439281,u7027,m469,ROSALIE,"Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics."
236863,L439280,u7025,m469,PEGGY,But accidents can happen.
236864,L439279,u7027,m469,ROSALIE,"I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing."
236865,L439278,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself."
236866,L439277,u7027,m469,ROSALIE,"Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county."
236867,L439276,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
236868,L439275,u7027,m469,ROSALIE,What's up?
236869,L438485,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You have an incredible memory.
236870,L438484,u7027,m469,ROSALIE,"I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school."
236871,L438483,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Rosalie Testa!
236872,L438482,u7027,m469,ROSALIE,I remember that dress.
236873,L439429,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
236874,L439428,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Wait! I'll go with you!
236875,L439427,u7025,m469,PEGGY,No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
236876,L439426,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me."
236877,L439425,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time."
236878,L439424,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Did you break up with Charlie?
236879,L439423,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
236880,L439422,u7026,m469,RICHARD,So are you. You've got a vision.
236881,L439421,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
236882,L439420,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
236883,L439419,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I came to say goodbye.
236884,L439287,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
236885,L439286,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
236886,L439285,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out."
236887,L439284,u7026,m469,RICHARD,What's the matter?
236888,L439171,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out."
236889,L439170,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
236890,L439169,u7025,m469,PEGGY,God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
236891,L439168,u7026,m469,RICHARD,I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
236892,L439167,u7025,m469,PEGGY,That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
236893,L439166,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
236894,L439165,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
236895,L439164,u7026,m469,RICHARD,One... two... three.  You are now awake.
236896,L439163,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I couldn't help it  I loved him.
236897,L439162,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it."
236898,L439160,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen."
236899,L439159,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Will you take of f your blouse?
236900,L439158,u7025,m469,PEGGY,No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
236901,L439157,u7026,m469,RICHARD,You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
236902,L439156,u7025,m469,PEGGY,No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
236903,L439155,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?"
236904,L439154,u7025,m469,PEGGY,We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
236905,L439153,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Silicon is from sand.
236906,L439152,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
236907,L439151,u7026,m469,RICHARD,What will they be made of?
236908,L439150,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
236909,L439149,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?"
236910,L439148,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure."
236911,L439147,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?"
236912,L439146,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"No offense, but you're pretty out of it now."
236913,L439145,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?"
236914,L439144,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
236915,L439143,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What do you know about hypnosis?
236916,L439142,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
236917,L439141,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Like what?
236918,L439140,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?"
236919,L439139,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode."
236920,L439138,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
236921,L439137,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time."
236922,L439136,u7026,m469,RICHARD,That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
236923,L439135,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
236924,L439134,u7026,m469,RICHARD,That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
236925,L439133,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging."
236926,L439132,u7026,m469,RICHARD,What are you doing?
236927,L439131,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Hi, Richard."
236928,L439020,u7026,m469,RICHARD,High tech. I like the sound of that.
236929,L439019,u7025,m469,PEGGY,The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
236930,L439018,u7026,m469,RICHARD,What are you talking about?
236931,L439017,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
236932,L439015,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous."
236933,L439014,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's."
236934,L439013,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
236935,L439010,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Not for you. Okay, there's lots more."
236936,L439009,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
236937,L439008,u7025,m469,PEGGY,There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
236938,L439007,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Come on. You can't be serious.
236939,L439006,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair."
236940,L439000,u7025,m469,PEGGY,When do we start?
236941,L438999,u7026,m469,RICHARD,You're taking advantage of a minor.
236942,L438996,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Sixtyforty.
236943,L438995,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty."
236944,L438994,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Wbat're you talking about?
236945,L438993,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
236946,L438992,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Give me some credit, will you?"
236947,L438991,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them."
236948,L438990,u7025,m469,PEGGY,How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
236949,L438989,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you..."
236950,L438988,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Richard, take it easy."
236951,L438987,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!"
236952,L438986,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me."
236953,L438985,u7026,m469,RICHARD,But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
236954,L438984,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here."
236955,L438983,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world."
236956,L438790,u7026,m469,RICHARD,What if you're not here tomorrow?
236957,L438789,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
236958,L438788,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy."
236959,L438787,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!"
236960,L438786,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack."
236961,L438783,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
236962,L438782,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible."
236963,L438779,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door."
236964,L438778,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What're you doing?
236965,L438777,u7026,m469,RICHARD,There's one way to find out.
236966,L438776,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Am I dead or not?
236967,L438775,u7026,m469,RICHARD,You're giving me the creeps.
236968,L438774,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Come on, Richard, I'm serious."
236969,L438773,u7026,m469,RICHARD,You look pretty good for a corpse.
236970,L438772,u7025,m469,PEGGY,That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
236971,L438771,u7026,m469,RICHARD,I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
236972,L438770,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I don't know.
236973,L438769,u7026,m469,RICHARD,But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
236974,L438768,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
236975,L438767,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969."
236976,L438766,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"How, did you know about my grandfather?"
236977,L438765,u7025,m469,PEGGY,You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
236978,L438762,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me."
236979,L438761,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years."
236980,L438760,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Okay. I promise.
236981,L438759,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?"
236982,L438758,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants."
236983,L438757,u7025,m469,PEGGY,So you think time travel is possible? For people?
236984,L438756,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes"
236985,L438755,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What's inside?
236986,L438754,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other."
236987,L438753,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I	know what a burrito is.
236988,L438752,u7026,m469,RICHARD,That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
236989,L438751,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What's that?
236990,L438750,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"And then, there's Richard's Burrito."
236991,L438749,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed."
236992,L438748,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Sort of.
236993,L438747,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Are you doing some kind of science project?
236994,L438746,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
236995,L438745,u7026,m469,RICHARD,I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
236996,L438744,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What a great kite.
236997,L438729,u7026,m469,RICHARD,All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
236998,L438728,u7025,m469,PEGGY,It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
236999,L438727,u7026,m469,RICHARD,I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
237000,L438726,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I have to talk to you. It's very important.
237001,L438723,u7026,m469,RICHARD,It really wasn't that difficult.
237002,L438722,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Congratulations on the math contest, Richard."
237003,L438538,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while."
237004,L438537,u7026,m469,RICHARD,I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
237005,L438536,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"You're a sweet man, Richard."
237006,L438535,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Dancing with you.
237007,L438534,u7025,m469,PEGGY,What was?
237008,L438533,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine."
237009,L438532,u7025,m469,PEGGY,"Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife."
237010,L438531,u7026,m469,RICHARD,"The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm."
237011,L438457,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
237012,L438456,u7025,m469,PEGGY,He's not here. We're getting divorced.
237013,L438455,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
237014,L438454,u7025,m469,PEGGY,Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
237015,L438451,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
237016,L438450,u7026,m469,RICHARD,You look exactly the same.
237017,L438449,u7025,m469,PEGGY,I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
237018,L438448,u7026,m469,RICHARD,Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
237019,L440479,u7029,m470,CHASE,"My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife..."
237020,L440478,u7036,m470,YOLANDER,"Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead."
237021,L440377,u7029,m470,CHASE,Well... uh... thanks...
237022,L440376,u7036,m470,YOLANDER,"You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town."
237023,L440374,u7029,m470,CHASE,Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
237024,L440373,u7036,m470,YOLANDER,"The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was ""Church"".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?"
237025,L440372,u7029,m470,CHASE,...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
237026,L440371,u7029,m470,CHASE,I... um...
237027,L440370,u7036,m470,YOLANDER,Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
237028,L440490,u7029,m470,CHASE,"God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!"
237029,L440489,u7032,m470,GUS,I was building a doggy door.
237030,L440114,u7029,m470,CHASE,How'd you know that?
237031,L440113,u7032,m470,GUS,I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
237032,L440111,u7032,m470,GUS,"--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?"
237033,L440110,u7029,m470,CHASE,Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
237034,L440108,u7029,m470,CHASE,There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
237035,L440107,u7032,m470,GUS,When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
237036,L440071,u7032,m470,GUS,I suppose so.
237037,L440070,u7029,m470,CHASE,That's Renee alright.
237038,L440068,u7029,m470,CHASE,"I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?"
237039,L440067,u7032,m470,GUS,I hear you moved into town.
237040,L440066,u7029,m470,CHASE,Pretty much so.
237041,L440065,u7032,m470,GUS,Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
237042,L440354,u7035,m470,RUDMAN,Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
237043,L440353,u7029,m470,CHASE,Yes... why?
237044,L440352,u7035,m470,RUDMAN,You took over for Doctor Yolander?
237045,L440351,u7035,m470,RUDMAN,Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
237046,L440350,u7029,m470,CHASE,"Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive."
237047,L440349,u7035,m470,RUDMAN,"I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death..."
237048,L440348,u7029,m470,CHASE,What?
237049,L440396,u7029,m470,CHASE,"He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious..."
237050,L440395,u7033,m470,MARJORIE,I hope he doesn't have rabies.
237051,L440393,u7033,m470,MARJORIE,You sure did...
237052,L440392,u7029,m470,CHASE,I had a little run-in with Zowie.
237053,L440391,u7033,m470,MARJORIE,What happened to you?
237054,L440273,u7033,m470,MARJORIE,"Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young."
237055,L440272,u7029,m470,CHASE,What do they do up there?
237056,L440271,u7033,m470,MARJORIE,He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
237057,L440270,u7029,m470,CHASE,Out?
237058,L440081,u7029,m470,CHASE,"Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way."
237059,L440080,u7033,m470,MARJORIE,I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
237060,L440079,u7029,m470,CHASE,"Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in."
237061,L440078,u7033,m470,MARJORIE,Is something wrong?
237062,L440529,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Anywhere but here.
237063,L440528,u7029,m470,CHASE,So where're we going?
237064,L440527,u7029,m470,CHASE,All set.
237065,L440526,u7031,m470,GEOFF,All set?
237066,L440460,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive."
237067,L440459,u7029,m470,CHASE,"Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die."
237068,L440458,u7031,m470,GEOFF,I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
237069,L440457,u7029,m470,CHASE,What are you talking about?
237070,L440451,u7031,m470,GEOFF,I'm not hungry.
237071,L440450,u7029,m470,CHASE,"Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!"
237072,L440323,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?"
237073,L440322,u7029,m470,CHASE,"""Out."" Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again..."
237074,L440321,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Just out.
237075,L440269,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"I'm going out, Dad!"
237076,L440268,u7029,m470,CHASE,Hey! Where're you off to?
237077,L440240,u7029,m470,CHASE,"Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him."
237078,L440239,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Who was that?
237079,L440238,u7031,m470,GEOFF,I still can't believe she's dead...
237080,L440237,u7029,m470,CHASE,"Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't."
237081,L440236,u7029,m470,CHASE,I think so.
237082,L440234,u7029,m470,CHASE,You alright?
237083,L440233,u7031,m470,GEOFF,What?
237084,L440170,u7031,m470,GEOFF,It sucked.
237085,L440169,u7029,m470,CHASE,Hey! How was your first day at school?
237086,L440122,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"I'll be fine, Dad."
237087,L440121,u7029,m470,CHASE,"You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you..."
237088,L440120,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Sure.
237089,L440119,u7029,m470,CHASE,What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
237090,L440093,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
237091,L440092,u7029,m470,CHASE,What's wrong?!
237092,L440090,u7029,m470,CHASE,It's been a few years.
237093,L440089,u7031,m470,GEOFF,How long ago did this guy retire?
237094,L440229,u7032,m470,GUS,"Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law."
237095,L440228,u7030,m470,DREW,Zowie...
237096,L440220,u7030,m470,DREW,I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
237097,L440219,u7032,m470,GUS,"Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?"
237098,L440183,u7030,m470,DREW,"Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are."
237099,L440182,u7032,m470,GUS,Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
237100,L440176,u7030,m470,DREW,Just until he heals up?
237101,L440175,u7032,m470,GUS,"Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner."
237102,L440105,u7030,m470,DREW,Is he gonna be okay?
237103,L440104,u7032,m470,GUS,Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
237104,L440415,u7031,m470,GEOFF,All the time.
237105,L440414,u7030,m470,DREW,You ever think about running away?
237106,L440411,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Go later...
237107,L440410,u7030,m470,DREW,I gotta go back and do my chores...
237108,L440409,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Dies?
237109,L440408,u7030,m470,DREW,I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
237110,L440407,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
237111,L440382,u7030,m470,DREW,I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
237112,L440381,u7031,m470,GEOFF,What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
237113,L440340,u7030,m470,DREW,"It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie..."
237114,L440339,u7031,m470,GEOFF,What do you mean?
237115,L440338,u7030,m470,DREW,It's weird...
237116,L440262,u7030,m470,DREW,Maybe it takes a while...
237117,L440261,u7031,m470,GEOFF,How can he not have a heartbeat?
237118,L440260,u7030,m470,DREW,You think he'd believe it if he did?
237119,L440259,u7031,m470,GEOFF,You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
237120,L440249,u7030,m470,DREW,He was dead. You know he was.
237121,L440248,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
237122,L440216,u7030,m470,DREW,Yeah...
237123,L440215,u7031,m470,GEOFF,It's getting pretty late. We better go.
237124,L440214,u7031,m470,GEOFF,You never get over it.
237125,L440213,u7030,m470,DREW,"I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually..."
237126,L440211,u7030,m470,DREW,You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
237127,L440210,u7031,m470,GEOFF,You want me to help?
237128,L440207,u7030,m470,DREW,"Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?"
237129,L440206,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out."
237130,L440205,u7030,m470,DREW,"What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive."
237131,L440204,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself..."
237132,L440203,u7030,m470,DREW,The old Indian burial ground.
237133,L440202,u7031,m470,GEOFF,What did?
237134,L440201,u7030,m470,DREW,This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
237135,L440197,u7030,m470,DREW,There's a better place...
237136,L440196,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Why not?
237137,L440195,u7030,m470,DREW,I'm not burying him here...
237138,L440194,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Is this a good spot?
237139,L440168,u7030,m470,DREW,Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
237140,L440167,u7031,m470,GEOFF,What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
237141,L440166,u7030,m470,DREW,Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
237142,L440165,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad."
237143,L440164,u7030,m470,DREW,"I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead..."
237144,L440162,u7030,m470,DREW,Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
237145,L440161,u7031,m470,GEOFF,He pissed me off.
237146,L440160,u7030,m470,DREW,I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
237147,L440103,u7030,m470,DREW,Zowie.
237148,L440102,u7031,m470,GEOFF,What's his name?
237149,L440505,u7034,m470,RENEE,"I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again."
237150,L440504,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Mom...
237151,L440029,u7034,m470,RENEE,"You know everything, don't you?"
237152,L440028,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"I know, Mom."
237153,L440026,u7034,m470,RENEE,I miss him too...
237154,L440025,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom..."
237155,L440024,u7034,m470,RENEE,How did it go with your father last night?
237156,L440023,u7031,m470,GEOFF,Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
237157,L440022,u7034,m470,RENEE,How long have you been here?
237158,L440021,u7031,m470,GEOFF,"Right here, Mom..."
237159,L440020,u7034,m470,RENEE,Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
237160,L440821,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?"
237161,L440820,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"Do you really think so, Andy?"
237162,L440727,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
237163,L440726,u7037,m471,ANDREW,K-R-O-one.
237164,L440725,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,What was the file name?
237165,L440724,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Sorry...
237166,L440723,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Allright. Calm down.
237167,L440722,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?"
237168,L440721,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,What's wrong with your face?
237169,L440720,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Bob...
237170,L440719,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,What in God's name... ?
237171,L440718,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,You'll never find it in the dark.
237172,L440717,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I don't know what to do, Bob."
237173,L440716,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Jesus.
237174,L440611,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations."
237175,L440610,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Yes!
237176,L440608,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Bailey, Brackman."
237177,L440607,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?"
237178,L440606,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull."
237179,L440591,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Charles is right behind me.
237180,L440590,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"In a word, Bob..."
237181,L440589,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"Are we interrupting, Andy?"
237182,L440829,u7044,m471,KENTON,"Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem."
237183,L440828,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles."
237184,L440815,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Really? Who thinks that, sir?"
237185,L440814,u7044,m471,KENTON,"Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett."
237186,L440813,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time..."
237187,L440808,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"There won't be a next time, I guarantee it."
237188,L440807,u7044,m471,KENTON,This time. What about next time?
237189,L440729,u7044,m471,KENTON,Andy?
237190,L440728,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"You're right, I probably just misfiled..."
237191,L440616,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
237192,L440615,u7044,m471,KENTON,"What's that on your forehead, pal?"
237193,L440614,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Thanks, Walter."
237194,L440605,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Because they deserve to, Walter."
237195,L440604,u7044,m471,KENTON,"Why, Beckett?"
237196,L441579,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"I hope you're ready for ""Studs,"" because that's what's on."
237197,L441578,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Whatever.
237198,L441577,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"Ready for what, baby?"
237199,L441576,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm ready...
237200,L441289,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
237201,L441288,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm not ready to die.
237202,L441287,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? ""Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..."" Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!"
237203,L441286,u7037,m471,ANDREW,You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
237204,L441285,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness."
237205,L441284,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm not going to die.
237206,L441283,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Maybe you should think about it.
237207,L441282,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What's that mean?!
237208,L441281,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Maybe you should think about it.
237209,L441280,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? ""Begin to prepare for the inevitable."""
237210,L441279,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,No.
237211,L441278,u7037,m471,ANDREW,You're scared. You think we're near the end.
237212,L441277,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,That's not what I said.
237213,L441276,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"You don't think there's much time left, do you?"
237214,L441275,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time."
237215,L441274,u7037,m471,ANDREW,ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
237216,L441273,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
237217,L441272,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm not going to close the--
237218,L441271,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Close the law book.
237219,L441270,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What's wrong with you?
237220,L441269,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"That shit's saving your life, you asshole!"
237221,L441268,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
237222,L441267,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Fuck you.
237223,L441266,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment."
237224,L441265,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,We're not skipping this treatment.
237225,L441264,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
237226,L441263,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter."
237227,L440993,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again."
237228,L440992,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?"
237229,L440991,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"I said, ""Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."""
237230,L440990,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Jerk... What did you say?
237231,L440699,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I promise!
237232,L440698,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Drew!
237233,L440697,u7037,m471,ANDREW,One hour!
237234,L440696,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
237235,L440695,u7037,m471,ANDREW,You're not smiling.
237236,L440694,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,You're going to the office?!
237237,L440693,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops."
237238,L440692,u7037,m471,ANDREW,You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
237239,L440691,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Why are you getting dressed?
237240,L440675,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,I am relaxed.
237241,L440674,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?"
237242,L440671,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?"
237243,L440670,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,Don't apologize for me.
237244,L440665,u7037,m471,ANDREW,A reaction to AZT...
237245,L440664,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"It could be parasites, an infection..."
237246,L440652,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?"
237247,L440651,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody."
237248,L440649,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"I said, don't worry about it."
237249,L440648,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Aren't you giving an exam?
237250,L440645,u7047,m471,MIGUEL,"Yeah. Thanks, guys."
237251,L440644,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Thanks, you guys."
237252,L441396,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm seeing him this afternoon.
237253,L441395,u7052,m471,WHEELER,Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
237254,L441036,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Don't do this, Andy."
237255,L441035,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor."
237256,L440833,u7037,m471,ANDREW,A carrot?!
237257,L440832,u7052,m471,WHEELER,I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
237258,L440831,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?"
237259,L440830,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Take it easy, Walter."
237260,L440819,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Honesty is always best.
237261,L440818,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you."
237262,L440804,u7052,m471,WHEELER,More than your friend. Family.
237263,L440803,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I know that, Charles."
237264,L440800,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Of course.
237265,L440799,u7052,m471,WHEELER,Thanks for coming in.
237266,L440619,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"No sweat, buddy."
237267,L440618,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Thanks, Charles."
237268,L440601,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way."
237269,L440600,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement."
237270,L440669,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"He's upset, he's sorry."
237271,L440668,u7041,m471,INTERN,"I'm trying to help your ""partner."" You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER."
237272,L440663,u7041,m471,INTERN,"Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away."
237273,L440662,u7037,m471,ANDREW,This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
237274,L440658,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Sounds delightful.
237275,L440657,u7041,m471,INTERN,"... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside."
237276,L440656,u7041,m471,INTERN,We're waiting...
237277,L440655,u7037,m471,ANDREW,About my blood work?
237278,L440654,u7041,m471,INTERN,"Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry..."
237279,L441563,u7042,m471,JOE,You bet. We'll see you later.
237280,L441562,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Thanks for coming by.
237281,L441560,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Sure thing.
237282,L441559,u7042,m471,JOE,I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
237283,L441558,u7042,m471,JOE,"It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?"
237284,L441557,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Excellent work, Joe. I thank you."
237285,L441556,u7037,m471,ANDREW,A good start.
237286,L441555,u7042,m471,JOE,What?
237287,L441554,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
237288,L441486,u7042,m471,JOE,Thank you.
237289,L441485,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Yes.
237290,L441484,u7042,m471,JOE,Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
237291,L441479,u7042,m471,JOE,"If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about."
237292,L441478,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Yes. On my torso.
237293,L441477,u7042,m471,JOE,"Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?"
237294,L441411,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens."
237295,L441410,u7042,m471,JOE,What do you love about it?
237296,L441409,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
237297,L441408,u7042,m471,JOE,What makes you an excellent lawyer?
237298,L441407,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm an excellent lawyer.
237299,L441406,u7042,m471,JOE,Are you a good lawyer?
237300,L441394,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club..."
237301,L441393,u7042,m471,JOE,Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
237302,L441392,u7037,m471,ANDREW,No. I didn't.
237303,L441391,u7042,m471,JOE,"In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?"
237304,L441390,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I still am.
237305,L441389,u7042,m471,JOE,Except... you were gay?
237306,L441388,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I suppose you could say that.
237307,L441387,u7042,m471,JOE,A regular all-American guy?
237308,L441384,u7042,m471,JOE,"You didn't look then, the way you look now?"
237309,L441383,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later."
237310,L441382,u7042,m471,JOE,"Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick."
237311,L441381,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit."
237312,L441380,u7042,m471,JOE,What kind of person is that?
237313,L441379,u7037,m471,ANDREW,He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
237314,L441378,u7042,m471,JOE,What impressed you about him?
237315,L441377,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Particularly, Charles."
237316,L441365,u7042,m471,JOE,"You're ready, don't worry."
237317,L441364,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'll look over the Q and A.
237318,L441357,u7042,m471,JOE,Opera?
237319,L441356,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Want to hear my favorite aria?
237320,L441355,u7042,m471,JOE,Opera?
237321,L441354,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Thanks.  Do you like opera?
237322,L441353,u7042,m471,JOE,I know a good probate lawyer.
237323,L441352,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
237324,L441351,u7042,m471,JOE,"We proceed, representing your estate."
237325,L441350,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What happens?
237326,L441349,u7042,m471,JOE,I've considered that.
237327,L441348,u7037,m471,ANDREW,There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
237328,L441347,u7042,m471,JOE,For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
237329,L441346,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What have you prayed for?
237330,L441345,u7042,m471,JOE,Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
237331,L441343,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Do you... pray?
237332,L441342,u7042,m471,JOE,What?
237333,L441341,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Charles. Okay. Miller?
237334,L441340,u7042,m471,JOE,Beckett?
237335,L441339,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Uh huh...
237336,L441338,u7042,m471,JOE,"When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them."
237337,L441337,u7042,m471,JOE,Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
237338,L441336,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe."
237339,L441335,u7042,m471,JOE,"Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth."
237340,L441334,u7037,m471,ANDREW,You survived your first gay party intact.
237341,L441321,u7042,m471,JOE,You're right.
237342,L441320,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Correct.
237343,L441319,u7042,m471,JOE,You think I'm uncomfortable...
237344,L441317,u7042,m471,JOE,Thank you.
237345,L441316,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"No, we have to do it. But later, allright?"
237346,L441315,u7042,m471,JOE,Sure. It's fine.
237347,L441314,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?"
237348,L441313,u7042,m471,JOE,Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
237349,L441312,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What do you want?
237350,L441311,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Let's find you a drink.
237351,L441310,u7042,m471,JOE,Get it?
237352,L441309,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Not bad.
237353,L441308,u7042,m471,JOE,I'm a law suit.
237354,L441307,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
237355,L441306,u7042,m471,JOE,"Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive..."
237356,L441297,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"It's me, you dork."
237357,L441296,u7042,m471,JOE,We're friends of Beckett's.
237358,L441295,u7037,m471,ANDREW,PARRTYY!
237359,L441027,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work."
237360,L441026,u7042,m471,JOE,"One more thing, Your Honor..."
237361,L440933,u7042,m471,JOE,Arline?
237362,L440932,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Arline decision. Supreme Court.
237363,L440931,u7042,m471,JOE,There is no relevant precedent.
237364,L440930,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Thank you.
237365,L440929,u7042,m471,JOE,"So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent."
237366,L440928,u7037,m471,ANDREW,No. They didn't fire her.
237367,L440927,u7042,m471,JOE,They didn't fire her?
237368,L440926,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS."
237369,L440922,u7037,m471,ANDREW,One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
237370,L440921,u7042,m471,JOE,How did they find out?
237371,L440920,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Rayisha. Very nice.
237372,L440919,u7042,m471,JOE,Rayisha.
237373,L440918,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What's her name?
237374,L440917,u7042,m471,JOE,Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
237375,L440916,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
237376,L440915,u7042,m471,JOE,Find a lawyer?
237377,L440914,u7037,m471,ANDREW,What?
237378,L440913,u7042,m471,JOE,Who'd you get?
237379,L440912,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Fine.
237380,L440911,u7042,m471,JOE,"Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?"
237381,L440852,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet."
237382,L440851,u7042,m471,JOE,Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
237383,L440850,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Thanks for your time.
237384,L440849,u7042,m471,JOE,Correct. I don't.
237385,L440848,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
237386,L440847,u7042,m471,JOE,"I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case."
237387,L440846,u7037,m471,ANDREW,They sabotaged me.
237388,L440845,u7042,m471,JOE,"Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file."
237389,L440844,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today."
237390,L440843,u7042,m471,JOE,"Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?"
237391,L440842,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position..."
237392,L440835,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"As in, the vegetable?"
237393,L440834,u7042,m471,JOE,I buy that.
237394,L440806,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done."
237395,L440805,u7042,m471,JOE,Big trouble.
237396,L440795,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Makeup.
237397,L440794,u7042,m471,JOE,"Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?"
237398,L440785,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started..."
237399,L440784,u7042,m471,JOE,Continue.
237400,L440783,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
237401,L440782,u7042,m471,JOE,Your... lover?
237402,L440781,u7037,m471,ANDREW,My lover and I.
237403,L440780,u7042,m471,JOE,We?
237404,L440779,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it."
237405,L440778,u7042,m471,JOE,Continue.
237406,L440777,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Nine.
237407,L440776,u7042,m471,JOE,"How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?"
237408,L440775,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
237409,L440774,u7042,m471,JOE,Continue.
237410,L440773,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Correct. I'm seeking representation.
237411,L440772,u7042,m471,JOE,You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
237412,L440771,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
237413,L440770,u7042,m471,JOE,"Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?"
237414,L440769,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Kids are great.
237415,L440768,u7042,m471,JOE,Little baby girl.
237416,L440767,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Congratulations.
237417,L440766,u7042,m471,JOE,One week old.
237418,L440765,u7037,m471,ANDREW,New baby?
237419,L440763,u7042,m471,JOE,"Uh, yeah."
237420,L440762,u7037,m471,ANDREW,It's okay. Can I sit down?
237421,L440761,u7042,m471,JOE,"Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I..."
237422,L440760,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I have AIDS.
237423,L440759,u7042,m471,JOE,"Jesus Christ, what happened to you?"
237424,L440550,u7042,m471,JOE,Funny.
237425,L440549,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Client of yours?
237426,L440541,u7042,m471,JOE,"I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!"
237427,L440540,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Defined by Webster's as harmless.
237428,L440539,u7042,m471,JOE,Innocuous?
237429,L440537,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results..."
237430,L440536,u7042,m471,JOE,"Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!"
237431,L440711,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
237432,L440710,u7049,m471,RACHEL,What can I do?
237433,L440709,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution."
237434,L440708,u7049,m471,RACHEL,"I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful."
237435,L440571,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall."
237436,L440570,u7049,m471,RACHEL,"I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing."
237437,L440569,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Rach.
237438,L441470,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Thank you.
237439,L441469,u7037,m471,ANDREW,No. I can't really see it.
237440,L441468,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"Answer the question, please."
237441,L441467,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger..."
237442,L441465,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"One. Here, in front of my ear."
237443,L441464,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
237444,L441463,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Absolutely.
237445,L441462,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you."
237446,L441461,u7037,m471,ANDREW,That's right.
237447,L441460,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?"
237448,L441459,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Yes.
237449,L441458,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Really?
237450,L441457,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread."
237451,L441456,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"You could have infected him, isn't that right?"
237452,L441455,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Yes.
237453,L441452,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!"
237454,L441451,u7037,m471,ANDREW,In some situations.
237455,L441450,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?"
237456,L441449,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Some do. I didn't.
237457,L441448,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
237458,L441447,u7037,m471,ANDREW,No.
237459,L441446,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
237460,L441445,u7037,m471,ANDREW,That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
237461,L441444,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?"
237462,L441443,u7037,m471,ANDREW,No.
237463,L441442,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Do you need a break?
237464,L441441,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you."
237465,L441440,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?"
237466,L441439,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex."
237467,L441438,u7039,m471,BELINDA,But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
237468,L441437,u7037,m471,ANDREW,It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
237469,L441436,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?"
237470,L441435,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"I guess it was 1984, 85."
237471,L441434,u7039,m471,BELINDA,When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
237472,L441425,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Yes.
237473,L441424,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
237474,L441423,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Yes.
237475,L441422,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
237476,L441421,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Gay movies.
237477,L441420,u7039,m471,BELINDA,What kind of movies do they show there?
237478,L441418,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
237479,L441417,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Not unnecessary ones.
237480,L441416,u7039,m471,BELINDA,In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
237481,L441415,u7037,m471,ANDREW,In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
237482,L441414,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Do you take risks?
237483,L441413,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Something like that.
237484,L441412,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had ""an adventurous spirit."" Is that correct?"
237485,L441071,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Thanks, Mom... Dad?"
237486,L441070,u7050,m471,SARAH,"All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights."
237487,L441069,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Mom?
237488,L441064,u7050,m471,SARAH,He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
237489,L441063,u7037,m471,ANDREW,Where's Dad?
237490,L441062,u7050,m471,SARAH,"Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen."
237491,L441061,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?"
237492,L440585,u7050,m471,SARAH,Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
237493,L440584,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too."
237494,L440581,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that."
237495,L440580,u7050,m471,SARAH,What's Dr. Gillman say?
237496,L440579,u7037,m471,ANDREW,I'm fine.
237497,L440578,u7050,m471,SARAH,"Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?"
237498,L440577,u7037,m471,ANDREW,"Hi, Mom. It's me."
237499,L440576,u7050,m471,SARAH,Hello?
237500,L441176,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Thank you.
237501,L441175,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
237502,L441174,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Were you recently promoted?
237503,L441173,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,Yes.
237504,L441172,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
237505,L441158,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Objection.
237506,L441157,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,"He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything."
237507,L441171,u7042,m471,JOE,Thank you. No more questions.
237508,L441170,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
237509,L441169,u7042,m471,JOE,What did you say?
237510,L441168,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,"Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... ""ethnic"" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more ""American."""
237511,L441167,u7042,m471,JOE,Your earrings?
237512,L441166,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,"Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings."
237513,L441165,u7042,m471,JOE,In what way?
237514,L441164,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,Yes.
237515,L441163,u7042,m471,JOE,"No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?"
237516,L441162,u7038,m471,ANTHEA,Is that a question?
237517,L441161,u7042,m471,JOE,Ms. Burton. You're black.
237518,L441481,u7042,m471,JOE,"Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about."
237519,L441480,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury."
237520,L441454,u7039,m471,BELINDA,I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
237521,L441453,u7042,m471,JOE,Objection!
237522,L441252,u7042,m471,JOE,"I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?"
237523,L441251,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Objection!
237524,L441214,u7042,m471,JOE,I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
237525,L441213,u7039,m471,BELINDA,Objection!
237526,L441098,u7039,m471,BELINDA,"Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him..."
237527,L441097,u7042,m471,JOE,"And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages."
237528,L440882,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,"Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years."
237529,L440881,u7042,m471,JOE,Uh.... No. Not really.
237530,L440880,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
237531,L440879,u7042,m471,JOE,Get real.
237532,L440878,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,A homosexual encounter.
237533,L440875,u7042,m471,JOE,"Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really."
237534,L440874,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,"Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about..."
237535,L440873,u7042,m471,JOE,"It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?"
237536,L440872,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,Right.
237537,L440871,u7042,m471,JOE,"The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?"
237538,L440870,u7042,m471,JOE,You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
237539,L440869,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
237540,L440868,u7042,m471,JOE,Why are we going to do that?
237541,L440867,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,We're going to draw blood.
237542,L440866,u7042,m471,JOE,"Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: ""whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?"
237543,L440865,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,Leave that.
237544,L440864,u7042,m471,JOE,Right.
237545,L440863,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,"The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen."
237546,L440860,u7042,m471,JOE,I'm not worried. What are you doing?
237547,L440859,u7040,m471,DR. ARMBRUSTER,"You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried."
237548,L441122,u7045,m471,LAIRD,"Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now."
237549,L441121,u7042,m471,JOE,"Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind."
237550,L441120,u7045,m471,LAIRD,I might.
237551,L441119,u7042,m471,JOE,It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
237552,L441118,u7045,m471,LAIRD,It satisfied me.
237553,L441117,u7042,m471,JOE,"Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?"
237554,L441116,u7045,m471,LAIRD,We won.
237555,L441115,u7042,m471,JOE,"Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?"
237556,L441114,u7045,m471,LAIRD,I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
237557,L441113,u7042,m471,JOE,"According to the deposition, you said you were ""thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed"" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?"
237558,L441112,u7045,m471,LAIRD,That's correct.
237559,L441111,u7042,m471,JOE,"Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?"
237560,L441108,u7045,m471,LAIRD,We were satisfied.
237561,L441107,u7042,m471,JOE,Were you pleased with his work?
237562,L441106,u7045,m471,LAIRD,That's correct.
237563,L441105,u7042,m471,JOE,"But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit."
237564,L441104,u7045,m471,LAIRD,Wyant Wheeler represented us.
237565,L441103,u7042,m471,JOE,"Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?"
237566,L441510,u7052,m471,WHEELER,People who want to bend the rules...
237567,L441509,u7042,m471,JOE,What kind of people?
237568,L441508,u7052,m471,WHEELER,Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
237569,L441505,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job."
237570,L441504,u7042,m471,JOE,"Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?"
237571,L440827,u7052,m471,WHEELER,... we've got a committee meeting.
237572,L440826,u7042,m471,JOE,But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
237573,L440825,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"And I hate to rush you out of here, but..."
237574,L440824,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world."
237575,L440823,u7042,m471,JOE,"In a word, yes."
237576,L440822,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure."
237577,L440802,u7042,m471,JOE,You're in trouble.
237578,L440801,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend."
237579,L441193,u7053,m471,YOUNG MAN,Get a life.
237580,L441192,u7042,m471,JOE,"You're the asshole, buddy."
237581,L441191,u7053,m471,YOUNG MAN,Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
237582,L441190,u7042,m471,JOE,Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
237583,L441189,u7053,m471,YOUNG MAN,Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
237584,L441188,u7042,m471,JOE,Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
237585,L441187,u7053,m471,YOUNG MAN,Do I look gay to you? Relax.
237586,L441186,u7042,m471,JOE,What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
237587,L441185,u7053,m471,YOUNG MAN,Aren't you?
237588,L441184,u7042,m471,JOE,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?"
237589,L441183,u7053,m471,YOUNG MAN,"Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day."
237590,L441182,u7042,m471,JOE,Great.
237591,L441181,u7053,m471,YOUNG MAN,Second.
237592,L441180,u7042,m471,JOE,Good school. What year?
237593,L441331,u7046,m471,LISA,"Night, honey."
237594,L441330,u7042,m471,JOE,"I'll see you in an hour, max."
237595,L441294,u7046,m471,LISA,My lettuce is wilting.
237596,L441293,u7042,m471,JOE,"Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?"
237597,L441206,u7042,m471,JOE,"Great, Lisa. Thank you."
237598,L441205,u7046,m471,LISA,"Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?"
237599,L441204,u7042,m471,JOE,"Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting."
237600,L441203,u7046,m471,LISA,Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
237601,L441202,u7042,m471,JOE,Yeah... ?
237602,L441201,u7046,m471,LISA,Joe?
237603,L441199,u7042,m471,JOE,Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
237604,L441198,u7046,m471,LISA,Have you changed your aftershave?
237605,L441197,u7042,m471,JOE,Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
237606,L441196,u7046,m471,LISA,"Don't know, Joe."
237607,L440900,u7042,m471,JOE,"Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: ""I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"""
237608,L440899,u7046,m471,LISA,That's perfectly clear.
237609,L440898,u7042,m471,JOE,"And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you."
237610,L440897,u7046,m471,LISA,"Fine, Joe."
237611,L440896,u7042,m471,JOE,"I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? ""Is that mine? I thought it was yours."" Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is."
237612,L440895,u7046,m471,LISA,"Okay, Joe..."
237613,L440894,u7042,m471,JOE,Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
237614,L440893,u7046,m471,LISA,Probably since she was born.
237615,L440892,u7042,m471,JOE,Since when?
237616,L440891,u7046,m471,LISA,Duh...
237617,L440890,u7042,m471,JOE,"Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?"
237618,L440889,u7046,m471,LISA,"Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets."
237619,L440888,u7042,m471,JOE,Who?
237620,L440887,u7046,m471,LISA,Lots.
237621,L440886,u7042,m471,JOE,How many do you know?
237622,L440885,u7046,m471,LISA,How many gays do you know?
237623,L440884,u7042,m471,JOE,Not especially.
237624,L440883,u7046,m471,LISA,"You have a problem with gays, Joe."
237625,L440735,u7046,m471,LISA,"Give me the camera, Joe."
237626,L440734,u7042,m471,JOE,"You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!"
237627,L440758,u7042,m471,JOE,"Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in."
237628,L440757,u7048,m471,MRS. FINLEY,Now that you mention it...
237629,L440756,u7042,m471,JOE,"Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?"
237630,L440755,u7048,m471,MRS. FINLEY,Yeah. Do I have a case?
237631,L440749,u7048,m471,MRS. FINLEY,Why should I?
237632,L440748,u7042,m471,JOE,Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
237633,L440747,u7048,m471,MRS. FINLEY,Right.
237634,L441257,u7044,m471,KENTON,"I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own."
237635,L441256,u7042,m471,JOE,"But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?"
237636,L441255,u7044,m471,KENTON,I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
237637,L441254,u7042,m471,JOE,"So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?"
237638,L441253,u7044,m471,KENTON,<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
237639,L441250,u7042,m471,JOE,Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
237640,L441249,u7044,m471,KENTON,"Yes, we did."
237641,L441248,u7042,m471,JOE,You taught him a lesson.
237642,L441247,u7044,m471,KENTON,"We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it."
237643,L441246,u7042,m471,JOE,How did you do that?
237644,L441245,u7044,m471,KENTON,Yeah. But we took care of him.
237645,L441238,u7042,m471,JOE,Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
237646,L441237,u7044,m471,KENTON,Going on... like...?
237647,L441236,u7042,m471,JOE,"So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?"
237648,L441235,u7044,m471,KENTON,Not when I was in the Navy.
237649,L441234,u7042,m471,JOE,Any women on board?
237650,L441233,u7044,m471,KENTON,"Anywhere from two weeks, to several months."
237651,L441038,u7044,m471,KENTON,"A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?"
237652,L441037,u7042,m471,JOE,"Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?"
237653,L441473,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,Beckett?
237654,L441472,u7042,m471,JOE,Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
237655,L441471,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,This would be a good time to break for the day...
237656,L441244,u7042,m471,JOE,"You had one guy ""like that?"""
237657,L441243,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,Let's continue.
237658,L441226,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,"No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection."
237659,L441225,u7042,m471,JOE,"With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?"
237660,L441224,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,"In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation."
237661,L441025,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,"Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I..."
237662,L441024,u7042,m471,JOE,"Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars."
237663,L441016,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,"Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck."
237664,L441015,u7042,m471,JOE,Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
237665,L441014,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,"By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?"
237666,L441013,u7042,m471,JOE,"If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter."
237667,L441005,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,On behalf of the defendants?
237668,L441004,u7042,m471,JOE,"I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor."
237669,L441003,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,"I've seen your television commercials. ""If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, ""through the <u>negligence</u> of others."""
237670,L441002,u7042,m471,JOE,"Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services."
237671,L441001,u7043,m471,JUDGE GARNETT,Attorney for the plaintiff?
237672,L441513,u7044,m471,KENTON,You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
237673,L441512,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it."
237674,L441041,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Andy, you don't want this."
237675,L441040,u7044,m471,KENTON,"You'll be sorry, Beckett."
237676,L440969,u7044,m471,KENTON,"Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?"
237677,L440968,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?"
237678,L440959,u7044,m471,KENTON,We ought to be suing him.
237679,L440958,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic."
237680,L440945,u7044,m471,KENTON,Dr. J.!
237681,L440944,u7052,m471,WHEELER,Julius!
237682,L440810,u7044,m471,KENTON,Helloooo...
237683,L440809,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?"
237684,L440599,u7052,m471,WHEELER,Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
237685,L440598,u7044,m471,KENTON,"It's good to be King, hey Charles?"
237686,L441521,u7052,m471,WHEELER,... It's time to get this society back on track!
237687,L441520,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,... But we shouldn't have fired him...
237688,L441519,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"... But now, we're standing up for ourselves..."
237689,L441518,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to..."
237690,L441497,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy."
237691,L441496,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Charles...
237692,L441495,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too."
237693,L441490,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer."
237694,L441489,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?"
237695,L441488,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"I've discovered something interesting, Charles."
237696,L440965,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say ""I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?"" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God."
237697,L440964,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,He was doing a great job.
237698,L440963,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, ""I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"""
237699,L440962,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,"That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business."
237700,L440957,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
237701,L440956,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!"
237702,L440955,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Charles...
237703,L440954,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?"
237704,L440953,u7051,m471,SEIDMAN,Jesus.
237705,L440952,u7052,m471,WHEELER,"... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?"
237706,L443094,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
237707,L443093,u7054,m472,AUDREY,Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
237708,L443092,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Probably okay to talk to me now.
237709,L443078,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?"
237710,L443077,u7054,m472,AUDREY,You came for us....
237711,L443027,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
237712,L443026,u7054,m472,AUDREY,What? What is it?
237713,L442998,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare."
237714,L442997,u7054,m472,AUDREY,Gonna lose everybody out here....
237715,L442791,u7054,m472,AUDREY,Lookit. Lookit!
237716,L442790,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Don't wanna miss this.
237717,L442848,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot."
237718,L442847,u7054,m472,AUDREY,You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
237719,L442601,u7054,m472,AUDREY,It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
237720,L442600,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Oh, Lord...."
237721,L442595,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what."
237722,L442594,u7054,m472,AUDREY,"Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?"
237723,L442593,u7059,m472,PARIS,Tell me that was you.
237724,L442592,u7054,m472,AUDREY,<u>What</u>?
237725,L442591,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Audrey? Oh, Audrey...."
237726,L443003,u7055,m472,FRY,"Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?"
237727,L443002,u7054,m472,AUDREY,Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
237728,L442987,u7055,m472,FRY,"Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!"
237729,L442986,u7054,m472,AUDREY,What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
237730,L442985,u7055,m472,FRY,Bring the light!
237731,L442929,u7055,m472,FRY,"No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner."
237732,L442928,u7054,m472,AUDREY,I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
237733,L442912,u7054,m472,AUDREY,"Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?"
237734,L442911,u7055,m472,FRY,Bottle-count.
237735,L442486,u7054,m472,AUDREY,"Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me."
237736,L442485,u7055,m472,FRY,Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
237737,L443076,u7055,m472,FRY,"But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them."
237738,L443075,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,You barely know them.
237739,L443074,u7055,m472,FRY,I would try for them.
237740,L443073,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,You'd die for them?
237741,L443071,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn."
237742,L443070,u7055,m472,FRY,But they...they could still be....
237743,L443069,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Just give me your hand.
237744,L443068,u7055,m472,FRY,Don't do this to me....
237745,L443067,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Here. Make it easy on you.
237746,L443066,u7055,m472,FRY,I can't....I can't....
237747,L443065,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Step aboard, Carolyn."
237748,L443064,u7055,m472,FRY,"No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and...."
237749,L443063,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that."
237750,L443062,u7055,m472,FRY,You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
237751,L443061,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,They're already dead. Get on board.
237752,L443060,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
237753,L443059,u7055,m472,FRY,Just come with me!
237754,L443057,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
237755,L443056,u7055,m472,FRY,"<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race."
237756,L443055,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
237757,L443054,u7055,m472,FRY,"What, you're afraid?"
237758,L443053,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
237759,L443052,u7055,m472,FRY,I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
237760,L443051,u7055,m472,FRY,You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
237761,L443050,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
237762,L443039,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,We can't make it.
237763,L443038,u7055,m472,FRY,"Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!"
237764,L443037,u7055,m472,FRY,Riddick? How close?
237765,L443036,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!"
237766,L443020,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,As fast as you can.
237767,L443019,u7055,m472,FRY,You sure you can keep --
237768,L443018,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,As fast as you can.
237769,L443009,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Let's drop back an' boot up.
237770,L443008,u7055,m472,FRY,"We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers."
237771,L443001,u7055,m472,FRY,Audrey?
237772,L443000,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,One or two.
237773,L442999,u7055,m472,FRY,How many you see?
237774,L442993,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
237775,L442992,u7055,m472,FRY,Get out of our way.
237776,L442991,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Back to the ship, huh?"
237777,L442925,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
237778,L442924,u7055,m472,FRY,What about her?
237779,L442921,u7055,m472,FRY,Think about what?
237780,L442920,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
237781,L442919,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,<u>Listen</u>.
237782,L442918,u7055,m472,FRY,Riddick? What the hell are you --
237783,L442910,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
237784,L442909,u7055,m472,FRY,What do you see? Riddick?
237785,L442895,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Saw something I didn't like.
237786,L442894,u7055,m472,FRY,Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
237787,L442891,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
237788,L442890,u7055,m472,FRY,"We can, can't we? Trust you?"
237789,L442889,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
237790,L442888,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
237791,L442887,u7055,m472,FRY,But I just wanted to say --
237792,L442886,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Had it with deals.
237793,L442885,u7055,m472,FRY,"Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --"
237794,L442768,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed."
237795,L442767,u7055,m472,FRY,"Why, what'd you hear?"
237796,L442765,u7055,m472,FRY,"You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?"
237797,L442764,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
237798,L442763,u7055,m472,FRY,Entered our minds.
237799,L442762,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
237800,L442761,u7055,m472,FRY,I got the quick-and-ugly version.
237801,L442760,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape."
237802,L442759,u7055,m472,FRY,They're coming.
237803,L442758,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Power cells.
237804,L442631,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Look deeper.
237805,L442630,u7055,m472,FRY,Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
237806,L442629,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time."
237807,L442628,u7055,m472,FRY,Heard about it. Just never seen it.
237808,L442627,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Slam doctor. Well, we called him ""doctor."""
237809,L442626,u7055,m472,FRY,You did this? To yourself?
237810,L442624,u7055,m472,FRY,Show me your eyes.
237811,L442623,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now."
237812,L442621,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight."
237813,L442620,u7055,m472,FRY,What whispers?
237814,L442619,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,'Mean the whispers?
237815,L442618,u7055,m472,FRY,"Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull."
237816,L442901,u7059,m472,PARIS,"I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --"
237817,L442900,u7055,m472,FRY,"What, switch what?"
237818,L442899,u7059,m472,PARIS,Can we switch?
237819,L442898,u7055,m472,FRY,Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
237820,L442846,u7055,m472,FRY,We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
237821,L442845,u7059,m472,PARIS,"I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night."
237822,L442841,u7055,m472,FRY,Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
237823,L442840,u7059,m472,PARIS,Possibly.
237824,L442839,u7055,m472,FRY,"Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?"
237825,L442838,u7059,m472,PARIS,Not sure. Ten?
237826,L442837,u7055,m472,FRY,How many bottles?
237827,L442836,u7059,m472,PARIS,Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
237828,L442835,u7055,m472,FRY,"...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more...."
237829,L442832,u7055,m472,FRY,It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
237830,L442831,u7059,m472,PARIS,Like the light is scalding it.
237831,L442830,u7055,m472,FRY,There....
237832,L442819,u7059,m472,PARIS,I know what's in here!
237833,L442818,u7055,m472,FRY,"Christ, you don't know what's out there!"
237834,L442795,u7055,m472,FRY,"Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo."
237835,L442794,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee."
237836,L442786,u7055,m472,FRY,It's starting....
237837,L442785,u7059,m472,PARIS,What do my eyes see?
237838,L442505,u7059,m472,PARIS,"200-year-old single-malt scotch is to ""booze"" as foie gras is to ""duck guts."""
237839,L442504,u7055,m472,FRY,This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
237840,L442951,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?"
237841,L442950,u7055,m472,FRY,We cannot go through there....
237842,L442948,u7055,m472,FRY,Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
237843,L442947,u7057,m472,JOHNS,-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
237844,L442946,u7055,m472,FRY,"Just shut up, okay?"
237845,L442945,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --"
237846,L442944,u7055,m472,FRY,"This does not help us, Johns."
237847,L442939,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --"
237848,L442938,u7055,m472,FRY,Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
237849,L442937,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here."
237850,L442936,u7055,m472,FRY,"I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship."
237851,L442935,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?"
237852,L442915,u7055,m472,FRY,Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
237853,L442914,u7057,m472,JOHNS,We aren't completely stupid.
237854,L442893,u7055,m472,FRY,Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
237855,L442892,u7057,m472,JOHNS,So you noticed too?
237856,L442882,u7055,m472,FRY,"I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us."
237857,L442881,u7057,m472,JOHNS,You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
237858,L442880,u7055,m472,FRY,We're just burnin' light here.
237859,L442879,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?"
237860,L442862,u7055,m472,FRY,"Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan."
237861,L442861,u7057,m472,JOHNS,79 kilos.
237862,L442860,u7055,m472,FRY,How much?
237863,L442859,u7057,m472,JOHNS,What the hell's it matter?
237864,L442858,u7055,m472,FRY,"How much you weigh, Johns?"
237865,L442857,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
237866,L442856,u7055,m472,FRY,For your own fear.
237867,L442855,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Smoke screen for what?
237868,L442854,u7055,m472,FRY,"Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen."
237869,L442853,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?"
237870,L442844,u7055,m472,FRY,"We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock."
237871,L442843,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane."
237872,L442829,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it."
237873,L442828,u7055,m472,FRY,"Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!"
237874,L442783,u7055,m472,FRY,You coulda helped. And you didn't.
237875,L442782,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business."
237876,L442781,u7055,m472,FRY,"Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --"
237877,L442780,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
237878,L442779,u7055,m472,FRY,<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
237879,L442778,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
237880,L442777,u7055,m472,FRY,"And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?"
237881,L442776,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?"
237882,L442775,u7055,m472,FRY,"Never said you were a hype, either."
237883,L442774,u7057,m472,JOHNS,I never said I was.
237884,L442773,u7055,m472,FRY,"You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --"
237885,L442754,u7057,m472,JOHNS,I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
237886,L442753,u7055,m472,FRY,Dancin' on razor blades here...
237887,L442752,u7057,m472,JOHNS,He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
237888,L442751,u7055,m472,FRY,"You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --"
237889,L442750,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch."
237890,L442749,u7055,m472,FRY,"You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over."
237891,L442748,u7057,m472,JOHNS,May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
237892,L442747,u7055,m472,FRY,"Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns."
237893,L442746,u7057,m472,JOHNS,That's what I said.
237894,L442745,u7055,m472,FRY,You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
237895,L442744,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry."
237896,L442743,u7055,m472,FRY,"Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --"
237897,L442742,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down."
237898,L442741,u7055,m472,FRY,He can pilot?
237899,L442739,u7055,m472,FRY,"<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?"
237900,L442738,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --"
237901,L442737,u7055,m472,FRY,Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
237902,L442736,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Let's wait on the power cells.
237903,L442735,u7055,m472,FRY,"...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --"
237904,L442729,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Wha'?
237905,L442728,u7055,m472,FRY,60 years ago.
237906,L442727,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --"
237907,L442712,u7055,m472,FRY,"So what happened? Where are they, then?"
237908,L442711,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --"
237909,L442690,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"25 kilos each, huh?"
237910,L442689,u7055,m472,FRY,"15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch."
237911,L442688,u7057,m472,JOHNS,How many?
237912,L442687,u7055,m472,FRY,"Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells."
237913,L442682,u7055,m472,FRY,Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
237914,L442681,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Little ratty-ass.
237915,L442644,u7055,m472,FRY,"Thanks for the tip, Johns."
237916,L442643,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another."
237917,L442642,u7055,m472,FRY,"What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?"
237918,L442641,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
237919,L442640,u7055,m472,FRY,"Nobody else is going down but me, okay?"
237920,L442638,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --"
237921,L442637,u7055,m472,FRY,Thought you didn't believe his story.
237922,L442636,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Well, don't ask me to."
237923,L442635,u7055,m472,FRY,"<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it."
237924,L442634,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --"
237925,L442633,u7055,m472,FRY,Let's just be sure.
237926,L442632,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --"
237927,L442616,u7057,m472,JOHNS,I assume he licked it clean.
237928,L442615,u7055,m472,FRY,So why isn't it all bloody?
237929,L442614,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
237930,L442613,u7055,m472,FRY,He used that?
237931,L442611,u7055,m472,FRY,"Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what...."
237932,L442610,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie...."
237933,L442607,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Like my pistola.
237934,L442606,u7055,m472,FRY,Like what?
237935,L442605,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Sorry. Thought I heard something.
237936,L442604,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Shut up.
237937,L442603,u7055,m472,FRY,"No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --"
237938,L442572,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
237939,L442571,u7055,m472,FRY,What?
237940,L442570,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Didn't bite.
237941,L442568,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
237942,L442567,u7055,m472,FRY,So now you know.
237943,L442566,u7055,m472,FRY,During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
237944,L442565,u7057,m472,JOHNS,You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
237945,L442564,u7055,m472,FRY,Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
237946,L442563,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn."
237947,L442562,u7057,m472,JOHNS,What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
237948,L442561,u7055,m472,FRY,Better keep moving....
237949,L442560,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"So I noticed. Never seen a ""captain"" quite so ready to leave her ship."
237950,L442559,u7055,m472,FRY,"No, no, I wanted to get away."
237951,L442557,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Probably right.
237952,L442556,u7055,m472,FRY,Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
237953,L442543,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Tell me it's not a mirage.
237954,L442542,u7055,m472,FRY,What?
237955,L442533,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Which means he went toward sunrise.
237956,L442532,u7055,m472,FRY,Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
237957,L442531,u7057,m472,JOHNS,A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
237958,L442501,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
237959,L442500,u7055,m472,FRY,S'matter?
237960,L442495,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Only around humans.
237961,L442494,u7055,m472,FRY,I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
237962,L442493,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
237963,L442492,u7055,m472,FRY,We just keep him locked up forever?
237964,L442491,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Big Evil?
237965,L442490,u7055,m472,FRY,And him?
237966,L442464,u7055,m472,FRY,"Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but..."
237967,L442463,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Amazing. I'm Johns.
237968,L442462,u7055,m472,FRY,"Hey, me. Over here."
237969,L442461,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Hey, who?"
237970,L442460,u7055,m472,FRY,Hey.
237971,L442523,u7055,m472,FRY,"Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad."
237972,L442522,u7062,m472,ZEKE,"What, you're goin' off, too?"
237973,L442521,u7055,m472,FRY,Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
237974,L442498,u7055,m472,FRY,Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
237975,L442497,u7062,m472,ZEKE,Well? Is it just the pump?
237976,L442483,u7055,m472,FRY,Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
237977,L442482,u7062,m472,ZEKE,"So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?"
237978,L442481,u7055,m472,FRY,"It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --"
237979,L442456,u7058,m472,OWENS,70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
237980,L442455,u7055,m472,FRY,Owens!
237981,L442452,u7055,m472,FRY,And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
237982,L442451,u7058,m472,OWENS,"When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --"
237983,L442450,u7055,m472,FRY,"Company's not here, is it?"
237984,L442449,u7058,m472,OWENS,"Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --"
237985,L442447,u7055,m472,FRY,"So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?"
237986,L442446,u7058,m472,OWENS,"You mean that ""load"" of passengers?"
237987,L442445,u7055,m472,FRY,Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
237988,L442444,u7058,m472,OWENS,Fry?
237989,L442438,u7058,m472,OWENS,"Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space...."
237990,L442437,u7055,m472,FRY,"1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us."
237991,L442435,u7058,m472,OWENS,"Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?"
237992,L442434,u7055,m472,FRY,You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
237993,L442433,u7058,m472,OWENS,"I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?"
237994,L442432,u7055,m472,FRY,"He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --"
237995,L442431,u7058,m472,OWENS,Why did I fall on you?
237996,L443035,u7056,m472,IMAM,Rain.
237997,L443034,u7055,m472,FRY,"Oh, no. No, no, no...."
237998,L443006,u7055,m472,FRY,And what about the cells?
237999,L443005,u7056,m472,IMAM,The sled as a shield....
238000,L442974,u7055,m472,FRY,Do what I say. Please.
238001,L442973,u7056,m472,IMAM,I would rather we all stay--
238002,L442972,u7055,m472,FRY,"Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them."
238003,L442971,u7056,m472,IMAM,What?
238004,L442970,u7055,m472,FRY,Imam. Slow down.
238005,L442870,u7055,m472,FRY,"No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can."
238006,L442869,u7056,m472,IMAM,And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
238007,L442868,u7055,m472,FRY,They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
238008,L442826,u7055,m472,FRY,Riddick?
238009,L442825,u7056,m472,IMAM,Hasan?
238010,L442803,u7056,m472,IMAM,"Quiet, please. Everyone."
238011,L442802,u7055,m472,FRY,I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
238012,L442655,u7055,m472,FRY,For now.
238013,L442654,u7056,m472,IMAM,One is all?
238014,L442541,u7056,m472,IMAM,We're all on the same hajj now.
238015,L442540,u7055,m472,FRY,Frightening thought.
238016,L442539,u7056,m472,IMAM,"Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well."
238017,L442538,u7055,m472,FRY,You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
238018,L442537,u7056,m472,IMAM,"""Some prophet guy."" And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God."
238019,L442536,u7055,m472,FRY,Some prophet guy?
238020,L442535,u7056,m472,IMAM,You know who Muhammad was?
238021,L442534,u7055,m472,FRY,"So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then...."
238022,L442510,u7056,m472,IMAM,One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
238023,L442509,u7055,m472,FRY,I don't suppose....
238024,L443098,u7056,m472,IMAM,"It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick."
238025,L443097,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
238026,L443096,u7056,m472,IMAM,New Mecca....
238027,L443033,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
238028,L443032,u7056,m472,IMAM,SULEIMAN!
238029,L443031,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Get the girl back under. Keep going.
238030,L443030,u7056,m472,IMAM,Suleiman!
238031,L443017,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
238032,L443016,u7056,m472,IMAM,He will be with us. Nonetheless.
238033,L443015,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker."
238034,L443014,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,You <u>don't</u> see.
238035,L443013,u7056,m472,IMAM,"I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --"
238036,L443012,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,And pointless.
238037,L443011,u7056,m472,IMAM,Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
238038,L443010,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,What're you doin'?
238039,L442996,u7056,m472,IMAM,You mean....
238040,L442995,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Which half?
238041,L442994,u7056,m472,IMAM,Where's Mr. Johns?
238042,L442933,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"There is no ""safe."""
238043,L442932,u7056,m472,IMAM,"Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --"
238044,L442714,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Has anyone checked the coring room?
238045,L442713,u7056,m472,IMAM,Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
238046,L442941,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
238047,L442940,u7056,m472,IMAM,"She's the captain, we should listen to --"
238048,L442917,u7057,m472,JOHNS,He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
238049,L442916,u7056,m472,IMAM,We crossed our own tracks.
238050,L442867,u7056,m472,IMAM,Please...this solves nothing...please....
238051,L442866,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this."
238052,L442851,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then."
238053,L442850,u7056,m472,IMAM,I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
238054,L442651,u7056,m472,IMAM,The child heard you before any of us could even....
238055,L442650,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now...."
238056,L442584,u7057,m472,JOHNS,I'm born-again.
238057,L442583,u7056,m472,IMAM,"""God is Great,"" yes?"
238058,L442512,u7056,m472,IMAM,"All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there."
238059,L442511,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?"
238060,L442903,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Oh, so I'm disposable?"
238061,L442902,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells."
238062,L442817,u7059,m472,PARIS,Not staying in here another....
238063,L442816,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Very big beads.
238064,L442704,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Like an emergency life-raft, right?"
238065,L442703,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really."
238066,L442670,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
238067,L442669,u7059,m472,PARIS,So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
238068,L442515,u7059,m472,PARIS,Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
238069,L442514,u7057,m472,JOHNS,What the hell are these?
238070,L442507,u7059,m472,PARIS,I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
238071,L442506,u7057,m472,JOHNS,A toast to whatever he just said.
238072,L442503,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare."
238073,L442502,u7057,m472,JOHNS,King Tut's tomb....
238074,L442477,u7059,m472,PARIS,Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
238075,L442476,u7057,m472,JOHNS,...then we saw this.
238076,L442984,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Like who, Mr. Chrislam?"
238077,L442983,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
238078,L442982,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples."
238079,L442980,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you."
238080,L442979,u7057,m472,JOHNS,What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
238081,L442978,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?"
238082,L442977,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv."
238083,L442976,u7057,m472,JOHNS,What do you care?
238084,L442975,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"What's her name, anyway?"
238085,L442969,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Don' look, don' look, don' look...."
238086,L442968,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,So which one caught your eye?
238087,L442967,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
238088,L442966,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Nice embellishment.
238089,L442965,u7057,m472,JOHNS,<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
238090,L442964,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum."
238091,L442963,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto."
238092,L442962,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Kept calling it ""murder"" when I did it."
238093,L442961,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called ""triage,"" okay?"
238094,L442958,u7057,m472,JOHNS,What if you're one of five?
238095,L442957,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Not if I'm the one.
238096,L442956,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?"
238097,L442955,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Just realized that, huh?"
238098,L442954,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Ain't all of us gonna make it.
238099,L442931,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
238100,L442930,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Aw, this can't be happening to me...."
238101,L442927,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,No. She's not.
238102,L442926,u7057,m472,JOHNS,What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
238103,L442923,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,About the girl.
238104,L442922,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!"
238105,L442897,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?"
238106,L442896,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Such as.
238107,L442876,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Looks clear.
238108,L442875,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Well, what's it look like now?"
238109,L442874,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Said ""looks clear."""
238110,L442873,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"<u>Fuck me</u>. You said ""clear."""
238111,L442865,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,How 'bout a cut in your gut?
238112,L442864,u7057,m472,JOHNS,I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
238113,L442863,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Think about that reward, Johns."
238114,L442810,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Wanna rag your fat mouth?
238115,L442809,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Well, you got the big gauge."
238116,L442808,u7057,m472,JOHNS,I'd rather piss glass.
238117,L442734,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Not afraid of the dark, are you?"
238118,L442733,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Are you fuckin' kidding me?
238119,L442667,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?"
238120,L442666,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you."
238121,L442665,u7057,m472,JOHNS,Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
238122,L442664,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"You'd cut me loose, Boss?"
238123,L442663,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me."
238124,L442662,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
238125,L442661,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock...."
238126,L442660,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Say that again.
238127,L442659,u7057,m472,JOHNS,"Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't."
238128,L442657,u7057,m472,JOHNS,We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
238129,L442656,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Found somethin' worse than me, huh?"
238130,L442547,u7062,m472,ZEKE,"Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse."
238131,L442546,u7059,m472,PARIS,Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
238132,L442529,u7059,m472,PARIS,So much for my cocktail hour.
238133,L442528,u7062,m472,ZEKE,So much for your nightfall.
238134,L442519,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?"
238135,L442518,u7062,m472,ZEKE,"'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess."
238136,L442517,u7059,m472,PARIS,"Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct."
238137,L442516,u7062,m472,ZEKE,An' this?
238138,L442726,u7061,m472,SHAZZA,"Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it."
238139,L442725,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"What, it's broken?"
238140,L442724,u7061,m472,SHAZZA,Take it.
238141,L442723,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
238142,L442722,u7061,m472,SHAZZA,You were tryin' to kill him too.
238143,L442710,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
238144,L442709,u7061,m472,SHAZZA,"Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know."
238145,L442708,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?"
238146,L442684,u7060,m472,RIDDICK,"Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?"
238147,L442683,u7061,m472,SHAZZA,Not a star-jumper.
238148,L443797,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
238149,L443796,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Seal the cave?
238150,L443714,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
238151,L443713,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"No sir, I haven't forgotten."
238152,L443712,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'"
238153,L443711,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
238154,L443702,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations."
238155,L443701,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,I apologize.
238156,L443700,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
238157,L443699,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ..."
238158,L443678,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
238159,L443677,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts."
238160,L443676,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason."
238161,L443674,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
238162,L443673,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,How did you know we'd come here?
238163,L443520,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ..."
238164,L443519,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
238165,L443377,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again."
238166,L443376,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?"
238167,L443375,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes."
238168,L443374,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?"
238169,L443373,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Dr. Zaius --
238170,L443319,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over."
238171,L443318,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail."
238172,L443774,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Good luck then.
238173,L443773,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
238174,L443751,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have."
238175,L443750,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
238176,L443718,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
238177,L443717,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,What are you doing there?
238178,L443716,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours."
238179,L443685,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
238180,L443684,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Taylor, I'd rather you -"
238181,L443670,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Shut up.
238182,L443669,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun."
238183,L443668,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it."
238184,L443662,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Right now, if you like."
238185,L443661,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
238186,L443651,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
238187,L443650,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
238188,L443647,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
238189,L443646,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Where does the river lead?
238190,L443625,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there."
238191,L443624,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing."
238192,L443623,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
238193,L443622,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
238194,L443621,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"You still don't believe me, do you?"
238195,L443620,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours."
238196,L443617,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
238197,L443616,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,As you wish.
238198,L443613,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Just the same, I want one."
238199,L443612,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,The best. But we won't need them.
238200,L443611,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Do you have any weapons?
238201,L443610,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now."
238202,L443631,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
238203,L443630,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least."
238204,L443607,u7074,m473,ZIRA,There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
238205,L443606,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,How did it go?
238206,L443390,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Zira....
238207,L443389,u7074,m473,ZIRA,A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
238208,L443372,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --"
238209,L443371,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!"
238210,L443370,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle."
238211,L443369,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Well, maybe they're not."
238212,L443368,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment."
238213,L443367,u7074,m473,ZIRA,'I am not a missing link.'
238214,L443365,u7074,m473,ZIRA,How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
238215,L443364,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
238216,L443363,u7074,m473,ZIRA,You didn't think so then.
238217,L443362,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,The evidence was very meager --
238218,L443361,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -"
238219,L443360,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,It's probably wrong --
238220,L443359,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
238221,L443358,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"No, they won't -"
238222,L443357,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it."
238223,L443356,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?"
238224,L443355,u7074,m473,ZIRA,But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
238225,L443354,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,I don't. And I'm not going to try.
238226,L443353,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"'Then how do you account for me?,"
238227,L443352,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
238228,L443351,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?"
238229,L443345,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?"
238230,L443344,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Flight is a scientific impossibility.
238231,L443342,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,And they fell out of the sky with you?
238232,L443341,u7074,m473,ZIRA,'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
238233,L443340,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Oh, Cornelius, be quiet."
238234,L443339,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Now, just a minute --"
238235,L443335,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Where did you learn to do this?
238236,L443334,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?"
238237,L443333,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
238238,L443308,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,"Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One."
238239,L443307,u7074,m473,ZIRA,The blood transfusion.
238240,L443306,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Remembers what?
238241,L443305,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Look -- she remembers.
238242,L443304,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?"
238243,L443303,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,What's so special about him?
238244,L443302,u7074,m473,ZIRA,That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
238245,L443301,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Neither do I.
238246,L443300,u7074,m473,ZIRA,No.
238247,L443299,u7063,m473,CORNELIUS,Do you have to work tonight?
238248,L443218,u7064,m473,DODGE,Blessed are the vegetarians.
238249,L443217,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us."
238250,L443191,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Let's find them all.
238251,L443190,u7064,m473,DODGE,Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
238252,L443172,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree."
238253,L443171,u7064,m473,DODGE,Taylor -- quit riding him.
238254,L443162,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,None at all.
238255,L443161,u7064,m473,DODGE,Any particular reason?
238256,L443160,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,That way.
238257,L443159,u7064,m473,DODGE,Which direction?
238258,L443158,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out."
238259,L443157,u7064,m473,DODGE,No.
238260,L443156,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Any sign of dangerous ionization?
238261,L443155,u7064,m473,DODGE,"Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates."
238262,L443142,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
238263,L443141,u7064,m473,DODGE,But how long is a day?
238264,L443140,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
238265,L443139,u7064,m473,DODGE,Yo!
238266,L443138,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Geiger counter?
238267,L443137,u7064,m473,DODGE,Yo!
238268,L443136,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Got your sensors?
238269,L443245,u7065,m473,GALEN,They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
238270,L443244,u7074,m473,ZIRA,The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
238271,L443243,u7065,m473,GALEN,Hmph.
238272,L443242,u7074,m473,ZIRA,That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
238273,L443241,u7065,m473,GALEN,You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
238274,L443240,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority."
238275,L443239,u7065,m473,GALEN,But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
238276,L443234,u7065,m473,GALEN,"These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?"
238277,L443233,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"This place is dirty, doctor."
238278,L443230,u7065,m473,GALEN,I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
238279,L443229,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Will he live?
238280,L443228,u7065,m473,GALEN,Him.
238281,L443227,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
238282,L443539,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
238283,L443538,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy."
238284,L443528,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Sustained.
238285,L443527,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,Objection!
238286,L443522,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
238287,L443521,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
238288,L443499,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
238289,L443498,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater."
238290,L443473,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
238291,L443472,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination."
238292,L443468,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ..."
238293,L443467,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,"Come to the point, Dr. Honorius."
238294,L443466,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
238295,L443464,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet."
238296,L443463,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,"State your case, Mr. Prosecutor."
238297,L443448,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,"Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?"
238298,L443447,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law."
238299,L443479,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Show this to the President.
238300,L443478,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?"
238301,L443477,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others."
238302,L443476,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
238303,L443475,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"I admit, I know nothing of your culture."
238304,L443474,u7066,m473,HONORIUS,"Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?"
238305,L443331,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Do as I say.
238306,L443330,u7067,m473,JULIUS,"He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules."
238307,L443329,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
238308,L443324,u7067,m473,JULIUS,I'll see.
238309,L443323,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
238310,L443322,u7067,m473,JULIUS,What happened?
238311,L443266,u7067,m473,JULIUS,"Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do."
238312,L443265,u7074,m473,ZIRA,He's trying to form words.
238313,L443264,u7067,m473,JULIUS,Huh?
238314,L443263,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Did you see that? It's remarkable!
238315,L443261,u7067,m473,JULIUS,See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
238316,L443260,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?"
238317,L443256,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
238318,L443255,u7067,m473,JULIUS,"You could get hurt doing that, Doctor."
238319,L443252,u7067,m473,JULIUS,"No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act."
238320,L443251,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?"
238321,L443250,u7067,m473,JULIUS,"Good morning, Dr. Zira."
238322,L443220,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet."
238323,L443219,u7068,m473,LANDON,We got off at the wrong stop.
238324,L443209,u7068,m473,LANDON,Try telling them our names.
238325,L443208,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,No cigar.
238326,L443201,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Okay.
238327,L443200,u7068,m473,LANDON,Can we take a dip?
238328,L443197,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Let's take a look.
238329,L443196,u7068,m473,LANDON,Scarecrows?
238330,L443186,u7068,m473,LANDON,I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
238331,L443185,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,But I'm not prepared to die.
238332,L443184,u7068,m473,LANDON,Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
238333,L443183,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Don't bother
238334,L443182,u7068,m473,LANDON,Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
238335,L443181,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?"
238336,L443180,u7068,m473,LANDON,Taylor.	I'm telling you --
238337,L443179,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes."
238338,L443178,u7068,m473,LANDON,"Climb off me, will you!"
238339,L443177,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
238340,L443175,u7068,m473,LANDON,I'm prepared to die.
238341,L443174,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead."
238342,L443173,u7068,m473,LANDON,All right --
238343,L443170,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
238344,L443169,u7068,m473,LANDON,If only we could get a fix.
238345,L443154,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better."
238346,L443153,u7068,m473,LANDON,"Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory."
238347,L443152,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.

238349,L443150,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?"
238350,L443149,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,By our time.  You've turned gray.
238351,L443148,u7068,m473,LANDON,Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
238352,L443147,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
238353,L443146,u7068,m473,LANDON,You don't seem very cut up about it.

238355,L443144,u7068,m473,LANDON,Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
238356,L443143,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Landon! Join the expedition.
238357,L443130,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.

238372,L443761,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
238373,L443738,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,"Yes, I can do that."

238377,L443734,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --

238379,L443694,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Relax. You'll see it all later.

238382,L443659,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.

238384,L443653,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,I'm for that.

238388,L443583,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,I want her.
238389,L443582,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,Zira doesn't want your female.

238392,L443578,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --

238394,L443640,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,To scare off humans?
238395,L443639,u7074,m473,ZIRA,The Hunt Club.

238398,L443591,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,Gorilla hunters ...

238400,L443587,u7069,m473,LUCIUS,He wouldn't leave her.
238401,L443586,u7074,m473,ZIRA,I told you not to bring the other one.

238405,L443443,u7070,m473,MAXIMUS,You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
238406,L443383,u7074,m473,ZIRA,We're -- conducting a new experiment.
238407,L443382,u7070,m473,MAXIMUS,Why special?
238408,L443381,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case."

238411,L443378,u7070,m473,MAXIMUS,What is that?

238415,L443493,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,One is in a museum!
238416,L443462,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
238417,L443461,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
238418,L443460,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
238419,L443459,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,My name is Taylor.
238420,L443458,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
238421,L443532,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Sustain all objections, but face the truth!"
238422,L443531,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Sustained.
238423,L443526,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute."
238424,L443525,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,How so?
238425,L443485,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
238426,L443484,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,This is a joke in very poor taste.
238427,L443483,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
238428,L443482,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."""

238430,L443480,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record."
238431,L443471,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
238432,L443470,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,"Mind your tongue, madame."
238433,L443469,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Thats a lie!
238434,L443454,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
238435,L443453,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,"Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law."
238436,L443442,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry."
238437,L443441,u7071,m473,PRESIDENT,"Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius."
238438,L443790,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find."
238439,L443789,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
238440,L443788,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago."
238441,L443787,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
238442,L443786,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself."
238443,L443785,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?"
238444,L443769,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"No, thanks. I'll take freedom."
238445,L443768,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?"
238446,L443767,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Sure.	In a cage.
238447,L443766,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate."
238448,L443765,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Then there is another jungle?
238449,L443753,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet."
238450,L443752,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?"
238451,L443729,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Cease fire! Withdraw!
238452,L443728,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Tell him to pull back!
238453,L443723,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof."
238454,L443722,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you."
238455,L443691,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Okay.Up to the cave.
238456,L443690,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Of course.
238457,L443689,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
238458,L443688,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Twelve hundred years ago.
238459,L443687,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
238460,L443686,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,What is your proposal?
238461,L443683,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test."
238462,L443682,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
238463,L443667,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
238464,L443666,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Stop right there.
238465,L443566,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!"
238466,L443565,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
238467,L443564,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity."
238468,L443563,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,I don't know.
238469,L443562,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?"
238470,L443561,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?"
238471,L443560,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?"
238472,L443559,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Then you admit --
238473,L443558,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
238474,L443557,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?"
238475,L443556,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Of course.
238476,L443555,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor."
238477,L443554,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
238478,L443553,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
238479,L443552,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?"
238480,L443551,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,What about it?
238481,L443550,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?"
238482,L443549,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system."
238483,L443548,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,You lied. Where is your tribe?
238484,L443547,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
238485,L443546,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you."
238486,L443545,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death."
238487,L443544,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,No.
238488,L443543,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?"
238489,L443542,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,What about me?
238490,L443505,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Identify him, then. Speak to him."

238492,L443503,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?

238494,L443777,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man."

238496,L443775,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye."
238497,L443772,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,It's better than going to prison for heresy.
238498,L443771,u7074,m473,ZIRA,We can't.
238499,L443770,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Would you like to come along?
238500,L443749,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?

238502,L443747,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Why not?
238503,L443746,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way."
238504,L443742,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Taylor, you can't."
238505,L443741,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
238506,L443710,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
238507,L443709,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Taylor! Tell him.
238508,L443681,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
238509,L443680,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Taylor, please --"
238510,L443679,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
238511,L443655,u7074,m473,ZIRA,She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
238512,L443654,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?"
238513,L443637,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate."
238514,L443636,u7074,m473,ZIRA,You want her that much?
238515,L443635,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Maybe not.
238516,L443634,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve."

238518,L443632,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Are you going to take her with you?
238519,L443619,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
238520,L443618,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal."
238521,L443590,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
238522,L443589,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Listen-
238523,L443510,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
238524,L443509,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"No, I swear -- I never saw this man before."
238525,L443508,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,You! ... You knew about this?
238526,L443502,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,Second from the left.

238533,L443281,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!"
238534,L443280,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
238535,L443278,u7074,m473,ZIRA,There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
238536,L443277,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
238537,L443276,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
238538,L443259,u7072,m473,TAYLOR,"Listen, listen -- I can speak --"
238539,L443258,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?"
238540,L443799,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
238541,L443798,u7074,m473,ZIRA,But the proof? The doll?
238542,L443764,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you."
238543,L443763,u7074,m473,ZIRA,But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
238544,L443706,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,What?
238545,L443705,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"But there's the doll, sir."
238546,L443704,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?"
238547,L443524,u7074,m473,ZIRA,Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
238548,L443523,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk."
238549,L443497,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes."
238550,L443496,u7074,m473,ZIRA,He doesn't know.
238551,L443495,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,"How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?"
238552,L443492,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Where are they now?
238553,L443491,u7074,m473,ZIRA,This is his assertion.
238554,L443490,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
238555,L443489,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Like you, I find it difficult."
238556,L443488,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Do you believe him?
238557,L443487,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does."
238558,L443486,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
238559,L443385,u7074,m473,ZIRA,"Yes, Sir."
238560,L443384,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
238561,L443288,u7074,m473,ZIRA,But perhaps he understood --
238562,L443287,u7073,m473,ZAIUS,Of course. He saw you moving yours.
238563,L443286,u7074,m473,ZIRA,He's moving his fingers!

238698,L446167,u7078,m474,CHRIS,"Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit."

238750,L445871,u7080,m474,ELIAS,"Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps."

238793,L446558,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?"
238794,L446557,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Just drunk enough.
238795,L446556,u7088,m475,BETTY,I think you're drunk.
238796,L446554,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Maybe you're going to have to like me.
238797,L446553,u7088,m475,BETTY,"I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you."
238798,L446552,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,How careful should I be?
238799,L446551,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell."
238800,L446550,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Why certainly, baby."
238801,L446549,u7088,m475,BETTY,I think I'd like to dance.
238802,L446546,u7088,m475,BETTY,How do you do?
238803,L446545,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield."
238804,L446446,u7088,m475,BETTY,If I change my mind.
238805,L446445,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz."
238806,L446444,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Okay. You win.
238807,L446443,u7088,m475,BETTY,Would you mind?
238808,L446442,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Don't I even get my face slapped?
238809,L446441,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
238810,L446440,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"The brush-off, huh?"
238811,L446438,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
238812,L446437,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash."
238813,L446436,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
238814,L446435,u7088,m475,BETTY,I haven't been invited.
238815,L446434,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there."
238816,L446433,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm sure you have.
238817,L446432,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,We have some nice places around Vancouver.
238818,L446431,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
238819,L446430,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,What's the matter?
238820,L446429,u7088,m475,BETTY,Not tonight.
238821,L446428,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
238822,L446427,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know."
238823,L446426,u7088,m475,BETTY,
238824,L446425,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
238825,L446424,u7088,m475,BETTY,Yes?
238826,L446423,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
238827,L446422,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something."
238828,L446421,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm supposing.
238829,L446420,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
238830,L446419,u7088,m475,BETTY,Thank you.
238831,L446418,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,No thanks?
238832,L446417,u7088,m475,BETTY,Very nice Mitchell turns.
238833,L446416,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
238834,L446350,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,You don't know.
238835,L446349,u7088,m475,BETTY,I don't know.
238836,L446348,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Indefinitely?
238837,L446347,u7088,m475,BETTY,I really don't know.
238838,L446346,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
238839,L446345,u7088,m475,BETTY,Well..
238840,L446344,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I'll make one for you.  I live there.
238841,L446343,u7088,m475,BETTY,Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
238842,L446342,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
238843,L446341,u7088,m475,BETTY,Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
238844,L446340,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard."
238845,L446309,u7088,m475,BETTY,"I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell."
238846,L446308,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Vancouver, B.C."
238847,L446307,u7088,m475,BETTY,How far does this train go?
238848,L446306,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
238849,L446305,u7088,m475,BETTY,"I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell."
238850,L446304,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
238851,L446303,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
238852,L446302,u7088,m475,BETTY,"No thanks, I've seen Seattle."
238853,L446618,u7102,m475,PORTER,"Possibly, Miss."
238854,L446617,u7088,m475,BETTY,They might think I was running away from something.
238855,L446616,u7102,m475,PORTER,"Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think..."
238856,L446615,u7088,m475,BETTY,Immigration Officer?
238857,L446614,u7102,m475,PORTER,"Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer..."
238858,L446613,u7088,m475,BETTY,How long would that take?
238859,L446612,u7102,m475,PORTER,"I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane."
238860,L446611,u7088,m475,BETTY,How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
238861,L446610,u7102,m475,PORTER,"Good evening, Miss."
238862,L446873,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
238863,L446872,u7098,m475,MANAGER,"Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time."
238864,L446871,u7088,m475,BETTY,Bank?
238865,L446870,u7098,m475,MANAGER,"I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank."
238866,L446869,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
238867,L446868,u7098,m475,MANAGER,Good morning. Can I do something for you?
238868,L447454,u7089,m475,BRANDON,If I did-I don't-now.
238869,L447453,u7088,m475,BETTY,Do you think I was faking?
238870,L447452,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I think you mean that.
238871,L447447,u7088,m475,BETTY,Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
238872,L447446,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Me?
238873,L447445,u7088,m475,BETTY,"If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you."
238874,L447444,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog."
238875,L447438,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
238876,L447437,u7088,m475,BETTY,Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
238877,L447436,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Would I want to?
238878,L447435,u7088,m475,BETTY,"But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me."
238879,L447434,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
238880,L447433,u7088,m475,BETTY,Magruder does.
238881,L447432,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?"
238882,L447431,u7088,m475,BETTY,And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
238883,L447430,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Mitchell was dead enough.
238884,L447429,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore."
238885,L447428,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Mine?
238886,L447427,u7088,m475,BETTY,And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
238887,L447426,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now."
238888,L447424,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since."
238889,L447423,u7088,m475,BETTY,You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
238890,L447376,u7088,m475,BETTY,So that I will never be found.
238891,L447375,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place."
238892,L447374,u7088,m475,BETTY,I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
238893,L447373,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
238894,L447372,u7088,m475,BETTY,You-killed-him?
238895,L447371,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
238896,L447370,u7088,m475,BETTY,He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
238897,L447369,u7089,m475,BRANDON,No.  I paid him off.
238898,L447368,u7088,m475,BETTY,"That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?"
238899,L447367,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"It buys things, just like any other kind."
238900,L447366,u7088,m475,BETTY,"The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?"
238901,L447365,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?"
238902,L447364,u7088,m475,BETTY,What your father did doesn't condemn you.
238903,L447363,u7089,m475,BRANDON,So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
238904,L447362,u7088,m475,BETTY,"If it was an accident, you could have told the truth."
238905,L447361,u7089,m475,BRANDON,In a way.
238906,L447360,u7088,m475,BETTY,Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
238907,L447359,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
238908,L447358,u7088,m475,BETTY,Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
238909,L447357,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Including Killaine.
238910,L447356,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you."
238911,L447354,u7089,m475,BRANDON,That's right.
238912,L447353,u7088,m475,BETTY,I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
238913,L447352,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"That, and the fun of it."
238914,L447351,u7088,m475,BETTY,If you're doing all this just for me.
238915,L447350,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Wonder what?
238916,L447349,u7088,m475,BETTY,I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
238917,L447347,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now."
238918,L447346,u7088,m475,BETTY,Frozen.
238919,L447345,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Cold?
238920,L447344,u7089,m475,BRANDON,There would be a moon tonight.
238921,L447343,u7088,m475,BETTY,I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
238922,L447342,u7089,m475,BRANDON,See anything?
238923,L447283,u7088,m475,BETTY,Killaine's wise to what?
238924,L447282,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when."
238925,L447271,u7088,m475,BETTY,You leave it.
238926,L447270,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Well?
238927,L447269,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am."
238928,L447268,u7088,m475,BETTY,You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
238929,L447267,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
238930,L447266,u7089,m475,BRANDON,It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
238931,L447265,u7088,m475,BETTY,Do you have to leave the note?
238932,L447264,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway."
238933,L447263,u7088,m475,BETTY,This must have cost a fortune.
238934,L447262,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
238935,L447244,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby."
238936,L447243,u7088,m475,BETTY,Killaine...
238937,L447242,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis."
238938,L447241,u7088,m475,BETTY,But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
238939,L447240,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance."
238940,L447239,u7088,m475,BETTY,And Betty Mayfield--
238941,L447238,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man."
238942,L447237,u7088,m475,BETTY,They'll look for you.
238943,L447236,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere?"
238944,L447235,u7088,m475,BETTY,"I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--"
238945,L447234,u7089,m475,BRANDON,How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
238946,L447233,u7088,m475,BETTY,Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
238947,L447232,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?"
238948,L447231,u7089,m475,BRANDON,How bad is it?  Bad enough for--
238949,L447230,u7088,m475,BETTY,That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
238950,L447229,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me."
238951,L447228,u7088,m475,BETTY,Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
238952,L447227,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?"
238953,L447225,u7088,m475,BETTY,"I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please."
238954,L447224,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
238955,L447223,u7088,m475,BETTY,They're going to arrest me.
238956,L447222,u7089,m475,BRANDON,No percentage in that.
238957,L447221,u7088,m475,BETTY,I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
238958,L447192,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting."
238959,L447191,u7088,m475,BETTY,There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
238960,L447190,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
238961,L447189,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
238962,L447188,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
238963,L447187,u7089,m475,BRANDON,It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
238964,L446867,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"From you, I like it."
238965,L446866,u7088,m475,BETTY,So have I.
238966,L446865,u7089,m475,BRANDON,That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
238967,L446864,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"No use waiting, then."
238968,L446863,u7088,m475,BETTY,Nothing matters.
238969,L446862,u7089,m475,BRANDON,It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
238970,L446861,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Try not talking.
238971,L446860,u7088,m475,BETTY,Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
238972,L446859,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Anything I can do about it?
238973,L446858,u7088,m475,BETTY,No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
238974,L446857,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Why?
238975,L446856,u7088,m475,BETTY,All right--following me.
238976,L446855,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Us?
238977,L446854,u7088,m475,BETTY,He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
238978,L446853,u7089,m475,BRANDON,He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
238979,L446852,u7088,m475,BETTY,You don't know who he is?
238980,L446851,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it."
238981,L446836,u7089,m475,BRANDON,We'll find out.
238982,L446835,u7088,m475,BETTY,Absolutely sure.
238983,L446834,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
238984,L446832,u7088,m475,BETTY,Then he's--
238985,L446831,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Couldn't be.
238986,L446830,u7088,m475,BETTY,Then he's got to be a detective.
238987,L446829,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
238988,L446828,u7088,m475,BETTY,We walked right passed him. He's following us.
238989,L446827,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I didn't notice him.
238990,L446826,u7088,m475,BETTY,That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
238991,L446824,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it."
238992,L446823,u7088,m475,BETTY,They know you here--know your name.
238993,L446822,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Why not?
238994,L446821,u7088,m475,BETTY,Dance? Here?
238995,L446820,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Want to dance?
238996,L446810,u7089,m475,BRANDON,At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
238997,L446809,u7088,m475,BETTY,Is this the best you can do?
238998,L446808,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Cold?
238999,L446802,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I'm different. I like it fine.
239000,L446801,u7088,m475,BETTY,"You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it."
239001,L446800,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Just who are you, anyway?"
239002,L446799,u7088,m475,BETTY,Certainly not to me.
239003,L446798,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
239004,L446797,u7088,m475,BETTY,Dance? Tonight?
239005,L446796,u7089,m475,BRANDON,So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
239006,L446795,u7088,m475,BETTY,There's a lot of night left to live through.
239007,L446794,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Quarter after one. Why?
239008,L446793,u7088,m475,BETTY,What time is it?
239009,L446792,u7088,m475,BETTY,That's putting it mildly.
239010,L446791,u7089,m475,BRANDON,He could hardly help suspecting you.
239011,L446790,u7088,m475,BETTY,Bad enough.
239012,L446789,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Bad?
239013,L446786,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You didn't have to tell him that.
239014,L446785,u7088,m475,BETTY,There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
239015,L446657,u7088,m475,BETTY,No thanks.
239016,L446656,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Want a spike in it?
239017,L446655,u7089,m475,BRANDON,It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
239018,L446654,u7088,m475,BETTY,There wasn't any plane.
239019,L446653,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You tried to run away.
239020,L446652,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I'd rather wait until it does matter.
239021,L446651,u7088,m475,BETTY,Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
239022,L446649,u7088,m475,BETTY,That's all there is.
239023,L446648,u7089,m475,BRANDON,He was a great boy for that. What else?
239024,L446647,u7088,m475,BETTY,He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
239025,L446646,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Nice of him.
239026,L446645,u7088,m475,BETTY,"On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me."
239027,L446644,u7089,m475,BRANDON,How did you meet him?
239028,L446643,u7088,m475,BETTY,I don't.
239029,L446642,u7089,m475,BRANDON,They'll know whether he killed himself.
239030,L446640,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Sure... but somebody always does..
239031,L446639,u7088,m475,BETTY,"No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?"
239032,L446637,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything."
239033,L446636,u7089,m475,BRANDON,He got in here how?
239034,L446635,u7088,m475,BETTY,"There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there."
239035,L446632,u7088,m475,BETTY,There's one less tonight.
239036,L446631,u7089,m475,BRANDON,What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
239037,L446630,u7088,m475,BETTY,You said it wasn't a tragedy.
239038,L446628,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
239039,L446627,u7088,m475,BETTY,Much too late.
239040,L446626,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I know it's a littler late for an apology.
239041,L446569,u7088,m475,BETTY,No thank you.
239042,L446568,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Dance?
239043,L446488,u7089,m475,BRANDON,He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
239044,L446487,u7088,m475,BETTY,You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
239045,L446486,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
239046,L446485,u7088,m475,BETTY,Do you think I don't?
239047,L446484,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
239048,L446483,u7088,m475,BETTY,I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
239049,L446482,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
239050,L446481,u7088,m475,BETTY,I didn't say anything.
239051,L446480,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Whatever you say.
239052,L446479,u7088,m475,BETTY,Would it make you anymore amusing?
239053,L446478,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself."
239054,L446477,u7088,m475,BETTY,You're drinking it.
239055,L446476,u7089,m475,BRANDON,No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
239056,L446475,u7088,m475,BETTY,And do you amuse the guests?
239057,L446474,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
239058,L446473,u7088,m475,BETTY,You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
239059,L446472,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?"
239060,L446471,u7088,m475,BETTY,As I said before...
239061,L446470,u7089,m475,BRANDON,No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
239062,L446469,u7088,m475,BETTY,You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
239063,L446468,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
239064,L446467,u7088,m475,BETTY,What did you say his name was?
239065,L446466,u7089,m475,BRANDON,It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
239066,L446465,u7088,m475,BETTY,I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
239067,L446464,u7089,m475,BRANDON,It might be worth a Martini to you.
239068,L446463,u7088,m475,BETTY,I see.
239069,L446462,u7089,m475,BRANDON,A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
239070,L446461,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one."
239071,L446460,u7088,m475,BETTY,Your liquor laws..
239072,L446450,u7088,m475,BETTY,I see.
239073,L446449,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
239074,L446448,u7088,m475,BETTY,"No, please."
239075,L446447,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time."
239076,L446459,u7105,m475,WAITER,"Right, Miss."
239077,L446458,u7088,m475,BETTY,Ale. I don't mind.
239078,L446457,u7105,m475,WAITER,"Beer or ale, Miss?"
239079,L446456,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Beer?  Well, all right."
239080,L446455,u7105,m475,WAITER,"Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law."
239081,L446454,u7088,m475,BETTY,"I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please."
239082,L446453,u7105,m475,WAITER,"Yes, Miss."
239083,L447469,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly."
239084,L447468,u7088,m475,BETTY,But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
239085,L447467,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
239086,L447466,u7088,m475,BETTY,"No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer."
239087,L447465,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,We know everything.
239088,L447464,u7088,m475,BETTY,He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
239089,L447092,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Goodbye, Betty."
239090,L447091,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff."
239091,L447090,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Sometimes.
239092,L447089,u7088,m475,BETTY,"You do things the hard way, don't you?"
239093,L447088,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters."
239094,L447087,u7088,m475,BETTY,But even if you were in love with me.
239095,L447086,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I know that.
239096,L447085,u7088,m475,BETTY,What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
239097,L447084,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds."
239098,L447083,u7088,m475,BETTY,What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
239099,L447082,u7088,m475,BETTY,"You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me."
239100,L447081,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
239101,L447080,u7088,m475,BETTY,What will they do to you?
239102,L447079,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I can't answer that.
239103,L447078,u7088,m475,BETTY,To do what?
239104,L447077,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"You've got a couple of hours, maybe."
239105,L447076,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules."
239106,L447075,u7088,m475,BETTY,Because you think your in love with me?
239107,L447074,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
239108,L447073,u7088,m475,BETTY,They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
239109,L447072,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Time's up.  I'm off the case.
239110,L447071,u7088,m475,BETTY,I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
239111,L447070,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it."
239112,L447069,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Looking for peanuts, I suppose."
239113,L447068,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
239114,L447067,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?"
239115,L447066,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,They call me Jeff.
239116,L447065,u7088,m475,BETTY,What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
239117,L447064,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
239118,L447063,u7088,m475,BETTY,Very ridiculous.
239119,L447062,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?"
239120,L447061,u7088,m475,BETTY,What does he see?
239121,L447060,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--"
239122,L447059,u7088,m475,BETTY,Points very straight to her.
239123,L447058,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, ""There goes my lost love""-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl."
239124,L447054,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
239125,L447053,u7088,m475,BETTY,"You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector."
239126,L447052,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
239127,L447051,u7088,m475,BETTY,I expected nothing else.
239128,L447047,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I've come here to arrest you for murder.
239129,L447046,u7088,m475,BETTY,I don't want to talk.
239130,L447045,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,This isn't a very good place to talk.
239131,L446954,u7088,m475,BETTY,There isn't anything you can do.
239132,L446953,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Then there isn't much I can do, is there?"
239133,L446952,u7088,m475,BETTY,You understand perfectly.
239134,L446951,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,If I understand what you meant by that.
239135,L446950,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Nobody can help me. You, least of all."
239136,L446949,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
239137,L446948,u7088,m475,BETTY,"You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl."
239138,L446947,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,We try to be decent.
239139,L446946,u7088,m475,BETTY,You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
239140,L446945,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
239141,L446944,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example."
239142,L446943,u7088,m475,BETTY,"The police always do, don't they?"
239143,L446942,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out."
239144,L446940,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
239145,L446939,u7088,m475,BETTY,You were there when I last saw him.
239146,L446938,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
239147,L446937,u7088,m475,BETTY,Is it a crime?
239148,L446936,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope."
239149,L446935,u7088,m475,BETTY,Who hasn't--one way or another?
239150,L446934,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You've had dealings with the police before?
239151,L446933,u7088,m475,BETTY,"You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known."
239152,L446932,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
239153,L446931,u7088,m475,BETTY,We wouldn't have met at all.
239154,L446930,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield."
239155,L446883,u7088,m475,BETTY,I've never been to Florida.
239156,L446882,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,FLorida?
239157,L446881,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You must come from pretty far South.
239158,L446880,u7088,m475,BETTY,Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
239159,L446879,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue."
239160,L446878,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?"
239161,L446877,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick."
239162,L446782,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
239163,L446781,u7088,m475,BETTY,Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
239164,L446780,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
239165,L446778,u7088,m475,BETTY,A graduation present.
239166,L446777,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Where's you get it?
239167,L446776,u7088,m475,BETTY,Yes.
239168,L446775,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,What this?
239169,L446774,u7088,m475,BETTY,Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
239170,L446773,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets."
239171,L446772,u7088,m475,BETTY,I'm sorry.
239172,L446771,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
239173,L446770,u7088,m475,BETTY,"Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?"
239174,L446766,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
239175,L446765,u7088,m475,BETTY,Who told you I was married?
239176,L446764,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?"
239177,L446738,u7088,m475,BETTY,It is?
239178,L446737,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,That's an evasion and you know it.
239179,L446736,u7088,m475,BETTY,You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
239180,L446735,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Please answer my question.
239181,L446734,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?"
239182,L446733,u7088,m475,BETTY,"I'm sorry, that's all there is."
239183,L446732,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I'll have to know a little more than that.
239184,L446731,u7088,m475,BETTY,I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
239185,L446730,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield."
239186,L446729,u7088,m475,BETTY,I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
239187,L446728,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
239188,L446894,u7089,m475,BRANDON,This way.
239189,L446893,u7103,m475,SECRETARY,"Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon."
239190,L446889,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Who's Goble?
239191,L446888,u7103,m475,SECRETARY,And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
239192,L446887,u7089,m475,BRANDON,All right. Get him.
239193,L446886,u7103,m475,SECRETARY,Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
239194,L446885,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Morning. Any calls?
239195,L446884,u7103,m475,SECRETARY,"Good morning, Mr. Brandon."
239196,L446928,u7093,m475,GOBLE,Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
239197,L446927,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
239198,L446926,u7093,m475,GOBLE,Why not here?
239199,L446925,u7089,m475,BRANDON,There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
239200,L446924,u7093,m475,GOBLE,Get it in half an hour.
239201,L446923,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Got the information on you?
239202,L446922,u7093,m475,GOBLE,Got it on you?
239203,L446921,u7089,m475,BRANDON,A thousand.
239204,L446920,u7093,m475,GOBLE,Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
239205,L446919,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You mentioned information.
239206,L446918,u7093,m475,GOBLE,I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
239207,L446917,u7089,m475,BRANDON,For two hundred?
239208,L446916,u7093,m475,GOBLE,I go home and paint the kitchen.
239209,L446915,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"For five hundred, what do I get?"
239210,L446914,u7093,m475,GOBLE,Bluff. You've waited too long.
239211,L446913,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign."
239212,L446912,u7093,m475,GOBLE,You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
239213,L446911,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
239214,L446910,u7093,m475,GOBLE,"Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic."
239215,L446909,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?"
239216,L446908,u7093,m475,GOBLE,"Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon."
239217,L446907,u7089,m475,BRANDON,What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
239218,L446906,u7093,m475,GOBLE,$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
239219,L446905,u7089,m475,BRANDON,What are your rates?
239220,L446904,u7093,m475,GOBLE,"You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding."
239221,L446903,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Private eye?
239222,L446902,u7093,m475,GOBLE,"Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?"
239223,L446901,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Name it.
239224,L446900,u7093,m475,GOBLE,I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
239225,L446899,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I'm still asking. What do you want?
239226,L446898,u7093,m475,GOBLE,You asked for it.
239227,L446897,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
239228,L446892,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I'm not interested in blind dates.
239229,L446891,u7093,m475,GOBLE,"I'd like a few words with you, in private."
239230,L446668,u7099,m475,MARGO,That comedian?
239231,L446667,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
239232,L446666,u7099,m475,MARGO,I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
239233,L446662,u7099,m475,MARGO,"They still hang women in Canada, I've heard."
239234,L446661,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Leave that one lay.
239235,L446660,u7099,m475,MARGO,And without much discrimination.
239236,L446659,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Sometimes.
239237,L446658,u7099,m475,MARGO,"You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?"
239238,L446524,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"You, Killaine?"
239239,L446523,u7099,m475,MARGO,Martini.
239240,L446522,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"What'll you have, Margo?"
239241,L446521,u7099,m475,MARGO,Fascinated.
239242,L446520,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West."
239243,L446519,u7099,m475,MARGO,In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
239244,L446518,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
239245,L446848,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you."
239246,L446847,u7097,m475,MAN,What's this in favor of?
239247,L446846,u7097,m475,MAN,The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
239248,L446845,u7089,m475,BRANDON,How are your teeth getting along?
239249,L446844,u7097,m475,MAN,I've got good ears.
239250,L446843,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Who told you my name?
239251,L446842,u7097,m475,MAN,"Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?"
239252,L446841,u7089,m475,BRANDON,So you're not a cop.
239253,L446840,u7097,m475,MAN,What's a buzzer?
239254,L446839,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"All right, let's see the buzzer."
239255,L447211,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
239256,L447210,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You asked me where it all came from.
239257,L447209,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,What?
239258,L447208,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I had a father who knew how to steal.
239259,L447207,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
239260,L447206,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
239261,L447205,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
239262,L447204,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
239263,L447203,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?"
239264,L447202,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
239265,L447201,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
239266,L447200,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted."
239267,L447198,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered."
239268,L447197,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law."
239269,L447181,u7089,m475,BRANDON,No idea.
239270,L447180,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
239271,L447179,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine."
239272,L447178,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours."
239273,L447177,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Mitchell was too drunk.
239274,L447176,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
239275,L447175,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?"
239276,L447174,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
239277,L447173,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money."
239278,L447172,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?"
239279,L447171,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
239280,L447170,u7089,m475,BRANDON,That COULD BE TOLD.
239281,L447169,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,It could have been an accident.
239282,L447168,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
239283,L447167,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Information.
239284,L447166,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
239285,L447165,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,The only answer I have for you.
239286,L447164,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Doesn't answer the question.
239287,L447163,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You'd be breaking the law.
239288,L447162,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Would that make me a heel?
239289,L447161,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--"
239290,L447160,u7089,m475,BRANDON,That must hurt.
239291,L447159,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I have a warrant for her arrest.
239292,L447158,u7089,m475,BRANDON,A couple of hours.
239293,L447157,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
239294,L447156,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Could we discuss that some other time?
239295,L447155,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"""Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others."" Very appealing, especially to a poor man."
239296,L447154,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I wouldn't know.
239297,L447153,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?"
239298,L447152,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I never notice the view after the first week.
239299,L447151,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?"
239300,L447149,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Thanks.  I don't mind.
239301,L447148,u7089,m475,BRANDON,If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
239302,L447147,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Time for a little chat?
239303,L446807,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Well--good night.
239304,L446806,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I don't.
239305,L446805,u7089,m475,BRANDON,In case you want to have us followed.
239306,L446784,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation."
239307,L446783,u7089,m475,BRANDON,How are you two getting along?
239308,L446726,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?"
239309,L446725,u7089,m475,BRANDON,How about a cup of coffee?
239310,L446713,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"We do, when we get the chance."
239311,L446712,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure."
239312,L446711,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,It was lying where on the balcony?
239313,L446710,u7089,m475,BRANDON,No.
239314,L446709,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?"
239315,L446708,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Could be.
239316,L446707,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Quite sure you had no motive?
239317,L446706,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better."
239318,L446705,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Where?
239319,L446704,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Yes, I've seen it before."
239320,L446703,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Thank you.
239321,L446580,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course."
239322,L446579,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
239323,L446578,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
239324,L446577,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Hardly. Who's the girl?
239325,L446576,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
239326,L446544,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,If I can get off.
239327,L446543,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Round of golf Saturday?
239328,L446542,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,The usual grind.
239329,L446541,u7089,m475,BRANDON,How's life treating you?
239330,L446540,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
239331,L446530,u7089,m475,BRANDON,You're not English.
239332,L446529,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
239333,L446528,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,A private joke.
239334,L446527,u7089,m475,BRANDON,What?
239335,L446566,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
239336,L446565,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"You don't throw guests out, Brandon."
239337,L446564,u7089,m475,BRANDON,Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
239338,L446563,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"How would you know, Brandon?"
239339,L446562,u7089,m475,BRANDON,I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
239340,L446561,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Did I do something wrong?
239341,L446560,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench."
239342,L446498,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?"
239343,L446497,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Lay off, can't you?"
239344,L446496,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?"
239345,L446495,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
239346,L446494,u7089,m475,BRANDON,"Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?"
239347,L446413,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
239348,L446412,u7090,m475,CAMPBELL,"I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell."
239349,L446411,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
239350,L446410,u7090,m475,CAMPBELL,"Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell."
239351,L446409,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,A little something on account perhaps?
239352,L446408,u7090,m475,CAMPBELL,Mr. Mitchell.
239353,L446407,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell."
239354,L446761,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why."
239355,L446760,u7099,m475,MARGO,Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
239356,L446759,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,With what motive?
239357,L446758,u7099,m475,MARGO,"You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?"
239358,L446757,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
239359,L446756,u7099,m475,MARGO,"One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat."
239360,L446755,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"Convenient, isn't it?"
239361,L446754,u7099,m475,MARGO,They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
239362,L446753,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
239363,L446752,u7099,m475,MARGO,He saw my face too.
239364,L446751,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
239365,L446750,u7099,m475,MARGO,That's not enough.
239366,L446749,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again."
239367,L446748,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun."
239368,L446747,u7099,m475,MARGO,"You nasty, sardonic--"
239369,L446746,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him."
239370,L446745,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him."
239371,L446744,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say ""Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another""?  They always have another."
239372,L446743,u7099,m475,MARGO,Passkey?
239373,L446742,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys."
239374,L446741,u7099,m475,MARGO,What do you want?
239375,L446740,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,I don't think you locked your door.
239376,L446739,u7099,m475,MARGO,What are you doing here?
239377,L446664,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on."
239378,L446663,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
239379,L446355,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
239380,L446354,u7099,m475,MARGO,I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
239381,L446715,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
239382,L446714,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon."
239383,L446699,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Thank you.
239384,L446698,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"No, Not recently. I'm sure of that."
239385,L446697,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Recently, then."
239386,L446696,u7091,m475,CLARENDON,"I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about.."
239387,L446695,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?"
239388,L447401,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,We don't need him.
239389,L447400,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him."
239390,L447399,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"What's the face for, Driscoll?"
239391,L447146,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Men like you don't need orders.
239392,L447145,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?"
239393,L447144,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important."
239394,L447143,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector."
239395,L447142,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
239396,L447141,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections."
239397,L447140,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Would you?
239398,L447139,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,Send that?
239399,L447138,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police."
239400,L447137,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out."
239401,L447136,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
239402,L447135,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
239403,L447134,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
239404,L447133,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name."
239405,L447132,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
239406,L447131,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
239407,L447130,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"Got a moment, Inspector?"
239408,L447035,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,"I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical."
239409,L447034,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't"
239410,L447033,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Let me know when you've identified him
239411,L447032,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
239412,L447031,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
239413,L447030,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
239414,L447029,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
239415,L447028,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,Not a floater.  Only just dead.
239416,L447027,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Floater?
239417,L447026,u7092,m475,DRISCOLL,The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
239418,L446972,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,"When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough."
239419,L446971,u7093,m475,GOBLE,Open it and count it.
239420,L446970,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
239421,L446969,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
239422,L446968,u7093,m475,GOBLE,You get it's brother.
239423,L446967,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,What do I get for it?
239424,L446966,u7093,m475,GOBLE,One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
239425,L446965,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
239426,L446964,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
239427,L446963,u7093,m475,GOBLE,It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
239428,L446962,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,Go live in a tent.
239429,L446961,u7093,m475,GOBLE,"I have an appointment with him, right here, right now."
239430,L446960,u7096,m475,MAGRUDER,"The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?"
239431,L446959,u7093,m475,GOBLE,I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
239432,L447341,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here."
239433,L447340,u7094,m475,GORE,"Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number."
239434,L447338,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
239435,L447337,u7094,m475,GORE,"You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake."
239436,L447336,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Did we ever really think it was suicide?
239437,L447335,u7094,m475,GORE,No suicide.
239438,L447334,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise."
239439,L447333,u7094,m475,GORE,"And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out."
239440,L447332,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that."
239441,L447331,u7094,m475,GORE,How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
239442,L447330,u7094,m475,GORE,"I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon."
239443,L447329,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,So?
239444,L447328,u7094,m475,GORE,"I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide."
239445,L447327,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Well.  What about it?
239446,L447326,u7094,m475,GORE,This is the shell.  What about the gun?
239447,L447322,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
239448,L447321,u7094,m475,GORE,"Pretty big chance, huh?"
239449,L447320,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
239450,L447319,u7094,m475,GORE,Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
239451,L447318,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You can find out.
239452,L447317,u7094,m475,GORE,Do I know who lives down there?
239453,L447316,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
239454,L447315,u7094,m475,GORE,Such as?
239455,L447314,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position."
239456,L447313,u7094,m475,GORE,"Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them."
239457,L447312,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
239458,L447311,u7094,m475,GORE,If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
239459,L447310,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
239460,L447307,u7094,m475,GORE,Should be over there.
239461,L447306,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Where's the shell?
239462,L447305,u7094,m475,GORE,I think so.
239463,L447304,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Was that about the right angle?
239464,L447301,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
239465,L447300,u7094,m475,GORE,Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
239466,L447299,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Not too hard, is it?"
239467,L447297,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
239468,L447296,u7094,m475,GORE,"That's pretty risky business, Inspector."
239469,L447280,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
239470,L447279,u7094,m475,GORE,"Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold."
239471,L447278,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"""G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."""
239472,L447276,u7094,m475,GORE,I guess I'm just ballast around here.
239473,L447275,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I'll know when I find it.
239474,L447274,u7094,m475,GORE,"She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?"
239475,L446691,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up."
239476,L446690,u7094,m475,GORE,"Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector."
239477,L446689,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
239478,L446688,u7094,m475,GORE,Unless the gun was slanted up.
239479,L446687,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,So the shell ought to have gone over?
239480,L446686,u7094,m475,GORE,"This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall."
239481,L446682,u7094,m475,GORE,"Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there."
239482,L446681,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm."
239483,L446680,u7094,m475,GORE,"It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun."
239484,L446679,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I've met her.
239485,L446678,u7094,m475,GORE,"... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector."
239486,L446677,u7094,m475,GORE,They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
239487,L446676,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap."
239488,L446675,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as ""Inspector"". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me ""sir""."
239489,L446674,u7094,m475,GORE,Right.
239490,L446673,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,So it seems Sergeant.
239491,L446672,u7094,m475,GORE,You in charge here?
239492,L447002,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West."
239493,L447001,u7099,m475,MARGO,And if you didn't believe me?
239494,L447000,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night."
239495,L446999,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Now, you're being beastly."
239496,L446998,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
239497,L446997,u7099,m475,MARGO,I don't understand.
239498,L446996,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
239499,L446995,u7099,m475,MARGO,It does.  May I go now?
239500,L446994,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Not if it clears the air.
239501,L446993,u7099,m475,MARGO,"At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?"
239502,L446992,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Mortar shells are not funny, either."
239503,L446991,u7099,m475,MARGO,Did you ever have a serious operation?
239504,L446990,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,You didn't play it for laughs last night.
239505,L446989,u7099,m475,MARGO,Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
239506,L446988,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?"
239507,L446987,u7099,m475,MARGO,I am a fool.
239508,L446986,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
239509,L446985,u7099,m475,MARGO,You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
239510,L446984,u7099,m475,MARGO,It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
239511,L446983,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
239512,L446982,u7099,m475,MARGO,"How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you."
239513,L446981,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?"
239514,L446724,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Thank you very much, Mrs. West."
239515,L446723,u7099,m475,MARGO,I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
239516,L446722,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
239517,L446721,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself."
239518,L446720,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?"
239519,L446719,u7099,m475,MARGO,I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
239520,L446718,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?"
239521,L446717,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Not quiet yet.
239522,L446716,u7099,m475,MARGO,What about me?
239523,L446702,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Positive?
239524,L446701,u7099,m475,MARGO,I never saw it before.
239525,L446526,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Warm water, no doubt."
239526,L446525,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Scotch and plain water, I think."
239527,L446517,u7099,m475,MARGO,Are you always this witty?
239528,L446516,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Oh nothing.
239529,L446515,u7099,m475,MARGO,May you what?
239530,L446512,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West."
239531,L446511,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?"
239532,L447398,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,Brandon handled the money envelope.
239533,L447397,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"The card says so, doesn't it?"
239534,L447396,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
239535,L447392,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I'll take your word.
239536,L447391,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
239537,L447390,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,She might.
239538,L447389,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,Mayfield?  She fit into this?
239539,L447388,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
239540,L447387,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,So far.
239541,L447386,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,That leaves two strangers.
239542,L447385,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,He checks too.
239543,L447384,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,How about Magruder?
239544,L447383,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,No doubt about that one.
239545,L447381,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,"Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes."
239546,L447380,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I'm interested in who handled it.
239547,L447379,u7104,m475,TECHNICIAN,"Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know."
239548,L447126,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
239549,L447125,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"What are my orders, sir?"
239550,L447124,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,Get out of here!
239551,L447123,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
239552,L447122,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Not too far, I hope."
239553,L447121,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
239554,L447120,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
239555,L447119,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
239556,L447118,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Two.
239557,L447117,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,I believe you won decorations during the war.
239558,L447115,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,I do.
239559,L447114,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,But you still think she's innocent.
239560,L447113,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I think you'd be entirely justified, sir."

239566,L447107,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,"And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?"
239567,L447106,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
239568,L447105,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,"Ye have, have ye?"
239569,L447104,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it."
239570,L447103,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,"This girl is a murderess, Killaine."
239571,L447102,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty."

239573,L447100,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"I don't know, sir."
239574,L447099,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,"It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?"
239575,L447098,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either."
239576,L447097,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
239577,L447021,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,"When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?"
239578,L447020,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
239579,L447017,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,Aye.  You have a point there.
239580,L447016,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
239581,L447015,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,I hear she's a very pretty girl.
239582,L447014,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,No.
239583,L447011,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,"She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?"
239584,L447010,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one."
239585,L447009,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
239586,L447008,u7095,m475,KILLAINE,"How do you do, sir."
239587,L447007,u7100,m475,MCKECHNIE,"Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto."
239588,L446548,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
239589,L446547,u7099,m475,MARGO,"You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated."
239590,L446537,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I say YES!
239591,L446536,u7099,m475,MARGO,She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
239592,L446535,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there."
239593,L446534,u7099,m475,MARGO,"I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell."
239594,L446533,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Be nasty.
239595,L446532,u7099,m475,MARGO,"It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted."
239596,L446531,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
239597,L446406,u7099,m475,MARGO,"In an hour, Larry."
239598,L446405,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Right.
239599,L446404,u7099,m475,MARGO,A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
239600,L446403,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I told you she's just..
239601,L446402,u7099,m475,MARGO,How about your new friend?
239602,L446401,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Of course.
239603,L446400,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?"
239604,L446399,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
239605,L446398,u7099,m475,MARGO,"You already have the checks, darling."
239606,L446397,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
239607,L446396,u7099,m475,MARGO,"Years, why?"
239608,L446395,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,How long have you had it?
239609,L446394,u7099,m475,MARGO,What does it look like?
239610,L446393,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,What's this?
239611,L446392,u7099,m475,MARGO,Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
239612,L446391,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,That's not very kind.
239613,L446390,u7099,m475,MARGO,I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
239614,L446388,u7099,m475,MARGO,"I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you."
239615,L446387,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
239616,L446386,u7099,m475,MARGO,You don't have to make a pose of it.
239617,L446385,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
239618,L446383,u7099,m475,MARGO,"She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up."
239619,L446382,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"What'll we do about it, Margo?"
239620,L446381,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
239621,L446380,u7099,m475,MARGO,You'd go to jail. For a long term.
239622,L446379,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I have a rough idea.
239623,L446378,u7099,m475,MARGO,You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
239624,L446377,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
239625,L446375,u7099,m475,MARGO,Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
239626,L446374,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
239627,L446373,u7099,m475,MARGO,You ought to know why.
239628,L446372,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
239629,L446371,u7099,m475,MARGO,"She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope."
239630,L446370,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way."
239631,L446369,u7099,m475,MARGO,As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
239632,L446368,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
239633,L446367,u7099,m475,MARGO,Why should I mind?
239634,L446366,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
239635,L446365,u7099,m475,MARGO,Nice.
239636,L446364,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
239637,L446363,u7099,m475,MARGO,Who's the girl?
239638,L446362,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,So-so.
239639,L446361,u7099,m475,MARGO,With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
239640,L446360,u7101,m475,MITCHELL,"I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo."
239641,L449019,u7106,m476,ANN,"Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism."
239642,L449018,u7111,m476,JAMES,What went wrong?
239643,L449017,u7106,m476,ANN,"Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong."
239644,L449016,u7111,m476,JAMES,Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
239645,L449015,u7106,m476,ANN,"Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all."
239646,L449014,u7111,m476,JAMES,Yes.
239647,L449013,u7106,m476,ANN,Shall we go?
239648,L449005,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Well, we were just..."
239649,L449004,u7106,m476,ANN,"Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you."
239650,L448994,u7106,m476,ANN,"These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ..."
239651,L448993,u7111,m476,JAMES,"I will, thanks."
239652,L448992,u7106,m476,ANN,The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
239653,L448865,u7106,m476,ANN,"We'll see you next week, and if--"
239654,L448864,u7111,m476,JAMES,Thank you.
239655,L448863,u7106,m476,ANN,Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
239656,L448862,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance."
239657,L448861,u7106,m476,ANN,"She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia."
239658,L448860,u7111,m476,JAMES,Yes.
239659,L448859,u7106,m476,ANN,It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
239660,L448858,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends."
239661,L448857,u7106,m476,ANN,I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
239662,L448855,u7106,m476,ANN,I think you'll do very well.
239663,L448854,u7111,m476,JAMES,You're kind to be so encouraging.
239664,L448853,u7106,m476,ANN,"If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you."
239665,L448852,u7111,m476,JAMES,So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
239666,L448851,u7111,m476,JAMES,Thanks.
239667,L448850,u7106,m476,ANN,Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pt.
239668,L448849,u7106,m476,ANN,"If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present."
239669,L448848,u7111,m476,JAMES,History books are first onto the bonfires.
239670,L448847,u7106,m476,ANN,To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
239671,L448846,u7111,m476,JAMES,To Ann.
239672,L448845,u7106,m476,ANN,And I'd like you to call me Ann.
239673,L448844,u7111,m476,JAMES,Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
239674,L448843,u7106,m476,ANN,"Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?"
239675,L448842,u7111,m476,JAMES,"It's fine, thank you."
239676,L448841,u7106,m476,ANN,"My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?"
239677,L448840,u7106,m476,ANN,Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
239678,L448839,u7111,m476,JAMES,Yes.
239679,L448838,u7106,m476,ANN,"I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?"
239680,L448837,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--"
239681,L448836,u7106,m476,ANN,"It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man."
239682,L448835,u7111,m476,JAMES,What a shame.
239683,L448834,u7106,m476,ANN,"My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on."
239684,L448833,u7111,m476,JAMES,He was delightful.
239685,L448832,u7106,m476,ANN,He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
239686,L448831,u7106,m476,ANN,"Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'."
239687,L448830,u7111,m476,JAMES,It's kind of you to see me.
239688,L448829,u7106,m476,ANN,Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
239689,L448910,u7111,m476,JAMES,"I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks."
239690,L448909,u7107,m476,CARMEN,But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
239691,L448908,u7111,m476,JAMES,Terrific.
239692,L448903,u7111,m476,JAMES,Very good.
239693,L448902,u7107,m476,CARMEN,"Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country."
239694,L448899,u7107,m476,CARMEN,"That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?"
239695,L448898,u7111,m476,JAMES,But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
239696,L448891,u7107,m476,CARMEN,"This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen."
239697,L448890,u7111,m476,JAMES,Penfield.  James Penfield.
239698,L448889,u7107,m476,CARMEN,"Now first of all, tell us your name."
239699,L448880,u7107,m476,CARMEN,"Sit on that log, dear."
239700,L448879,u7111,m476,JAMES,Thank you.
239701,L449035,u7111,m476,JAMES,Exactly that.
239702,L449034,u7108,m476,CHARLES,Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
239703,L448941,u7108,m476,CHARLES,"Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it."
239704,L448940,u7111,m476,JAMES,"No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?"
239705,L448939,u7108,m476,CHARLES,"She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over."
239706,L448938,u7111,m476,JAMES,How's Mary?
239707,L448937,u7111,m476,JAMES,Keep me company.
239708,L448936,u7108,m476,CHARLES,I'm not sure I can face it.
239709,L448935,u7111,m476,JAMES,Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
239710,L448934,u7108,m476,CHARLES,"Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?"
239711,L448933,u7111,m476,JAMES,Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
239712,L448711,u7112,m476,JEREMY,A glamorous young lady way above his station...
239713,L448710,u7109,m476,EDWARD,Congratulations.  Who with?
239714,L448707,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice."
239715,L448706,u7109,m476,EDWARD,"Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?"
239716,L448705,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Of course.
239717,L448704,u7109,m476,EDWARD,Attributed?
239718,L448701,u7109,m476,EDWARD,I see.
239719,L448700,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Committed to memory.  Forever.
239720,L448699,u7109,m476,EDWARD,"Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy."
239721,L448698,u7112,m476,JEREMY,It's terribly good.
239722,L449119,u7111,m476,JAMES,And to history.
239723,L449118,u7110,m476,GOLD,"It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez."
239724,L449117,u7111,m476,JAMES,Thank you.
239725,L449116,u7110,m476,GOLD,"James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it."
239726,L448650,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that."
239727,L448649,u7110,m476,GOLD,"You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership."
239728,L448648,u7111,m476,JAMES,Freshman and sophomores...
239729,L448647,u7110,m476,GOLD,"Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students..."
239730,L448643,u7111,m476,JAMES,Thank you.
239731,L448642,u7110,m476,GOLD,And you'll join me in a sambucca?
239732,L448641,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Yes, please."
239733,L448640,u7110,m476,GOLD,Are you going to have coffee?
239734,L448639,u7111,m476,JAMES,"I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--"
239735,L448638,u7110,m476,GOLD,Good.
239736,L448637,u7111,m476,JAMES,No.  I'd want to--
239737,L448636,u7110,m476,GOLD,Yes...You're not a socialist then?
239738,L448635,u7111,m476,JAMES,...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
239739,L448634,u7110,m476,GOLD,And some of that.  Sorry.
239740,L448633,u7111,m476,JAMES,...break away completely from--
239741,L448632,u7110,m476,GOLD,I'll have some of that.
239742,L448631,u7111,m476,JAMES,No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
239743,L448630,u7110,m476,GOLD,Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
239744,L448589,u7110,m476,GOLD,"I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees..."
239745,L448588,u7111,m476,JAMES,Hello.
239746,L448587,u7110,m476,GOLD,"I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book."
239747,L449084,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I know.  I'm sorry.
239748,L449083,u7111,m476,JAMES,We don't seem to get much time to talk.
239749,L449079,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
239750,L449078,u7111,m476,JAMES,Shall we have a drink or something?
239751,L449003,u7111,m476,JAMES,Why not.
239752,L449002,u7116,m476,SUSAN,In your car
239753,L449001,u7111,m476,JAMES,That'll be fun
239754,L449000,u7116,m476,SUSAN,He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
239755,L448999,u7111,m476,JAMES,What did he want?
239756,L448998,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Jeremy phoned this morning
239757,L448978,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother."
239758,L448977,u7111,m476,JAMES,Might?
239759,L448971,u7111,m476,JAMES,Might?
239760,L448970,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I might.
239761,L448969,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?"
239762,L448966,u7111,m476,JAMES,"He's all right, the professor."
239763,L448965,u7116,m476,SUSAN,No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
239764,L448964,u7111,m476,JAMES,I haven't seen much of you.
239765,L448931,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Well, you should."
239766,L448930,u7111,m476,JAMES,I haven't really thought about it.
239767,L448929,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
239768,L448927,u7111,m476,JAMES,"No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese."
239769,L448926,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Did she talk about me?
239770,L448925,u7111,m476,JAMES,I think she liked me.
239771,L448924,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?"
239772,L448790,u7116,m476,SUSAN,You just might.
239773,L448789,u7111,m476,JAMES,I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
239774,L448788,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
239775,L448787,u7111,m476,JAMES,In radio we're different.
239776,L448786,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
239777,L448785,u7111,m476,JAMES,You don't trust me.
239778,L448783,u7111,m476,JAMES,Too late.  Just my luck.
239779,L448782,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
239780,L448781,u7111,m476,JAMES,Me too.
239781,L448780,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I have to be up early.
239782,L448779,u7111,m476,JAMES,Why not stay?
239783,L448725,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Yes, if you like.  Call me at work."
239784,L448724,u7111,m476,JAMES,Again?
239785,L448723,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Well, you know..."
239786,L448722,u7111,m476,JAMES,Very thoughtful.
239787,L448721,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I called you a taxi.
239788,L448720,u7111,m476,JAMES,Who?
239789,L448719,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Damn.  They're early.
239790,L448718,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--"
239791,L448717,u7111,m476,JAMES,Both dead.
239792,L448716,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours."
239793,L448715,u7111,m476,JAMES,How nice.
239794,L448714,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters."
239795,L448692,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway."
239796,L448691,u7111,m476,JAMES,Oh yes?
239797,L448690,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job."
239798,L448689,u7111,m476,JAMES,"No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way."
239799,L448688,u7116,m476,SUSAN,And you're at this third stage
239800,L448687,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism."
239801,L448686,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"My real father?  Well, he was a flashback."
239802,L448685,u7111,m476,JAMES,Too bad.  What did your father do?
239803,L448684,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
239804,L448683,u7111,m476,JAMES,You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
239805,L448682,u7111,m476,JAMES,Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
239806,L448681,u7116,m476,SUSAN,And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
239807,L448680,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Oh, but he was terrific."
239808,L448679,u7116,m476,SUSAN,And I didn't like that man.
239809,L448678,u7111,m476,JAMES,I couldn't bear for it to end.
239810,L448677,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I think it went on rather too long.
239811,L448676,u7111,m476,JAMES,I thought it was tremendous.
239812,L448675,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
239813,L448674,u7111,m476,JAMES,What did you think of that Wadja film?
239814,L448616,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night."
239815,L448615,u7111,m476,JAMES,Can I give you a lift?
239816,L448613,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too."
239817,L448612,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak."
239818,L448611,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good."
239819,L448601,u7111,m476,JAMES,That's her.
239820,L448600,u7116,m476,SUSAN,So it's all worked out perfectly...
239821,L449115,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies."
239822,L449114,u7111,m476,JAMES,You're a piece of shit
239823,L449113,u7112,m476,JEREMY,It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
239824,L449112,u7111,m476,JAMES,My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
239825,L449111,u7112,m476,JEREMY,And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
239826,L449110,u7111,m476,JAMES,Fuck off.
239827,L449109,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Susan and I are very old friends, James."
239828,L449100,u7111,m476,JAMES,Are you up to something?
239829,L449099,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot."
239830,L449098,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Yes, finally."
239831,L449097,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
239832,L449060,u7111,m476,JAMES,I'm not sure.
239833,L449059,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Still in love?
239834,L448923,u7111,m476,JAMES,I'll ring you.
239835,L448922,u7112,m476,JEREMY,I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
239836,L448921,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Perhaps I will, then."
239837,L448918,u7111,m476,JAMES,Will it be fun?
239838,L448917,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
239839,L448916,u7111,m476,JAMES,Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
239840,L448915,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
239841,L448799,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?"
239842,L448798,u7111,m476,JAMES,Hold those rights.
239843,L448797,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--"
239844,L448796,u7111,m476,JAMES,The torture of small children--
239845,L448795,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, ""Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"""
239846,L448794,u7111,m476,JAMES,What have you been up to?
239847,L448793,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Far too long.
239848,L448792,u7111,m476,JAMES,We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
239849,L448791,u7112,m476,JEREMY,That's enough of that.
239850,L448751,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks."
239851,L448750,u7111,m476,JAMES,"You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?"
239852,L448749,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend."
239853,L448748,u7111,m476,JAMES,Ha ha...
239854,L448747,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there."
239855,L448746,u7111,m476,JAMES,You're so gross.
239856,L448745,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal..."
239857,L448744,u7111,m476,JAMES,Mmm...
239858,L448743,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot."
239859,L448742,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary."
239860,L448741,u7111,m476,JAMES,Let me see.
239861,L448740,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you."
239862,L448739,u7111,m476,JAMES,Oh yes.
239863,L448738,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest..."
239864,L448737,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Jeremy, just let me see what you've got."
239865,L448736,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--"
239866,L448735,u7111,m476,JAMES,Let me see.
239867,L448734,u7112,m476,JEREMY,You approve!
239868,L448733,u7111,m476,JAMES,It's shit.
239869,L448732,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
239870,L448731,u7111,m476,JAMES,Come on.  Hand over.
239871,L448730,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Now, top secret file."
239872,L448729,u7111,m476,JAMES,The Argies.
239873,L448728,u7112,m476,JEREMY,And the Argies.
239874,L448727,u7111,m476,JAMES,To the Fleet.
239875,L448726,u7112,m476,JEREMY,To the Fleet.
239876,L448713,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist..."
239877,L448712,u7111,m476,JAMES,Bastard.
239878,L448709,u7112,m476,JEREMY,No jokes.  James is in love.
239879,L448708,u7111,m476,JAMES,C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
239880,L448703,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"We were just chortling over that. Blas and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today."
239881,L448702,u7111,m476,JAMES,Blas and epicene.
239882,L448597,u7111,m476,JAMES,Nonsense.
239883,L448596,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA."
239884,L448595,u7111,m476,JAMES,Not yet you know any of these people?
239885,L448594,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
239886,L448593,u7111,m476,JAMES,To the airlift.
239887,L448592,u7112,m476,JEREMY,To the airlift.
239888,L448591,u7111,m476,JAMES,Not here.
239889,L448828,u7117,m476,TOM,They don't count.
239890,L448827,u7111,m476,JAMES,What about the Cromwells?
239891,L448826,u7117,m476,TOM,"It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II."
239892,L448825,u7111,m476,JAMES,All right.
239893,L448824,u7117,m476,TOM,Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
239894,L448823,u7111,m476,JAMES,Suez.  1956.
239895,L448822,u7117,m476,TOM,What period?
239896,L448821,u7111,m476,JAMES,Not at all.  History.
239897,L448820,u7117,m476,TOM,Have you come to talk about me?
239898,L448819,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Oh, I see."
239899,L448818,u7117,m476,TOM,"She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy."
239900,L448817,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Okay, I will."
239901,L448816,u7117,m476,TOM,Why not sit down and wait?
239902,L448815,u7111,m476,JAMES,Thanks.
239903,L448814,u7117,m476,TOM,"She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. ."
239904,L448813,u7111,m476,JAMES,I'm waiting for your mother.
239905,L448812,u7117,m476,TOM,Hello.
239906,L448811,u7111,m476,JAMES,Hello.
239907,L449033,u7111,m476,JAMES,Next time tell her I've gone away.
239908,L449032,u7115,m476,PHILIP,"I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back."
239909,L449031,u7111,m476,JAMES,I'm not here.
239910,L449030,u7115,m476,PHILIP,It's that lady from Norfolk again.
239911,L448775,u7111,m476,JAMES,Terrific.
239912,L448774,u7115,m476,PHILIP,Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
239913,L448773,u7111,m476,JAMES,Not bad.
239914,L448772,u7115,m476,PHILIP,Take a look at these.
239915,L448771,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?"
239916,L448673,u7111,m476,JAMES,I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
239917,L448672,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
239918,L448671,u7111,m476,JAMES,I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
239919,L448670,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,Or a beer.  I've got some in.
239920,L448669,u7111,m476,JAMES,"No, thanks Dad."
239921,L448668,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,"Now, are you going to have some more tea?"
239922,L448667,u7111,m476,JAMES,"Yes, you said."
239923,L448666,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
239924,L448665,u7111,m476,JAMES,That's good.
239925,L448664,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,"Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work."
239926,L448658,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,"Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that."
239927,L448657,u7111,m476,JAMES,"I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away."
239928,L448656,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,"Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming..."
239929,L448655,u7111,m476,JAMES,So how is she?
239930,L448654,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
239931,L448653,u7111,m476,JAMES,Dad.
239932,L448652,u7114,m476,MR. PENFIELD,"Hello, Jimmy."
239933,L449058,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,"No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission."
239934,L449057,u7111,m476,JAMES,Now listen...
239935,L449056,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,"You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife."
239936,L449055,u7111,m476,JAMES,She said that?
239937,L449054,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,"Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive."
239938,L449051,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,"In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was."
239939,L449050,u7111,m476,JAMES,U-huh.
239940,L449049,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
239941,L449048,u7111,m476,JAMES,I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
239942,L449047,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,What would you call it?
239943,L449046,u7111,m476,JAMES,Yes.
239944,L449045,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,"I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating."
239945,L449023,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,"Well, it's worth seeing."
239946,L449022,u7111,m476,JAMES,No.
239947,L449021,u7113,m476,MATTHEW,I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
239948,L449095,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'"
239949,L449094,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
239950,L449093,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'"
239951,L449092,u7112,m476,JEREMY,It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
239952,L449091,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press."
239953,L449076,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Promise.
239954,L449075,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Promise?
239955,L449074,u7112,m476,JEREMY,We'll see what we can do.
239956,L449072,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you."
239957,L449071,u7112,m476,JEREMY,You'd look naked without one.
239958,L449070,u7116,m476,SUSAN,What have you got there?
239959,L449066,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Voila!
239960,L449065,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Don't point it at James!
239961,L449063,u7112,m476,JEREMY,They won't let you in without one.
239962,L449062,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Oh no!
239963,L449061,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
239964,L448920,u7112,m476,JEREMY,We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
239965,L448919,u7116,m476,SUSAN,It was last year.
239966,L448610,u7112,m476,JEREMY,"In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift."
239967,L448609,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film."
239968,L448608,u7112,m476,JEREMY,And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
239969,L448607,u7116,m476,SUSAN,You're so famous now.
239970,L448606,u7112,m476,JEREMY,Darling Susan.
239971,L448605,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
239972,L449008,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him."
239973,L449007,u7117,m476,TOM,No.
239974,L449006,u7116,m476,SUSAN,"Don't you want to walk, Tom?"
239975,L448968,u7116,m476,SUSAN,Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
239976,L448967,u7117,m476,TOM,"Ah, Susy, it..."
239977,L448963,u7117,m476,TOM,'Night.
239978,L448962,u7116,m476,SUSAN,I won't.  Goodnight.
239979,L448961,u7117,m476,TOM,Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
239980,L449774,u7123,m477,UTAH,I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
239981,L449773,u7118,m477,BODHI,You never were...
239982,L449772,u7123,m477,UTAH,I'm not FBI anymore.
239983,L449771,u7118,m477,BODHI,"And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah."
239984,L449758,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Jesus Christ, Bodhi!"
239985,L449757,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Wild ride, huh?"
239986,L449756,u7123,m477,UTAH,SHIT!!
239987,L449755,u7118,m477,BODHI,Three seconds... two... one...
239988,L449753,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four..."
239989,L449752,u7123,m477,UTAH,Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
239990,L449751,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?"
239991,L449750,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Naw, you pull it!"
239992,L449749,u7123,m477,UTAH,"No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!"
239993,L449748,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?"
239994,L449741,u7123,m477,UTAH,"What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out."
239995,L449740,u7118,m477,BODHI,Why should I?
239996,L449713,u7123,m477,UTAH,The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
239997,L449712,u7118,m477,BODHI,I say when it's over!
239998,L449711,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over."
239999,L449710,u7118,m477,BODHI,And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
240000,L449709,u7123,m477,UTAH,You gotta tell me where she is.
240001,L449708,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?"
240002,L449707,u7123,m477,UTAH,Where's Roach?
240003,L449706,u7123,m477,UTAH,Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
240004,L449705,u7118,m477,BODHI,But you're not alone.
240005,L449704,u7123,m477,UTAH,I'm not armed.
240006,L449665,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?"
240007,L449664,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!"
240008,L449663,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?"
240009,L449662,u7123,m477,UTAH,I can't do this.
240010,L449654,u7118,m477,BODHI,"See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade."
240011,L449653,u7123,m477,UTAH,We're wasting time.
240012,L449651,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there."
240013,L449650,u7123,m477,UTAH,You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
240014,L449649,u7118,m477,BODHI,"She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now."
240015,L449648,u7123,m477,UTAH,Talk.
240016,L449647,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second."
240017,L449646,u7123,m477,UTAH,You're a fucking dead man--
240018,L449644,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play."
240019,L449643,u7123,m477,UTAH,What's this?
240020,L449639,u7118,m477,BODHI,Okay!
240021,L449638,u7123,m477,UTAH,You first!
240022,L449637,u7118,m477,BODHI,One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
240023,L449636,u7123,m477,UTAH,You do it... you first!
240024,L449635,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Don't screw around man, pull it!"
240025,L449634,u7123,m477,UTAH,"After you, Alfonse.  I insist!"
240026,L449633,u7118,m477,BODHI,You gonna pull?
240027,L449624,u7118,m477,BODHI,I'll take that as a yes.
240028,L449623,u7123,m477,UTAH,Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
240029,L449622,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Utah, you copy bruddah?"
240030,L449621,u7118,m477,BODHI,My man!
240031,L449620,u7123,m477,UTAH,We gonna jump or jerk off?
240032,L449617,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine."
240033,L449616,u7123,m477,UTAH,You gotta earn trust.
240034,L449615,u7118,m477,BODHI,I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
240035,L449614,u7123,m477,UTAH,"So, who... uh, who packed my chute?"
240036,L449613,u7118,m477,BODHI,It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
240037,L449611,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!"
240038,L449610,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--"
240039,L449609,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump."
240040,L449608,u7123,m477,UTAH,Once.
240041,L449607,u7118,m477,BODHI,Ever done this before?
240042,L449603,u7118,m477,BODHI,"'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight."
240043,L449602,u7123,m477,UTAH,One shot stopping.
240044,L449597,u7118,m477,BODHI,"News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place."
240045,L449596,u7123,m477,UTAH,How you figure?
240046,L449441,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated."
240047,L449440,u7118,m477,BODHI,"The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see."
240048,L449439,u7123,m477,UTAH,A flaw I'm working on.
240049,L449438,u7118,m477,BODHI,"I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win."
240050,L449437,u7123,m477,UTAH,"I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here."
240051,L449436,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave."
240052,L449435,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Yeah, but are you crazy enough?"
240053,L449434,u7123,m477,UTAH,I gotta be fucking crazy.
240054,L449412,u7118,m477,BODHI,"No, Bells Beach, Australia."
240055,L449411,u7123,m477,UTAH,So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
240056,L449396,u7118,m477,BODHI,Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
240057,L449395,u7123,m477,UTAH,Don't you gamble?
240058,L449378,u7118,m477,BODHI,Come with Tyler.  She knows.
240059,L449377,u7123,m477,UTAH,Where?
240060,L449376,u7123,m477,UTAH,Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
240061,L449375,u7118,m477,BODHI,De nada.
240062,L449374,u7123,m477,UTAH,Thanks for stepping in.
240063,L449373,u7118,m477,BODHI,No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
240064,L449372,u7123,m477,UTAH,You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
240065,L449371,u7118,m477,BODHI,"They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it."
240066,L449370,u7123,m477,UTAH,What's their program?
240067,L449369,u7118,m477,BODHI,"The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here."
240068,L449368,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Friends of yours, huh?"
240069,L449305,u7123,m477,UTAH,Not yet.
240070,L449304,u7118,m477,BODHI,"Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?"
240071,L449303,u7123,m477,UTAH,Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
240072,L449302,u7118,m477,BODHI,And that's why you never went pro?
240073,L449301,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way."
240074,L449300,u7118,m477,BODHI,Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
240075,L449478,u7119,m477,FIBERGLASS,There's nobody else here...
240076,L449477,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
240077,L449476,u7119,m477,FIBERGLASS,"Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--"
240078,L449475,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
240079,L449468,u7119,m477,FIBERGLASS,No.
240080,L449467,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
240081,L449466,u7119,m477,FIBERGLASS,Yeah?  What?
240082,L449695,u7123,m477,UTAH,Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
240083,L449694,u7120,m477,HARP,"Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?"
240084,L449318,u7123,m477,UTAH,Caught my first tube this morning.
240085,L449317,u7120,m477,HARP,"Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?"
240086,L449315,u7123,m477,UTAH,"The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean."
240087,L449314,u7120,m477,HARP,What?
240088,L449313,u7123,m477,UTAH,Babes.
240089,L449312,u7120,m477,HARP,"A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?"
240090,L449311,u7123,m477,UTAH,A little mushy.
240091,L449310,u7120,m477,HARP,Surf conditions okay?
240092,L449309,u7123,m477,UTAH,Fine.
240093,L449308,u7120,m477,HARP,How was the beach?
240094,L449150,u7123,m477,UTAH,Not so far.
240095,L449149,u7120,m477,HARP,"You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage."
240096,L449147,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Zero distortion, sir."
240097,L449146,u7120,m477,HARP,"That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?"
240098,L449145,u7123,m477,UTAH,1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
240099,L449144,u7120,m477,HARP,This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
240100,L449143,u7123,m477,UTAH,I take the skin off chicken.
240101,L449142,u7120,m477,HARP,"All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes..."
240102,L449141,u7123,m477,UTAH,Sir?
240103,L449140,u7120,m477,HARP,"Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?"
240104,L449139,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Yes, sir."
240105,L449138,u7120,m477,HARP,"You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't."
240106,L449699,u7120,m477,HARP,What that?
240107,L449698,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?"
240108,L449697,u7120,m477,HARP,"Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--"
240109,L449696,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in."
240110,L449194,u7120,m477,HARP,"Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?"
240111,L449193,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?"
240112,L449192,u7120,m477,HARP,"That's the point, isn't it?"
240113,L449191,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
240114,L449190,u7120,m477,HARP,Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
240115,L449189,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
240116,L449188,u7120,m477,HARP,They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
240117,L449721,u7123,m477,UTAH,NOOO!!
240118,L449720,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Kid, get outta the way!!"
240119,L449719,u7123,m477,UTAH,Angelo!  Don't fire!
240120,L449702,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Figured you did.
240121,L449701,u7123,m477,UTAH,I know where they're going.
240122,L449561,u7123,m477,UTAH,Nothing.
240123,L449560,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Nothing?
240124,L449547,u7123,m477,UTAH,You sure?!
240125,L449546,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,They took a left at the next light!
240126,L449545,u7123,m477,UTAH,The hell are they?!
240127,L449536,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
240128,L449535,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Angelo, it's eleven thirty."
240129,L449534,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Time for lunch.
240130,L449533,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are."
240131,L449532,u7123,m477,UTAH,I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
240132,L449531,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard."
240133,L449530,u7123,m477,UTAH,I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
240134,L449528,u7123,m477,UTAH,No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
240135,L449527,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,They're on their way to Maui.
240136,L449523,u7123,m477,UTAH,Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
240137,L449522,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report."
240138,L449521,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling."
240139,L449520,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Yeah, or cashing a check."
240140,L449519,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!"
240141,L449518,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Did he rob it?
240142,L449517,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan."
240143,L449516,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,This Zen master surfer.
240144,L449515,u7123,m477,UTAH,... so I started tailing him.
240145,L449512,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Angelo, we gotta talk."
240146,L449511,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?"
240147,L449498,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Nice tattoo, Dietz."
240148,L449497,u7123,m477,UTAH,Aw shit.
240149,L449464,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
240150,L449463,u7123,m477,UTAH,Got it.
240151,L449462,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?"
240152,L449461,u7123,m477,UTAH,"I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?"
240153,L449459,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Right here, partner."
240154,L449458,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
240155,L449391,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning."
240156,L449390,u7123,m477,UTAH,When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
240157,L449385,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers."
240158,L449384,u7123,m477,UTAH,"... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile."
240159,L449382,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Okay, Dad."
240160,L449381,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?"
240161,L449367,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Thanks, buddy."
240162,L449366,u7123,m477,UTAH,"No, but there are four guys back there you might check out."
240163,L449345,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all."
240164,L449344,u7123,m477,UTAH,Big zippo so far.  How about you?
240165,L449329,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp."
240166,L449328,u7123,m477,UTAH,"The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?"
240167,L449327,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
240168,L449326,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic."
240169,L449321,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon."
240170,L449320,u7123,m477,UTAH,"It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this."
240171,L449319,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?"
240172,L449235,u7123,m477,UTAH,Got it...
240173,L449234,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,I think you gotta hit them straight on!
240174,L449233,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?"
240175,L449232,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet."
240176,L449231,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
240177,L449229,u7123,m477,UTAH,Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
240178,L449228,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Johnny, it's the only way."
240179,L449221,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
240180,L449220,u7123,m477,UTAH,... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
240181,L449218,u7123,m477,UTAH,Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
240182,L449217,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
240183,L449216,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?"
240184,L449215,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em."
240185,L449214,u7123,m477,UTAH,Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
240186,L449213,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products."
240187,L449212,u7123,m477,UTAH,Oh well he must be a surfer.
240188,L449210,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,The fucking punks are surfers.
240189,L449209,u7123,m477,UTAH,Yeah.  What's your theory?
240190,L449208,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
240191,L449207,u7123,m477,UTAH,Sorry.
240192,L449206,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
240193,L449205,u7123,m477,UTAH,"So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity."
240194,L449204,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?"
240195,L449203,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Well, what're your ideas on these guys?"
240196,L449202,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one."
240197,L449182,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid."
240198,L449181,u7123,m477,UTAH,Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
240199,L449180,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish."
240200,L449179,u7123,m477,UTAH,Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
240201,L449178,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
240202,L449177,u7123,m477,UTAH,They don't go for the vault?
240203,L449176,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers."
240204,L449175,u7123,m477,UTAH,Good move.
240205,L449164,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Welcome to Sea World, kid."
240206,L449163,u7123,m477,UTAH,Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
240207,L449162,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
240208,L449159,u7123,m477,UTAH,"The shit they pull, huh?"
240209,L449158,u7121,m477,PAPPAS,"Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something."
240210,L449583,u7122,m477,TYLER,"Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!"
240211,L449582,u7123,m477,UTAH,"I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--"
240212,L449580,u7122,m477,TYLER,You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
240213,L449579,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Tyler, put the gun down."
240214,L449578,u7122,m477,TYLER,"Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?"
240215,L449572,u7122,m477,TYLER,"But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?"
240216,L449571,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Never saw him, was your basic hit and run."
240217,L449570,u7122,m477,TYLER,So what'd the other guy look like?
240218,L449569,u7123,m477,UTAH,You're kneeling on my hand.
240219,L449568,u7122,m477,TYLER,Betadyne doesn't hurt.
240220,L449567,u7123,m477,UTAH,Ouch.
240221,L449508,u7123,m477,UTAH,"No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry."
240222,L449507,u7122,m477,TYLER,Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
240223,L449506,u7123,m477,UTAH,I... I gotta go.
240224,L449454,u7123,m477,UTAH,Warm them up.
240225,L449453,u7122,m477,TYLER,Those are cold.
240226,L449451,u7122,m477,TYLER,You don't have to.
240227,L449450,u7123,m477,UTAH,I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
240228,L449449,u7122,m477,TYLER,"Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy."
240229,L449448,u7123,m477,UTAH,What?
240230,L449447,u7122,m477,TYLER,Look at you.
240231,L449446,u7123,m477,UTAH,Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
240232,L449445,u7122,m477,TYLER,You had enough?
240233,L449433,u7122,m477,TYLER,Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
240234,L449432,u7123,m477,UTAH,I can barely do this in broad daylight.
240235,L449429,u7122,m477,TYLER,"Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows."
240236,L449428,u7123,m477,UTAH,What's goin' on?
240237,L449424,u7122,m477,TYLER,"I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi."
240238,L449423,u7123,m477,UTAH,What are you talking about?
240239,L449422,u7122,m477,TYLER,Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
240240,L449404,u7122,m477,TYLER,"Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover."
240241,L449403,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Sure, he's ""the Bodhisattva""."
240242,L449402,u7122,m477,TYLER,"We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different."
240243,L449401,u7123,m477,UTAH,Meaning you were expendable.
240244,L449400,u7122,m477,TYLER,People are expendable to Bodhi.
240245,L449399,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Oh, oh.  That sounds personal."
240246,L449398,u7122,m477,TYLER,Catch of the day.
240247,L449397,u7123,m477,UTAH,Who's the girl?
240248,L449393,u7122,m477,TYLER,"He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride."
240249,L449392,u7123,m477,UTAH,Nice place.
240250,L449285,u7123,m477,UTAH,Sure.
240251,L449284,u7122,m477,TYLER,Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
240252,L449282,u7122,m477,TYLER,"Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty."
240253,L449281,u7123,m477,UTAH,"I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth."
240254,L449280,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?"
240255,L449279,u7122,m477,TYLER,This gonna take long?
240256,L449278,u7123,m477,UTAH,"No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--"
240257,L449277,u7122,m477,TYLER,"What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?"
240258,L449276,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck."
240259,L449275,u7122,m477,TYLER,"I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37."
240260,L449274,u7123,m477,UTAH,I'm serious.
240261,L449273,u7122,m477,TYLER,Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
240262,L449272,u7123,m477,UTAH,I need you to teach me.
240263,L449271,u7122,m477,TYLER,"I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here."
240264,L449270,u7123,m477,UTAH,Shrimp and fries.
240265,L449269,u7122,m477,TYLER,What do you want?
240266,L449257,u7124,m477,WOMAN,"Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me."
240267,L449256,u7123,m477,UTAH,Bye.
240268,L449255,u7123,m477,UTAH,"I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him."
240269,L449254,u7124,m477,WOMAN,Who cares!
240270,L449253,u7123,m477,UTAH,My name's Johnny Utah!
240271,L449252,u7124,m477,WOMAN,"Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully."
240272,L449251,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?"
240273,L449250,u7124,m477,WOMAN,"Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!"
240274,L449249,u7123,m477,UTAH,"Well, I saw you and--"
240275,L450227,u7125,m478,BILLY,Something... in the trees...
240276,L450226,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
240277,L450150,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,What about the rest of Hopper's men?
240278,L450149,u7125,m478,BILLY,"I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense."
240279,L450148,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
240280,L450147,u7125,m478,BILLY,"Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions."
240281,L450132,u7125,m478,BILLY,"Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas."
240282,L450131,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,What do you mean?
240283,L450130,u7125,m478,BILLY,"Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there."
240284,L450344,u7126,m478,DILLON,Right behind you.
240285,L450343,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,I'll see you there.
240286,L450340,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,You know you can't win this one.
240287,L450339,u7126,m478,DILLON,"Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along."
240288,L450338,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"This isn't your style, Dillon."
240289,L450337,u7126,m478,DILLON,"No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here."
240290,L450329,u7126,m478,DILLON,"Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?"
240291,L450328,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this."
240292,L450323,u7126,m478,DILLON,"That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait."
240293,L450322,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,We're not going.
240294,L450321,u7126,m478,DILLON,What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
240295,L450320,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,We're going to need everyone.
240296,L450319,u7126,m478,DILLON,What the hell do you think you're doing?
240297,L450311,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,No more games.
240298,L450310,u7126,m478,DILLON,You're wastin' your time.
240299,L450276,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
240300,L450275,u7126,m478,DILLON,"I can accept that, it comes with the job."
240301,L450274,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them."
240302,L450273,u7126,m478,DILLON,"We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us."
240303,L450255,u7126,m478,DILLON,"The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?"
240304,L450254,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel."
240305,L450198,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon."
240306,L450197,u7126,m478,DILLON,She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
240307,L450184,u7126,m478,DILLON,"We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?"
240308,L450183,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,What story did you give to Davis?
240309,L450182,u7126,m478,DILLON,"Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story."
240310,L450181,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Why us?
240311,L450180,u7126,m478,DILLON,"That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to."
240312,L450179,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work."
240313,L450143,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Well somebody sent them.
240314,L450142,u7126,m478,DILLON,Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
240315,L450141,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?"
240316,L450134,u7126,m478,DILLON,Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
240317,L450133,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Mean anything to you?
240318,L450129,u7126,m478,DILLON,They're getting better equipped every day.
240319,L450128,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
240320,L450120,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
240321,L450119,u7126,m478,DILLON,"You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!"
240322,L450113,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,This gets better by the minute.
240323,L450112,u7126,m478,DILLON,"No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own."
240324,L450111,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Who's our back-up on this?
240325,L450110,u7126,m478,DILLON,Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
240326,L450098,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Go on.
240327,L450097,u7126,m478,DILLON,"Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are."
240328,L450096,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?"
240329,L450095,u7126,m478,DILLON,Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
240330,L450094,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"Like the old days, Dillon."
240331,L450093,u7126,m478,DILLON,That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
240332,L450092,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,You never did know when to quit.
240333,L450091,u7126,m478,DILLON,"No way, old buddy."
240334,L450090,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?"
240335,L450356,u7126,m478,DILLON,We both got scores to settle.
240336,L450355,u7127,m478,MAC,"... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro..."
240337,L450354,u7126,m478,DILLON,"Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him..."
240338,L450281,u7127,m478,MAC,"Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range."
240339,L450280,u7126,m478,DILLON,"What, Sergeant?"
240340,L450279,u7127,m478,MAC,"Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes..."
240341,L450212,u7127,m478,MAC,Anytime.
240342,L450211,u7126,m478,DILLON,Thanks.
240343,L450268,u7127,m478,MAC,The best friend I ever had.
240344,L450267,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier."
240345,L450266,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"Thank you, Sergeant."
240346,L450265,u7127,m478,MAC,"We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'."
240347,L450264,u7127,m478,MAC,I'll take him.
240348,L450263,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
240349,L450253,u7127,m478,MAC,I saw it.
240350,L450252,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,You saw what?
240351,L450224,u7127,m478,MAC,"Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there."
240352,L450223,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,What's got Billy so spooked?
240353,L450167,u7127,m478,MAC,"We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here."
240354,L450166,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Any sign of the hostages?
240355,L450084,u7128,m478,PHILIPS,Someone else will be going in with you.
240356,L450083,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"What's that, General?"
240357,L450082,u7128,m478,PHILIPS,You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
240358,L450080,u7128,m478,PHILIPS,"We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time."
240359,L450079,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"What have you got in mind, General."
240360,L450078,u7128,m478,PHILIPS,That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
240361,L450077,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"That's over the border, General."
240362,L450074,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,"It's been a long time, General."
240363,L450073,u7128,m478,PHILIPS,"You're looking well, Dutch."
240364,L450305,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
240365,L450304,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,He knows our defenses.
240366,L450303,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,"How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?"
240367,L450241,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,There's no sign of it.
240368,L450240,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Where the hell is his body?
240369,L450239,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,I think it's Hawkins.
240370,L450238,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,What in God's name...?
240371,L450237,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,I can't tell.
240372,L450236,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Hawkins?
240373,L450235,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,"Major, you'd better take a look at this."
240374,L450137,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,"Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment..."
240375,L450136,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,What's he got?
240376,L450125,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
240377,L450124,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Mmmnnn...?
240378,L450123,u7129,m478,RAMIREZ,"There's something else, Major..."
240379,L450122,u7130,m478,SCHAEFER,Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
240380,L450759,u7131,m479,BRIDGET,"They never are, dear."
240381,L450758,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,He's not really my uncle.
240382,L450757,u7131,m479,BRIDGET,Your uncle will like this.
240383,L450756,u7131,m479,BRIDGET,Philip!  We'll need shoes!
240384,L450755,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?"
240385,L450754,u7131,m479,BRIDGET,You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
240386,L450753,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Well... I might be going out to dinner.
240387,L450752,u7131,m479,BRIDGET,"No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?"
240388,L450751,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Georgia.
240389,L450868,u7132,m479,DAVID,"I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian."
240390,L450867,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
240391,L450866,u7132,m479,DAVID,I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
240392,L450865,u7133,m479,EDWARD,We can reach an understanding on this.
240393,L450850,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot."
240394,L450849,u7132,m479,DAVID,There's no way you could know that.
240395,L450848,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You're not getting any navy contracts.
240396,L450847,u7132,m479,DAVID,We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
240397,L450842,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Twenty-five percent.
240398,L450841,u7132,m479,DAVID,"Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share."
240399,L450996,u7132,m479,DAVID,I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
240400,L450995,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You don't know anything about me.
240401,L450994,u7132,m479,DAVID,I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
240402,L450993,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It's... it's not like that.
240403,L450992,u7132,m479,DAVID,Hope to be?
240404,L450991,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,No.
240405,L450990,u7132,m479,DAVID,"Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?"
240406,L450989,u7132,m479,DAVID,Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
240407,L450988,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Please, we hardly know each other."
240408,L450987,u7132,m479,DAVID,"Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder."
240409,L450986,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
240410,L450985,u7132,m479,DAVID,I like your hat.
240411,L451190,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Who indeed...
240412,L451189,u7134,m479,JAKE,"Who are you going after next, sir?"
240413,L451188,u7134,m479,JAKE,Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
240414,L451187,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What?
240415,L451186,u7134,m479,JAKE,"Congratulations, sir."
240416,L450735,u7134,m479,JAKE,I talked to some developers about the land.
240417,L450734,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You what?
240418,L450733,u7134,m479,JAKE,"The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --"
240419,L450731,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Not with those smokestacks it's not.
240420,L450730,u7134,m479,JAKE,"Storage, I think."
240421,L450729,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What's that long building over there?
240422,L451215,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
240423,L451214,u7136,m479,KROSS,"You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris."
240424,L451213,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?"
240425,L451212,u7136,m479,KROSS,Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
240426,L451208,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that."
240427,L451207,u7136,m479,KROSS,I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
240428,L451206,u7133,m479,EDWARD,How?
240429,L451205,u7136,m479,KROSS,I... I would take advantage of it.
240430,L451202,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"If you had a... reprieve, what would do?"
240431,L451201,u7136,m479,KROSS,Yes.
240432,L451200,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?"
240433,L451136,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You're making the right decision, sir."
240434,L451135,u7136,m479,KROSS,"Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid."
240435,L451134,u7133,m479,EDWARD,<u>Expected</u>... offer.
240436,L451133,u7136,m479,KROSS,Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
240437,L451128,u7136,m479,KROSS,Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
240438,L451127,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"How are you, Mr. Kross."
240439,L451126,u7136,m479,KROSS,Mr. Harris.
240440,L450860,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you."
240441,L450859,u7136,m479,KROSS,I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
240442,L450858,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
240443,L450857,u7136,m479,KROSS,"I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks."
240444,L450856,u7133,m479,EDWARD,No.  What I have is a lot of money.
240445,L450855,u7136,m479,KROSS,You've got a lot of nerve.
240446,L450854,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours."
240447,L450846,u7133,m479,EDWARD,To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
240448,L450845,u7136,m479,KROSS,What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
240449,L451256,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
240450,L451255,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Vivian...
240451,L451254,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I didn't think so.
240452,L451253,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?"
240453,L451252,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
240454,L451251,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Aw, don't... no..."
240455,L451250,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please."
240456,L451249,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You're packing.
240457,L451248,u7133,m479,EDWARD,It felt good.
240458,L451247,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It was good.
240459,L451246,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I got tired of hating my father.
240460,L451245,u7133,m479,EDWARD,It was a business decision.
240461,L451244,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross."
240462,L451243,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
240463,L451242,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!"
240464,L451153,u7133,m479,EDWARD,It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
240465,L451152,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
240466,L451151,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Yes.  The man made a business decision.
240467,L451150,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Business.
240468,L451149,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all."
240469,L451148,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Right.
240470,L451147,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated."
240471,L451146,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
240472,L451145,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What do you mean?
240473,L451144,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What did you do to him?
240474,L451125,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You just did.
240475,L451124,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I've never treated you like a whore.
240476,L451123,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore."
240477,L451122,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, life's not a fairy tale."
240478,L451121,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, ""Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."""
240479,L451120,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution."
240480,L451119,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it..."
240481,L451118,u7133,m479,EDWARD,It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
240482,L451117,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
240483,L451116,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I have to go to New York tomorrow.
240484,L451115,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take."
240485,L451114,u7133,m479,EDWARD,One more night and you're finally rid of me.
240486,L451101,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
240487,L451100,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Did you?
240488,L451099,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I know.  I'm glad.
240489,L451098,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I more than liked it.
240490,L451097,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you."
240491,L451091,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it."
240492,L451090,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,But don't they have it in English?
240493,L451089,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
240494,L451088,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?"
240495,L451082,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What happened to him?
240496,L451081,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff."
240497,L451080,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
240498,L451079,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
240499,L451075,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these."
240500,L451074,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I've never been on a plane before.
240501,L451073,u7133,m479,EDWARD,The opera.
240502,L451072,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Huh?
240503,L451071,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker..."
240504,L451070,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Where are you taking me!?
240505,L451069,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't."
240506,L451065,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'll guard them and you with my life.
240507,L451064,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What if someone tries to steal it?
240508,L451063,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You won't.
240509,L451062,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What if I lose it?
240510,L451061,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Shush.  Of course you can.
240511,L451060,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Edward, I can't."
240512,L451058,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
240513,L451057,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What's that?
240514,L451056,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing."
240515,L451055,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Do I look okay?
240516,L451044,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I really am sorry.
240517,L451043,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off."
240518,L451042,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
240519,L451041,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up."
240520,L451040,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Fuck off.
240521,L451039,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
240522,L451038,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
240523,L451037,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Vivian...
240524,L451036,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone."
240525,L451035,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money."
240526,L451034,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
240527,L451033,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
240528,L451032,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
240529,L451031,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Stuckey!  He wants an ""appointment"" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?"
240530,L451030,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
240531,L451029,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
240532,L451028,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I don't know what you're talking about.
240533,L451027,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!"
240534,L451026,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, what the --"
240535,L451025,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
240536,L450982,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Ready to stomp sod?
240537,L450981,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
240538,L450980,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'm sure that's true for some of them.
240539,L450979,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money."
240540,L450966,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Shall we mingle?
240541,L450965,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
240542,L450964,u7133,m479,EDWARD,He's good at what he does.
240543,L450963,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Real genuine guy.
240544,L450955,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You did.
240545,L450954,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
240546,L450953,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What id we run into someone I know?
240547,L450952,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I think it's exciting.
240548,L450951,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You're really pushing it, bringing me here."
240549,L450946,u7133,m479,EDWARD,He died a long time ago.
240550,L450945,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You still mad at'm?
240551,L450944,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
240552,L450943,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
240553,L450942,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him."
240554,L450941,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?"
240555,L450940,u7133,m479,EDWARD,No.
240556,L450939,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You always been rich?
240557,L450938,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Dinner can wait.
240558,L450937,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What about dinner?
240559,L450936,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Please.
240560,L450935,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
240561,L450934,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
240562,L450933,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
240563,L450896,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Come with me?
240564,L450895,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Good.
240565,L450894,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Okay.
240566,L450893,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you."
240567,L450892,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
240568,L450891,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Was someone rude to you?
240569,L450890,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works."
240570,L450889,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Why not?
240571,L450888,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
240572,L450887,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
240573,L450885,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Uh-uh.  No work.
240574,L450884,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I have work to do.
240575,L450883,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all."
240576,L450882,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Television?
240577,L450881,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
240578,L450879,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all..."
240579,L450878,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
240580,L450877,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You liked the guy, though."
240581,L450876,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
240582,L450875,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You're upset, huh?"
240583,L450870,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
240584,L450869,u7133,m479,EDWARD,And that's the way the game is played.
240585,L450838,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You're forgiven.
240586,L450837,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'm sorry.
240587,L450784,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Oooh!
240588,L450783,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
240589,L450782,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Hello?
240590,L450781,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Thank you <u>very much</u>.
240591,L450780,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
240592,L450779,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I think you'll approve.
240593,L450778,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Any good?
240594,L450777,u7133,m479,EDWARD,The Rex.
240595,L450776,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
240596,L450775,u7133,m479,EDWARD,This isn't a date.
240597,L450774,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No, I don't ""got it"".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date."
240598,L450773,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
240599,L450772,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
240600,L450771,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
240601,L450770,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I got a dress, yeah."
240602,L450769,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Did you buy some clothes?
240603,L450768,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time."
240604,L450767,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Never answer the phone.  Ever.
240605,L450671,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go."
240606,L450670,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?"
240607,L450669,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'm not just talking about sex.
240608,L450668,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Holy shit.
240609,L450667,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Done.
240610,L450666,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Three.
240611,L450665,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"All right, two thousand."
240612,L450664,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,But you want days too.
240613,L450663,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500."
240614,L450662,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Four thousand.
240615,L450661,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Five full nights... days too?
240616,L450660,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Of course.  How much?
240617,L450659,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It'd cost you.
240618,L450657,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'm in town until Saturday.
240619,L450656,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What?
240620,L450655,u7133,m479,EDWARD,All right.  How much for the week?
240621,L450644,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Don't drown.
240622,L450643,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
240623,L450642,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Where'd you learn to do this?
240624,L450641,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot."
240625,L450640,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Not... quite.
240626,L450639,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?"
240627,L450638,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit."
240628,L450637,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"C'mon, I might buy a company some day."
240629,L450636,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Vivian --
240630,L450635,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What are assets?
240631,L450634,u7133,m479,EDWARD,By breaking up a company's assets --
240632,L450633,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What?  Why?
240633,L450632,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I sell them.
240634,L450631,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
240635,L450630,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,... dollars?
240636,L450629,u7133,m479,EDWARD,The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
240637,L450628,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,No shit.  They expensive?
240638,L450627,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I buy companies.
240639,L450626,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"""Occupational hazard""."
240640,L450625,u7133,m479,EDWARD,No?  Why's that?
240641,L450624,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
240642,L450623,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Do you ever... enjoy it?
240643,L450622,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'd say you give a good dollar value.
240644,L450621,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
240645,L450620,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Mmm, I could tell."
240646,L450619,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself."
240647,L450618,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
240648,L450617,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Where'd you go?
240649,L450616,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Occupational hazard?
240650,L450615,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
240651,L450614,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Did you sleep well?
240652,L450612,u7133,m479,EDWARD,No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
240653,L450611,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
240654,L450610,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Good morning.
240655,L450599,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
240656,L450598,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What do you like?
240657,L450596,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Yes...
240658,L450595,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Just a romantic, that's you."
240659,L450594,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You really are a very beautiful girl.
240660,L450593,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
240661,L450592,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club."
240662,L450591,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
240663,L450590,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Why?
240664,L450589,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Try a strawberry.
240665,L450588,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Oooh, thank god."
240666,L450587,u7133,m479,EDWARD,It's a very good year.
240667,L450586,u7133,m479,EDWARD,They should be.  They're both good at it.
240668,L450585,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Where are they?  Shopping together?
240669,L450583,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred."
240670,L450582,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I think he wanted you to tip him.
240671,L450575,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I've known a lot of everybody.
240672,L450574,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
240673,L450573,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look."
240674,L450572,u7133,m479,EDWARD,And why do you say that?
240675,L450571,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Let me guess, you're a... lawyer."
240676,L450570,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Uh-huh.
240677,L450569,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Right.  So!  In town on business?
240678,L450568,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Let's talk some more first.
240679,L450567,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Fair enough.
240680,L450566,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance."
240681,L450565,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Always.
240682,L450564,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Do you plan everything?
240683,L450563,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
240684,L450560,u7133,m479,EDWARD,-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
240685,L450559,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Can I have some chips?
240686,L450558,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
240687,L450557,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Diet coke.
240688,L450556,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Room service.  What do you drink?
240689,L450549,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Exactly.
240690,L450548,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Off the boulevard.
240691,L450547,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're..."
240692,L450546,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You mean they don't have hookers.
240693,L450545,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
240694,L450544,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Why?
240695,L450543,u7133,m479,EDWARD,My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
240696,L450541,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
240697,L450540,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Better believe it.
240698,L450539,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You know how to drive a stick?
240699,L450538,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What?
240700,L450537,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Get in.  This side.
240701,L450536,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Edward... you got it!
240702,L450535,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Edward.  My name is Edward.
240703,L450534,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What's your name, lover."
240704,L450533,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Fine.
240705,L450532,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Three hundred.
240706,L450530,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You couldn't afford it.
240707,L450529,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?"
240708,L450528,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No, but it's getting there."
240709,L450527,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
240710,L450526,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I never joke about money.
240711,L450525,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You're joking.
240712,L450524,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,For an hour.
240713,L450523,u7133,m479,EDWARD,For the whole night?
240714,L450522,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
240715,L450521,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What do you charge for company, Vivian?"
240716,L450519,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You don't know habits, you think this is ugly."
240717,L450518,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Ugly habit, biting your nails."
240718,L450517,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to."
240719,L450516,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"If you're making fun of me, I don't like it."
240720,L450515,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
240721,L450514,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer."
240722,L450513,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
240723,L450512,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right."
240724,L450511,u7133,m479,EDWARD,So do day jobs.
240725,L450510,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It pays.
240726,L450509,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You like being a hooker, Vivian?"
240727,L450508,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian."
240728,L450507,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What's your name?
240729,L450506,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break."
240730,L450505,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
240731,L450504,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?"
240732,L450503,u7133,m479,EDWARD,<u>Ho</u>tel.
240733,L450502,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What motel you staying at?
240734,L450501,u7133,m479,EDWARD,New York.
240735,L450500,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You're not from L.A., huh?"
240736,L450499,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
240737,L450498,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"If you can figure it out, be my guest."
240738,L450497,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Mind if I turn on some heat?
240739,L450496,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Not exactly.
240740,L450495,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Stolen?
240741,L450494,u7133,m479,EDWARD,No.
240742,L450493,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Nice car.  Yours?
240743,L450490,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
240744,L450489,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Sit... and spin.
240745,L450488,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
240746,L450487,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,The price just went up to ten.
240747,L450486,u7133,m479,EDWARD,That's ridiculous.
240748,L450485,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Sure.  For five bucks.
240749,L450484,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
240750,L450483,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk."
240751,L450482,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No, you look like a hooker."
240752,L450481,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
240753,L450480,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Yes.
240754,L450479,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
240755,L450478,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?"
240756,L450477,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You looking' for some company?
240757,L450476,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What's that?
240758,L450475,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?"
240759,L451053,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Afternoon.
240760,L451052,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Good afternoon, Mr. Harris."
240761,L450834,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Thank you.
240762,L450833,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge."
240763,L450831,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,The young lady staying in your room?
240764,L450830,u7133,m479,EDWARD,My what?
240765,L450829,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"I have a message for you from your ""niece"", sir."
240766,L450828,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --"
240767,L450827,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel."
240768,L451239,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Yes.
240769,L451238,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,All this because of that whore!
240770,L451237,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!"
240771,L451236,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Edward, we've been together ten years."
240772,L451235,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
240773,L451234,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,You broke my nose.
240774,L451217,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Have a good day, gentlemen."
240775,L451216,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,What!?
240776,L451211,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Have you lost your mind?
240777,L451210,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?"
240778,L451209,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Oh, my god... Edward, no!"
240779,L451204,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Let him answer.
240780,L451203,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,I don't think there's any sense in --
240781,L451110,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning."
240782,L451109,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Give me twenty minutes.
240783,L451108,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
240784,L451107,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Why?
240785,L451106,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
240786,L451105,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'm up.
240787,L451104,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Did I wake you?
240788,L451050,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Goodbye, Bill."
240789,L451049,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
240790,L451048,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
240791,L451047,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
240792,L451012,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard."
240793,L451011,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?"
240794,L451010,u7133,m479,EDWARD,You're being ridiculous.
240795,L451009,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient."
240796,L451008,u7133,m479,EDWARD,She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
240797,L451007,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
240798,L451006,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Why do you want to know?
240799,L451005,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?"
240800,L451004,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Vivian's in sales.
240801,L451003,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Doing what?
240802,L451002,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Yes...
240803,L451001,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
240804,L451000,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions."
240805,L450999,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this."
240806,L450998,u7133,m479,EDWARD,We just did.
240807,L450997,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
240808,L450959,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth."
240809,L450958,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian."
240810,L450930,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed."
240811,L450929,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money."
240812,L450928,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --"
240813,L450913,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Do it.
240814,L450912,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"But, Edward..."
240815,L450911,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
240816,L450910,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,We're letting them slide?
240817,L450909,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
240818,L450908,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
240819,L450907,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
240820,L450906,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
240821,L450749,u7133,m479,EDWARD,No one you know.
240822,L450748,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?"
240823,L450747,u7133,m479,EDWARD,What time's diner tonight?
240824,L450742,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?"
240825,L450741,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,What!?
240826,L450653,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,I know a lot of nice girls.
240827,L450652,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'm here.
240828,L450651,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Edward, did you hear me?"
240829,L450609,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'll bring it back.
240830,L450608,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Oh, god, what?"
240831,L450607,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car..."
240832,L450606,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
240833,L450605,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
240834,L450604,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal."
240835,L450603,u7133,m479,EDWARD,I want to.
240836,L450420,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
240837,L450419,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Love this car!  Is it new?
240838,L450415,u7133,m479,EDWARD,No.
240839,L450414,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,Cynthia's not coming?
240840,L450413,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one."
240841,L450412,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you..."
240842,L450411,u7133,m479,EDWARD,Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
240843,L450410,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
240844,L450409,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel."
240845,L450408,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"What's up, where you going?"
240846,L451295,u7135,m479,KIT,"I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day."
240847,L451294,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away."
240848,L451293,u7135,m479,KIT,"No.  You took care of rent, that's enough."
240849,L451292,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
240850,L451291,u7135,m479,KIT,Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
240851,L451290,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Couple a hours.
240852,L451289,u7135,m479,KIT,And leave all this?  Not in a million.
240853,L451288,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You sure you won't come with me?
240854,L451287,u7135,m479,KIT,Do I!?  Momma!
240855,L451286,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Want a pair of boots?
240856,L451285,u7135,m479,KIT,"So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a ""B.""  Lift your dress and an ""A"" you'll see."
240857,L451284,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know."
240858,L451283,u7135,m479,KIT,What kind of school?
240859,L451282,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
240860,L451281,u7135,m479,KIT,So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
240861,L451185,u7135,m479,KIT,"Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart."
240862,L451184,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
240863,L451183,u7135,m479,KIT,Go for the bucks.
240864,L451182,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?"
240865,L451181,u7135,m479,KIT,I pray for that.
240866,L451180,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money."
240867,L451179,u7135,m479,KIT,Dummy.
240868,L451178,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,It was great.
240869,L451177,u7135,m479,KIT,"Oh, my god, you mean it was good?"
240870,L451176,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
240871,L451175,u7135,m479,KIT,"Honey, you're not supposed to do that."
240872,L451174,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth."
240873,L451173,u7135,m479,KIT,Where do you fit?
240874,L451172,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
240875,L451171,u7135,m479,KIT,"What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway."
240876,L451170,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Yeah... I know what you mean.
240877,L451169,u7135,m479,KIT,Everybody keeps starin' at me.
240878,L451168,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Kit...
240879,L451166,u7135,m479,KIT,Yeah.  I just got it.
240880,L451165,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Kit, I left that money for you days ago."
240881,L451164,u7135,m479,KIT,Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
240882,L451163,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Who did you think?
240883,L451162,u7135,m479,KIT,Was that you?
240884,L451161,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling."
240885,L450693,u7135,m479,KIT,Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
240886,L450692,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Yeah.
240887,L450691,u7135,m479,KIT,In Beverly Hills?
240888,L450690,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>."
240889,L450689,u7135,m479,KIT,I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
240890,L450688,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out."
240891,L450687,u7135,m479,KIT,"I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?"
240892,L450686,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,He... he just does.
240893,L450685,u7135,m479,KIT,Why'd he want you?
240894,L450684,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?"
240895,L450683,u7135,m479,KIT,I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
240896,L450682,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Kit!  Where've you been?
240897,L450681,u7135,m479,KIT,'Lo.
240898,L450470,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,He's not gonna want us.
240899,L450469,u7135,m479,KIT,"Hey, hey -- There's a rent."
240900,L450468,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
240901,L450467,u7135,m479,KIT,I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
240902,L450466,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
240903,L450465,u7135,m479,KIT,Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
240904,L450464,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Looks slow tonight.
240905,L450460,u7135,m479,KIT,Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
240906,L450459,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No, let's go to work.  Okay?"
240907,L450458,u7135,m479,KIT,"I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?"
240908,L450457,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
240909,L450456,u7135,m479,KIT,Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
240910,L450455,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
240911,L450454,u7135,m479,KIT,Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
240912,L450453,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street."
240913,L450445,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I bet.  That was our rent!
240914,L450444,u7135,m479,KIT,Carlos had some great rock.
240915,L450441,u7135,m479,KIT,"Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv."
240916,L450440,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You spent it on drugs, didn't you?"
240917,L450428,u7137,m479,LANDLORD,Of rent I do not bullshit.
240918,L450427,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You bullshittin' me?
240919,L450426,u7137,m479,LANDLORD,Kit give me nothin'.
240920,L450425,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash."
240921,L450424,u7137,m479,LANDLORD,Rent.  You're late.
240922,L450423,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, what?"
240923,L450794,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?"
240924,L450793,u7138,m479,MAID,"I leave extras, miss."
240925,L450792,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Oooh, I love those."
240926,L450791,u7138,m479,MAID,I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
240927,L450790,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
240928,L450788,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Okay.
240929,L450787,u7138,m479,MAID,<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
240930,L450786,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What?
240931,L450785,u7138,m479,MAID,"Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed."
240932,L451267,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon."
240933,L451266,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas."
240934,L451265,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,You're not accompanying him to New York?
240935,L451264,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, well, I check out today."
240936,L451263,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
240937,L451262,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
240938,L451261,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,Miss Vivian.
240939,L451260,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hi, Barney!"
240940,L451159,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own."
240941,L451158,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Me?
240942,L451157,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you."
240943,L450821,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Professionally?
240944,L450820,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?"
240945,L450819,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands."
240946,L450818,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,Miss Vivian --
240947,L450817,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Steak spoon!
240948,L450816,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,Then you would use your--
240949,L450815,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I like steak.
240950,L450814,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
240951,L450813,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,But what if they serve soup?
240952,L450812,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,They will serve salad.
240953,L450811,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What if they serve soup?
240954,L450810,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork."
240955,L450809,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Hmmm... I vonder vich.
240956,L450808,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,Either you're European or badly brought up.
240957,L450807,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,But I always eat like this.
240958,L450806,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand."
240959,L450803,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best."
240960,L450802,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,You'll like it fine.
240961,L450801,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Will I like it?
240962,L450800,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,I think you'll find it normal enough.
240963,L450799,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?"
240964,L450798,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say."
240965,L450797,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
240966,L450796,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"What is it, Miss Vivian?"
240967,L450764,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney."
240968,L450763,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
240969,L450762,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
240970,L450761,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
240971,L450760,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I got a dress.
240972,L450723,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,"Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again."
240973,L450722,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Niece?
240974,L450721,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
240975,L450720,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Vivian.
240976,L450719,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,What's your name?
240977,L450712,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I... Edward...
240978,L450711,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,And who is that?
240979,L450710,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I'm -- I'm with a friend.
240980,L450709,u7139,m479,MR. THOMAS,You're a guest here?
240981,L450708,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I'm just going to my room.
240982,L450924,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I was in here yesterday.
240983,L450923,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,"No, I'm sorry, I don't."
240984,L450922,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Do you remember me?
240985,L450921,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,Yes?
240986,L450920,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,'Scume me.
240987,L450919,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,Would you like to try it on?
240988,L450706,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
240989,L450705,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
240990,L450704,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,Excuse me?
240991,L450703,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What is with you?
240992,L450702,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,It's very expensive.
240993,L450701,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
240994,L450700,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,I don't think it would fit you.
240995,L450699,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
240996,L450698,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,Yes...
240997,L450697,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Yes.  Something... conservative.
240998,L450696,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,Are you looking for something in particular?
240999,L450695,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm just looking, thanks."
241000,L450694,u7140,m479,SALESWOMAN,May I help you?
241001,L451231,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?"
241002,L451230,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Get out!
241003,L451228,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business."
241004,L451227,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
241005,L451226,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,I think it's great.
241006,L451225,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities."
241007,L451023,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,I just might do that.
241008,L451022,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
241009,L451021,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
241010,L451020,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,What?
241011,L451019,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
241012,L451018,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,Yeah.  Thanks.
241013,L451017,u7141,m479,STUCKEY,"Having a good time, Vivian?"
241014,L451722,u7143,m480,ALBINO,You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
241015,L451721,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,You don't believe me?
241016,L451719,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,So it's to be torture.
241017,L451718,u7143,m480,ALBINO,The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
241018,L451717,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Then why bother curing me?
241019,L451716,u7143,m480,ALBINO,Till they kill you. Yeah.
241020,L451715,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Then I'm here till I die?
241021,L451714,u7143,m480,ALBINO,"Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out."
241022,L451993,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
241023,L451992,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I killed him myself.
241024,L451969,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,I do not marry tonight.
241025,L451968,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"Brides often are, I'm told."
241026,L451967,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Should I be?
241027,L451966,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"You don't seem excited, my little muffin."
241028,L451824,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth."
241029,L451823,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
241030,L451822,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear."
241031,L451821,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,You're a silly girl.
241032,L451820,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
241033,L451818,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four."
241034,L451817,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Every ship but the four you sent.
241035,L451816,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Every ship but your four fastest, you mean."
241036,L451815,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon."
241037,L451770,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,Of course.
241038,L451769,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,He will come for me.
241039,L451749,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?"
241040,L451748,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,My Westley will always come for me.
241041,L451703,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I swear it will be done.
241042,L451702,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"He is a sailor on the pirate ship ""Revenge."" Promise to return him to his ship."
241043,L451701,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
241044,L451700,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?"
241045,L451645,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?"
241046,L451644,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,... as ... you ... wish...
241047,L451642,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!"
241048,L451641,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?"
241049,L451640,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,And what am I?
241050,L451639,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"I asked him what was so important for him. ""True love,"" he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are."
241051,L451638,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, ""Please. Please, I need to live."" It was the ""please"" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53."
241052,L451637,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Nothing you can say will upset me.
241053,L451636,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Does it bother you to hear?
241054,L451635,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?"
241055,L451634,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,You mock my pain!
241056,L451633,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time."
241057,L451632,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners."
241058,L451628,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?"
241059,L451627,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
241060,L451626,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,With pride. What can I do for you?
241061,L451625,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
241062,L451624,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
241063,L451623,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Rest, Highness."
241064,L451619,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
241065,L451618,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"""Are not capable of love"" is what you mean."
241066,L451617,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,He knows I do not love him.
241067,L451616,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
241068,L451615,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know."
241069,L451614,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
241070,L451613,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
241071,L451612,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness."
241072,L451611,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you..."
241073,L451610,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Catch your breath.
241074,L451607,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
241075,L451606,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
241076,L451605,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know."
241077,L451604,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Who are you?
241078,L452050,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?"
241079,L452049,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Well, no, we sort of skipped that part."
241080,L452048,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Did you say, ""I do""?"
241081,L452047,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"But it did. I was there. This old man said, ""Man and wife."""
241082,L452046,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
241083,L452045,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,What?
241084,L452044,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,It never happened.
241085,L452043,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
241086,L452042,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,What hideous sin have you committed lately?
241087,L452041,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?"
241088,L452023,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Gently!!
241089,L452022,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"At a time like this that's all you can think to say? ""Gently?"""
241090,L452021,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Gently.
241091,L452020,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?"
241092,L451687,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64."
241093,L451686,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,We did it.
241094,L451683,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
241095,L451682,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?"
241096,L451681,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too."
241097,L451680,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,No. No. We have already succeeded.
241098,L451679,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
241099,L451674,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,What? -- go on --
241100,L451673,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, ""All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" Three years he said that. ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened."
241101,L451671,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
241102,L451670,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?"
241103,L451669,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship ""Revenge"" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts."
241104,L451667,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
241105,L451666,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Singed a bit, were you?"
241106,L451663,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
241107,L451662,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,We'll never survive.
241108,L451654,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,There will never be a need.
241109,L451653,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,I will never doubt again.
241110,L451652,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
241111,L451651,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Well ... you were dead.
241112,L451650,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"I told you, ""I would always come for you."" Why didn't you wait for me?"
241113,L451649,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,"Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly."
241114,L451648,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Can you move at all?
241115,L451358,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,This is true love. You think this happens every day?
241116,L451357,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,But how can you be sure?
241117,L451356,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Hear this now: I will come for you.
241118,L451355,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,But what if something happens to you?
241119,L451354,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Of course you will.
241120,L451353,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,I fear I'll never see you again.
241121,L451339,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,As you wish.
241122,L451338,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
241123,L451336,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,As you wish.
241124,L451335,u7144,m480,BUTTERCUP,Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
241125,L451549,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one."
241126,L451548,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Why should that make such a difference?
241127,L451546,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing."
241128,L451545,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Why is that, do you think?"
241129,L451542,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39."
241130,L451541,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,And a good thing too.
241131,L451540,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,You're quick.
241132,L451539,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
241133,L451538,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
241134,L451537,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
241135,L451536,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting."
241136,L451535,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I could kill you now.
241137,L451534,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?"
241138,L451533,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone."
241139,L451532,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,I believe you -- So what happens now?
241140,L451531,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
241141,L451527,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?"
241142,L451526,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Finish him, finish him. Your way."
241143,L451525,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,What do I do?
241144,L451524,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
241145,L451457,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,I'm waiting!
241146,L451456,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
241147,L451445,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Don't say that, Vizzini. Please."
241148,L451444,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all."
241149,L451443,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself."
241150,L451442,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains."
241151,L451441,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I thought I was going faster.
241152,L451440,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,Faster!
241153,L451413,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,Veer left. Left. Left!
241154,L451412,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I only dog paddle.
241155,L451397,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Anybody want a peanut?
241156,L451396,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"No more rhymes now, I mean it."
241157,L451382,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Am I going mad or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass."
241158,L451381,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl."
241159,L451380,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
241160,L451379,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,You never said anything about killing anyone.
241161,L451378,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed."
241162,L451377,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
241163,L451376,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Who's Guilder?
241164,L451375,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
241165,L452009,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I'll be right back.
241166,L452008,u7148,m480,INIGO,"He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!"
241167,L451965,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I hope we win...
241168,L451964,u7148,m480,INIGO,What?
241169,L451963,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Inigo.
241170,L451962,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Right, right, sorry."
241171,L451961,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Don't pester him, he's had a hard day."
241172,L451955,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it."
241173,L451954,u7148,m480,INIGO,Where did you get that?
241174,L451953,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Will this do?
241175,L451950,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Over the Albino, I think."
241176,L451949,u7148,m480,INIGO,Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
241177,L451934,u7148,m480,INIGO,We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
241178,L451933,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,You've been mostly dead all day.
241179,L451928,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
241180,L451927,u7148,m480,INIGO,Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
241181,L451926,u7148,m480,INIGO,We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
241182,L451925,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Has it been fifteen minutes?
241183,L451924,u7148,m480,INIGO,What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
241184,L451923,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
241185,L451861,u7148,m480,INIGO,"I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91."
241186,L451860,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I have a little.
241187,L451859,u7148,m480,INIGO,Have you any money?
241188,L451858,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,The body?
241189,L451857,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body."
241190,L451835,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Everybody ... MOVE!!
241191,L451834,u7148,m480,INIGO,"-- Fezzik, please --"
241192,L451832,u7148,m480,INIGO,"His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --"
241193,L451831,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,The Man in Black?
241194,L451808,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace."
241195,L451807,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,But you don't know where he is.
241196,L451806,u7148,m480,INIGO,"To find the Man in Black, obviously."
241197,L451805,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,-- where?
241198,L451804,u7148,m480,INIGO,"-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --"
241199,L451803,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,-- what? --
241200,L451802,u7148,m480,INIGO,No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
241201,L451800,u7148,m480,INIGO,"That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82."
241202,L451799,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,I don't think more than ten.
241203,L451798,u7148,m480,INIGO,How many could you handle?
241204,L451797,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
241205,L451793,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Yeah?
241206,L451792,u7148,m480,INIGO,Perhaps not. I feel fine.
241207,L451791,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
241208,L451790,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,True!
241209,L451789,u7148,m480,INIGO,It's you.
241210,L451788,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,Hello.
241211,L451395,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"If there are, we'll all be dead."
241212,L451394,u7148,m480,INIGO,"FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?"
241213,L451392,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,"Yes, some of the time."
241214,L451391,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme."
241215,L451390,u7145,m480,FEZZIK,He's really very short on charm.
241216,L451389,u7148,m480,INIGO,Probably he means no harm.
241217,L452098,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,As you wish...
241218,L452097,u7153,m480,THE KID,Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
241219,L452095,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
241220,L452094,u7153,m480,THE KID,Okay.
241221,L452093,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
241222,L452090,u7153,m480,THE KID,I don't mind so much.
241223,L452089,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it."
241224,L452088,u7153,m480,THE KID,What? What?
241225,L451856,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair."
241226,L451855,u7153,m480,THE KID,No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
241227,L451852,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
241228,L451851,u7153,m480,THE KID,"Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?"
241229,L451850,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,I don't understand.
241230,L451849,u7153,m480,THE KID,Who gets Humperdinck?
241231,L451848,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,You want me to read this or not?
241232,L451847,u7153,m480,THE KID,"Westley's only faking, right?"
241233,L451743,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up."
241234,L451742,u7153,m480,THE KID,See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
241235,L451741,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse."
241236,L451734,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen."
241237,L451733,u7153,m480,THE KID,Yes.
241238,L451732,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Do you want me to go on with this?
241239,L451731,u7153,m480,THE KID,"I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!"
241240,L451730,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair."
241241,L451729,u7153,m480,THE KID,"You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair."
241242,L451660,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor."
241243,L451659,u7153,m480,THE KID,Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
241244,L451658,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"Someday, you may not mind so much."
241245,L451657,u7153,m480,THE KID,"They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?"
241246,L451656,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
241247,L451655,u7153,m480,THE KID,"Oh no. No, please."
241248,L451422,u7153,m480,THE KID,No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
241249,L451421,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Because I can stop now if you want.
241250,L451420,u7153,m480,THE KID,"Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing."
241251,L451419,u7153,m480,THE KID,"Well, I wasn't nervous."
241252,L451418,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
241253,L451417,u7153,m480,THE KID,What?
241254,L451360,u7153,m480,THE KID,-- murdered by pirates is good --
241255,L451359,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --"
241256,L451352,u7153,m480,THE KID,I don't be-leeve this.
241257,L451351,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
241258,L451349,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
241259,L451348,u7153,m480,THE KID,"-- well, when does it get good?"
241260,L451347,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"-- wait, just wait --"
241261,L451346,u7153,m480,THE KID,What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
241262,L451345,u7153,m480,THE KID,"-hold it, hold it-"
241263,L451333,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
241264,L451332,u7153,m480,THE KID,Yeah. It's really good.
241265,L451331,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?"
241266,L451330,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin."
241267,L451329,u7153,m480,THE KID,It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
241268,L451327,u7153,m480,THE KID,Has it got any sports in it?
241269,L451326,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,"That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you."
241270,L451325,u7153,m480,THE KID,A book?
241271,L451324,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,Open it up.
241272,L451323,u7153,m480,THE KID,What is it?
241273,L451322,u7146,m480,GRANDFATHER,I brought you a special present.
241274,L451814,u7157,m480,YELLIN,"The gate has but one key, and I carry that."
241275,L451813,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,Double it. My Princess must be safe.
241276,L451812,u7157,m480,YELLIN,The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
241277,L451811,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,Rise and report.
241278,L451775,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,Try ruling the world sometime.
241279,L451774,u7157,m480,YELLIN,"It won't be easy, Sire."
241280,L451773,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
241281,L451772,u7157,m480,YELLIN,Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
241282,L451771,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested."
241283,L451766,u7157,m480,YELLIN,My spy network has heard no such news.
241284,L451765,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night."
241285,L451764,u7157,m480,YELLIN,Sire.
241286,L451763,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,Yellin.
241287,L452061,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --"
241288,L452060,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it"
241289,L452059,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --"
241290,L452058,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight."
241291,L452055,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
241292,L452054,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon."
241293,L452053,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
241294,L452052,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,No.  To the pain.
241295,L452051,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
241296,L451696,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,DEATH FIRST!!
241297,L451695,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,For the last time -- SURRENDER!
241298,L451693,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,It will not happen!
241299,L451692,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I tell you once again -- surrender!
241300,L451691,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit."
241301,L451690,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
241302,L451689,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept."
241303,L451754,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75."
241304,L451753,u7152,m480,RUGEN,"Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight."
241305,L451752,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war."
241306,L451751,u7152,m480,RUGEN,"Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable."
241307,L451747,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words."
241308,L451746,u7152,m480,RUGEN,Yes.
241309,L451745,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
241310,L451724,u7152,m480,RUGEN,Of course.
241311,L451723,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
241312,L451705,u7152,m480,RUGEN,I swear it will be done.
241313,L451704,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,"Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair."
241314,L451557,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
241315,L451556,u7152,m480,RUGEN,Could this be a trap?
241316,L451555,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
241317,L451554,u7152,m480,RUGEN,Shall we track them both?
241318,L451553,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
241319,L451552,u7152,m480,RUGEN,Who won? How did it end?
241320,L451551,u7147,m480,HUMPERDINCK,There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
241321,L452086,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
241322,L452085,u7148,m480,INIGO,"You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life."
241323,L452073,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,In that case --
241324,L452072,u7148,m480,INIGO,No.
241325,L452071,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,I thought he was with you.
241326,L452070,u7148,m480,INIGO,Where's Fezzik?
241327,L451981,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Light him.
241328,L451980,u7148,m480,INIGO,Now?
241329,L451978,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Not yet.
241330,L451977,u7148,m480,INIGO,Now?
241331,L451960,u7148,m480,INIGO,"I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --"
241332,L451959,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside."
241333,L451958,u7148,m480,INIGO,Why? You can't even lift one.
241334,L451952,u7148,m480,INIGO,There we cannot help you.
241335,L451951,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,"Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak."
241336,L451944,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel."
241337,L451943,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,And our assets?
241338,L451942,u7148,m480,INIGO,And it is guarded by sixty men.
241339,L451938,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
241340,L451937,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen."
241341,L451936,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99."
241342,L451935,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
241343,L451930,u7156,m480,WESTLEY,I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
241344,L451929,u7148,m480,INIGO,Your guess is as good as mine --
241345,L452039,u7148,m480,INIGO,"I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!"
241346,L452038,u7152,m480,RUGEN,-- anything you want --
241347,L452037,u7148,m480,INIGO,-- offer me everything I ask for --
241348,L452036,u7152,m480,RUGEN,-- all that I have and more please --
241349,L452035,u7148,m480,INIGO,-- power too -- promise me that --
241350,L452034,u7152,m480,RUGEN,-- yes --
241351,L452033,u7148,m480,INIGO,-- offer me money --
241352,L452032,u7152,m480,RUGEN,No --
241353,L452030,u7152,m480,RUGEN,Stop saying that!
241354,L452029,u7148,m480,INIGO,Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
241355,L451917,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
241356,L451916,u7148,m480,INIGO,Thank you for everything.
241357,L451910,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job."
241358,L451909,u7148,m480,INIGO,Humiliations galore!
241359,L451892,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said ""to blave."" And, as we all know, ""to blave"" means ""to bluff."" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated"
241360,L451891,u7148,m480,INIGO,True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
241361,L451887,u7148,m480,INIGO,What's that?
241362,L451886,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do."
241363,L451885,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth."
241364,L451884,u7148,m480,INIGO,He's dead. He can't talk.
241365,L451883,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him."
241366,L451882,u7148,m480,INIGO,"I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years."
241367,L451881,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,Are you a rotten liar.
241368,L451880,u7148,m480,INIGO,"This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation."
241369,L451879,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93."
241370,L451878,u7148,m480,INIGO,Sixty-five.
241371,L451877,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?"
241372,L451876,u7148,m480,INIGO,We're really in a terrible rush.
241373,L451875,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,Hah?
241374,L451874,u7148,m480,INIGO,Sir. Sir.
241375,L451872,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in."
241376,L451871,u7148,m480,INIGO,He's already dead.
241377,L451870,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle."
241378,L451865,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!"
241379,L451864,u7148,m480,INIGO,Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
241380,L451863,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,What? What?
241381,L451521,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --"
241382,L451520,u7148,m480,INIGO,Kill me quickly.
241383,L451518,u7148,m480,INIGO,Okay.
241384,L451517,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Get used to disappointment.
241385,L451516,u7148,m480,INIGO,I must know.
241386,L451515,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,No one of consequence.
241387,L451514,u7148,m480,INIGO,Who are you?!
241388,L451513,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,I am not left-handed either.
241389,L451512,u7148,m480,INIGO,Tell me.
241390,L451511,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,There's something I ought to tell you.
241391,L451510,u7148,m480,INIGO,I ought to be after twenty years.
241392,L451509,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You're amazing!
241393,L451507,u7148,m480,INIGO,I am not left-handed.
241394,L451506,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,And what is that?
241395,L451505,u7148,m480,INIGO,Because I know something you don't know.
241396,L451504,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Then why are you smiling?
241397,L451503,u7148,m480,INIGO,I admit it -- you are better than I am.
241398,L451502,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
241399,L451501,u7148,m480,INIGO,You are wonderful!
241400,L451497,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro."
241401,L451496,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --"
241402,L451494,u7148,m480,INIGO,Begin!
241403,L451493,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
241404,L451492,u7148,m480,INIGO,You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
241405,L451491,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30."
241406,L451490,u7148,m480,INIGO,"You are ready, then?"
241407,L451489,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday."
241408,L451488,u7148,m480,INIGO,"More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge."
241409,L451487,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You've done nothing but study swordplay?
241410,L451486,u7148,m480,INIGO,"I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."""
241411,L451485,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,How old were you?
241412,L451481,u7148,m480,INIGO,"My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done."
241413,L451480,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Do you always begin conversations this way?
241414,L451478,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Again. Thank you.
241415,L451477,u7148,m480,INIGO,We'll wait until you're ready.
241416,L451473,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Nothing comes to mind.
241417,L451472,u7148,m480,INIGO,You don't know any way you'll trust me?
241418,L451471,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
241419,L451470,u7148,m480,INIGO,I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
241420,L451469,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
241421,L451468,u7148,m480,INIGO,But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
241422,L451467,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,That does put a damper on our relationship.
241423,L451466,u7148,m480,INIGO,"I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you."
241424,L451465,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26."
241425,L451464,u7148,m480,INIGO,I do not suppose you could speed things up?
241426,L451463,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Thank you.
241427,L451462,u7148,m480,INIGO,Sorry.
241428,L451461,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me."
241429,L451460,u7148,m480,INIGO,Slow going?
241430,L451455,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Oh, have it your way."
241431,L451454,u7148,m480,INIGO,"Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly."
241432,L451453,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,You know what a hurry we're in.
241433,L451452,u7148,m480,INIGO,I want to duel him left-handed.
241434,L451450,u7148,m480,INIGO,You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
241435,L451449,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
241436,L451438,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,Inconceivable!
241437,L451437,u7148,m480,INIGO,He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
241438,L451435,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19."
241439,L451434,u7148,m480,INIGO,Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
241440,L451411,u7148,m480,INIGO,I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
241441,L451410,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Go in, get after her!"
241442,L451408,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,What?
241443,L451407,u7148,m480,INIGO,"No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there."
241444,L451406,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?"
241445,L451405,u7148,m480,INIGO,You're sure nobody's following us?
241446,L451404,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-"
241447,L451401,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,That would be inconceivable.
241448,L451400,u7148,m480,INIGO,Making sure nobody's following us.
241449,L451601,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
241450,L451600,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You guessed wrong.
241451,L451599,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours."
241452,L451598,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,What's so funny?
241453,L451593,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,I will. And I choose --
241454,L451592,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Then make your choice.
241455,L451591,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
241456,L451590,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
241457,L451589,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me."
241458,L451588,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You're just stalling now.
241459,L451587,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46."
241460,L451586,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Australia.
241461,L451585,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,Wait till I get going! Where was I?
241462,L451584,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Truly, you have a dizzying intellect."
241463,L451583,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you."
241464,L451582,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You've made your decision then7
241465,L451581,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me."
241466,L451578,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,Hmm.
241467,L451577,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man."
241468,L451576,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,I smell nothing.
241469,L451575,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Inhale this, but do not touch."
241470,L451574,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Good. Then pour the wine.
241471,L451573,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,I accept.
241472,L451571,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,For the Princess?
241473,L451570,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits."
241474,L451569,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,Morons.
241475,L451568,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Yes.
241476,L451567,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,"Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?"
241477,L451566,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,You're that smart?
241478,L451565,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
241479,L451564,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,"But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse."
241480,L451563,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
241481,L451562,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
241482,L451561,u7155,m480,VIZZINI,-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
241483,L451560,u7149,m480,MAN IN BLACK,Let me explain-
241484,L451922,u7154,m480,VALERIE,Bye.
241485,L451921,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,It would take a miracle. Bye!
241486,L451920,u7154,m480,VALERIE,Think it'll work?
241487,L451919,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,Have fun storming the castle.
241488,L451918,u7154,m480,VALERIE,"Bye-bye, boys."
241489,L451915,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,A good hour. Yeah.
241490,L451914,u7154,m480,VALERIE,"Yeah, an hour."
241491,L451913,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,An hour.
241492,L451912,u7154,m480,VALERIE,"The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?"
241493,L451905,u7154,m480,VALERIE,Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
241494,L451904,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,Nobody's hearing nothing!
241495,L451903,u7154,m480,VALERIE,A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
241496,L451902,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,I'm not listening.
241497,L451901,u7154,m480,VALERIE,"What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck"
241498,L451900,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
241499,L451899,u7154,m480,VALERIE,"He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered."
241500,L451898,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"Don't say another word, Valerie."
241501,L451897,u7154,m480,VALERIE,"""True love."" He said, ""true love,"" Max. My God --"
241502,L451896,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
241503,L451895,u7154,m480,VALERIE,"I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore."
241504,L451894,u7150,m480,MIRACLE MAX,"-- get back, witch --"
241505,L451319,u7151,m480,MOTHER,Maybe he won't.
241506,L451318,u7153,m480,THE KID,He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
241507,L451317,u7151,m480,MOTHER,"You are sick, that's why he's here."
241508,L451316,u7153,m480,THE KID,"Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?"
241509,L451315,u7151,m480,MOTHER,Your grandfather's here.
241510,L451314,u7153,m480,THE KID,What?
241511,L451313,u7151,m480,MOTHER,Guess what.
241512,L451312,u7153,m480,THE KID,A little bit.
241513,L451311,u7151,m480,MOTHER,You feeling any better?
241514,L452745,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
241515,L452744,u7162,m481,DE BRIS,What are you saying?
241516,L452743,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
241517,L452690,u7162,m481,DE BRIS,Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
241518,L452689,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Congratulations.
241519,L452688,u7162,m481,DE BRIS,Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
241520,L452687,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER."
241521,L452686,u7162,m481,DE BRIS,"Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!"
241522,L452685,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and..."
241523,L452684,u7162,m481,DE BRIS,"Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt."
241524,L452683,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?"
241525,L452682,u7162,m481,DE BRIS,"How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?"
241526,L452864,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"""Keep a shining in..."
241527,L452863,u7161,m481,BLOOM AND DRUNK,"""Honeymoon, honeymoon,"
241528,L452862,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"""Honeymoon,"
241529,L452861,u7161,m481,BLOOM AND DRUNK,"""He's gonna croon love's tune,"
241530,L452860,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"""To my honey I'll croon,"
241531,L452859,u7161,m481,BLOOM AND DRUNK,"""He wants to croon, he wants to croon,"
241532,L452858,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"""I want to croon,"
241533,L452857,u7161,m481,BLOOM AND DRUNK,"""Of the silvery mooooon,"
241534,L452856,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"""Of the silvery moon,"
241535,L452855,u7161,m481,BLOOM AND DRUNK,"""By the light, by the light,"
241536,L453114,u7160,m481,BLOOM,He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt?
241537,L453113,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Don't help me.
241538,L453046,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo."
241539,L453045,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat."
241540,L453044,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What is it?
241541,L453043,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Max, I..."
241542,L453015,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?"
241543,L453014,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Liebkind, no!"
241544,L453013,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!"
241545,L453008,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Shut up.
241546,L453007,u7160,m481,BLOOM,What???
241547,L453006,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
241548,L452964,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Double.  Double.  Double.
241549,L452963,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you."
241550,L452962,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,I never should have listened to you.
241551,L452957,u7160,m481,BLOOM,I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
241552,L452956,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
241553,L452894,u7160,m481,BLOOM,The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
241554,L452893,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks."
241555,L452892,u7160,m481,BLOOM,No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
241556,L452891,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true."
241557,L452890,u7160,m481,BLOOM,No way out.  No way out.
241558,L452889,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Maybe it's not true!
241559,L452838,u7160,m481,BLOOM,To failure!
241560,L452837,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,To failure!
241561,L452788,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin."
241562,L452787,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
241563,L452786,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,So much for Nutsy Fagin.
241564,L452670,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you."
241565,L452669,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?"
241566,L452628,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Only if we ask him.
241567,L452627,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Do you think he'll take the job?
241568,L452626,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
241569,L452625,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?"
241570,L452624,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris."
241571,L452623,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court."
241572,L452622,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!"
241573,L452621,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything."
241574,L452605,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work."
241575,L452604,u7160,m481,BLOOM,What is she gonna do here?
241576,L452603,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"They'll say, ""Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."""
241577,L452602,u7160,m481,BLOOM,How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
241578,L452594,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy."
241579,L452593,u7160,m481,BLOOM,What are you doing?
241580,L452588,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money."
241581,L452587,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
241582,L452586,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Leo, what if this play is a hit?"
241583,L452585,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
241584,L452584,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
241585,L452583,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
241586,L452534,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Okay, take it off, take it off."
241587,L452533,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is."
241588,L452532,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"There it is... in red and white! ""Springtime For Hitler,"" signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?"
241589,L452495,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag."
241590,L452494,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army."
241591,L452434,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Who wrote it?
241592,L452433,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
241593,L452432,u7160,m481,BLOOM,It won't run a week!
241594,L452426,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!"
241595,L452425,u7160,m481,BLOOM,You found a flop!
241596,L452424,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all."
241597,L452423,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?"
241598,L452422,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket."
241599,L452403,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!"
241600,L452402,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!"
241601,L452401,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us."
241602,L452399,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!"
241603,L452398,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
241604,L452388,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy."
241605,L452387,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Maybe you're happy.
241606,L452386,u7160,m481,BLOOM,I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
241607,L452385,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?"
241608,L452383,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Two pistachios, my good man."
241609,L452382,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green."
241610,L452381,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"What kind now, Leo?"
241611,L452377,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Then stick with Bialystock!
241612,L452376,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Right.
241613,L452375,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?"
241614,L452374,u7160,m481,BLOOM,I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
241615,L452373,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?"
241616,L452372,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Coney Island??
241617,L452371,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
241618,L452370,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?"
241619,L452369,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Where would you like to eat?
241620,L452368,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Oh.
241621,L452367,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,I already have.  Come on.
241622,L452366,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
241623,L452365,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like."
241624,L452364,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"I got it, Mr. Bialystock."
241625,L452347,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ..."
241626,L452346,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch."
241627,L452345,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know."
241628,L452344,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Well, you know what they say, ""Smile and the world smiles with you.""  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?"
241629,L452343,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
241630,L452342,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,How's this?
241631,L452341,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"It's a little better, but you still look angry."
241632,L452340,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
241633,L452339,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
241634,L452338,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
241635,L452332,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical."
241636,L452331,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
241637,L452330,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
241638,L452329,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Will you get a hold on yourself.
241639,L452328,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Aaaaaaaaaa!
241640,L452327,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,I'm not going to jump on you!
241641,L452326,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me."
241642,L452325,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What???
241643,L452324,u7160,m481,BLOOM,You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
241644,L452323,u7160,m481,BLOOM,You're going to jump on me.
241645,L452322,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?"
241646,L452321,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here."
241647,L452318,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life."
241648,L452317,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it."
241649,L452316,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
241650,L452311,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!"
241651,L452310,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought."
241652,L452309,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius."
241653,L452308,u7160,m481,BLOOM,What scheme?
241654,L452307,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop."
241655,L452306,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?"
241656,L452305,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,But what if the play was a hit?
241657,L452304,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest."
241658,L452303,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,One night.
241659,L452302,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Exactly.  And how long did it run?
241660,L452301,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"But the play only cost $60,000 to produce."
241661,L452300,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million."
241662,L452299,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
241663,L452298,u7160,m481,BLOOM,You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
241664,L452297,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What did I do?
241665,L452296,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale."
241666,L452295,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What do you mean?
241667,L452294,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need."
241668,L452293,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Assume away!
241669,L452290,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?"
241670,L452289,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Yes, it's quite possible."
241671,L452288,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit."
241672,L452287,u7160,m481,BLOOM,What was I saying?
241673,L452286,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What you were saying.  Keep talking.
241674,L452285,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Yes, what?"
241675,L452278,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ..."
241676,L452277,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
241677,L452276,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped."
241678,L452275,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
241679,L452274,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Oh, it's all right ... wha?"
241680,L452273,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you."
241681,L452272,u7160,m481,BLOOM,All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
241682,L452271,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Help!
241683,L452268,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!"
241684,L452267,u7160,m481,BLOOM,But that's cheating!
241685,L452266,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title."
241686,L452265,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison."
241687,L452264,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?"
241688,L452263,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for."
241689,L452262,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Where?  What?
241690,L452261,u7160,m481,BLOOM,This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
241691,L452260,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?"
241692,L452259,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Mr. Bialystock ...
241693,L452258,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
241694,L452257,u7160,m481,BLOOM,I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
241695,L452256,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Here, don't panic."
241696,L452251,u7160,m481,BLOOM,It's nothing ... nothing.
241697,L452250,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,What is that?  A handkerchief?
241698,L452246,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time."
241699,L452245,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"In looking at your books, I've discovered that ..."
241700,L452244,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
241701,L452243,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Well, sir, it seems ..."
241702,L452242,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
241703,L452241,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?"
241704,L452240,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Good, what is it?"
241705,L452239,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,I have hurt your feelings.
241706,L452238,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?"
241707,L452237,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ..."
241708,L452236,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it."
241709,L452233,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there."
241710,L452232,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"Yes, sir.  Thank you."
241711,L452231,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Do the books!  Do the books!
241712,L452230,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
241713,L452224,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
241714,L452223,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"But sir, I'm not condem ..."
241715,L452217,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?"
241716,L452216,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Yes sir.
241717,L452212,u7160,m481,BLOOM,"I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady."
241718,L452211,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are."
241719,L452210,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Scared.  Can't talk.
241720,L452209,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?"
241721,L452208,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
241722,L452156,u7160,m481,BLOOM,Ooooooops.
241723,L452155,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Oooooooops!
241724,L452154,u7160,m481,BLOOM,I'll wait in the hall ...
241725,L452153,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out."
241726,L452152,u7160,m481,BLOOM,How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
241727,L452151,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again."
241728,L453089,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
241729,L453088,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Do you need us?
241730,L453083,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,"I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child."
241731,L453082,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Do it!  Do it!
241732,L453072,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
241733,L453071,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
241734,L453068,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
241735,L453067,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
241736,L453066,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,"Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower."
241737,L453049,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
241738,L453048,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Come on.  Let's get going.
241739,L453047,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
241740,L453042,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You mean out of business.  Heh, heh."
241741,L453041,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,"Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business."
241742,L453005,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
241743,L453004,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
241744,L453003,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Always.
241745,L453002,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?"
241746,L453001,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
241747,L452998,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
241748,L452997,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
241749,L452990,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,"Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!"
241750,L452989,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,Not.
241751,L452768,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,"All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you."
241752,L452767,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down."
241753,L452764,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,I don't know.  I don't know.
241754,L452763,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory."
241755,L452762,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,But he has long hair!
241756,L452761,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,"Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time."
241757,L452760,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Vaaaat???
241758,L452735,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
241759,L452734,u7158,m481,BIALYSTOCK,You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
241760,L452493,u7165,m481,LIEBKIND,Good.  I will make the preparations.

241929,L454239,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
241930,L454238,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"You said she was sitting ""back there,"" or standing rather..."
241931,L454237,u7177,m482,NORMAN,What do you mean?
241932,L454236,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Back where?
241933,L454235,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way."
241934,L454234,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,How do you know she didn't make a call?
241935,L454233,u7177,m482,NORMAN,No! Of all...
241936,L454232,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
241937,L454231,u7177,m482,NORMAN,No.
241938,L454230,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
241939,L454229,u7177,m482,NORMAN,No.
241940,L454228,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Or arrived with her.
241941,L454227,u7177,m482,NORMAN,No.
241942,L454226,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,No one met her?
241943,L454225,u7177,m482,NORMAN,The following morning. Sunday.
241944,L454224,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Of which morning?
241945,L454223,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Very early. Dawn.
241946,L454222,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,How early?
241947,L454221,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early."
241948,L454220,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Tell me all about her.
241949,L454219,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess."
241950,L454218,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
241951,L454217,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"Don't know where she got ""Marie,"" but ""Samuels"" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?"
241952,L454214,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl..."
241953,L454213,u7177,m482,NORMAN,What?
241954,L454212,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?"
241955,L454210,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me..."
241956,L454209,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered..."
241957,L454208,u7177,m482,NORMAN,No. At least I don't recall.
241958,L454207,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Look at the picture. Please.
241959,L454206,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
241960,L454205,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
241961,L454204,u7177,m482,NORMAN,No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
241962,L454203,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
241963,L454202,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Oh.
241964,L454201,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,I'm not the police.
241965,L454200,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
241966,L454199,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble."
241967,L454198,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
241968,L454197,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,No.
241969,L454196,u7177,m482,NORMAN,You out to buy a motel?
241970,L454195,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell."
241971,L454194,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask..."
241972,L454193,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?"
241973,L454192,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large."
241974,L454191,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies."
241975,L454167,u7180,m482,SAM,I don't believe it.  Do you?
241976,L454166,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add."
241977,L454165,u7180,m482,SAM,Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
241978,L454154,u7180,m482,SAM,What are you talking about?  What is this?
241979,L454153,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Must've needed it.
241980,L454152,u7180,m482,SAM,Why?
241981,L454151,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
241982,L454150,u7180,m482,SAM,Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
241983,L454149,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Money.
241984,L454148,u7180,m482,SAM,What's your interest?
241985,L454145,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?"
241986,L454144,u7180,m482,SAM,"Who are you, friend?"
241987,L454143,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Let's all talk about Mary.
241988,L454164,u7173,m482,LILA,I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
241989,L454163,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"With a little checking, I could get to believe you."
241990,L454162,u7173,m482,LILA,Not even a hunch. Just hope.
241991,L454161,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?"
241992,L454159,u7173,m482,LILA,"Sam, if she's here..."
241993,L454158,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Casharoonie!
241994,L454157,u7173,m482,LILA,"Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash..."
241995,L454156,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,"Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?"
241996,L454147,u7169,m482,ARBOGAST,Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
241997,L454146,u7173,m482,LILA,I don't know.
241998,L453978,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,Okay. If you'll come along...
241999,L453977,u7175,m482,MARY,I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
242000,L453976,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all."
242001,L453975,u7175,m482,MARY,But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
242002,L453974,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but..."
242003,L453973,u7175,m482,MARY,I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
242004,L453972,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
242005,L453971,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman."
242006,L453970,u7175,m482,MARY,I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
242007,L453969,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your..."
242008,L453968,u7175,m482,MARY,All right.
242009,L453967,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?"
242010,L453966,u7175,m482,MARY,Five hundred.
242011,L453965,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred."
242012,L453964,u7175,m482,MARY,Of course not. Please.
242013,L453963,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
242014,L453962,u7175,m482,MARY,"It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?"
242015,L453961,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block..."
242016,L453960,u7175,m482,MARY,How much?
242017,L453959,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
242018,L453957,u7175,m482,MARY,No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
242019,L453956,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about..."
242020,L453955,u7175,m482,MARY,"Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just..."
242021,L453954,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?"
242022,L453953,u7175,m482,MARY,Can I trade in my car and take another?
242023,L453952,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,"There's an old saying, ""First customer of the day is always the most trouble!"" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me..."
242024,L453951,u7175,m482,MARY,What?
242025,L453950,u7170,m482,CAR DEALER,I'm in no mood for trouble!
242026,L453924,u7175,m482,MARY,I don't need pills... just sleep.
242027,L453923,u7171,m482,CAROLINE,Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
242028,L453897,u7171,m482,CAROLINE,"Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and..."
242029,L453896,u7175,m482,MARY,Were there any calls?
242030,L453895,u7171,m482,CAROLINE,"You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!"
242031,L453894,u7175,m482,MARY,It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
242032,L453893,u7171,m482,CAROLINE,"He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?"
242033,L453892,u7175,m482,MARY,Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
242034,L453992,u7172,m482,CAROLINE'S VOICE,Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
242035,L453991,u7174,m482,LOWERY'S VOICE,You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
242036,L453990,u7172,m482,CAROLINE'S VOICE,"I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do."
242037,L453989,u7174,m482,LOWERY'S VOICE,Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
242038,L453988,u7174,m482,LOWERY'S VOICE,Buzz me the minute she comes in.
242039,L453987,u7172,m482,CAROLINE'S VOICE,"No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings."
242040,L453986,u7174,m482,LOWERY'S VOICE,Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
242041,L453985,u7172,m482,CAROLINE'S VOICE,"Yes, Mr. Lowery."
242042,L454413,u7173,m482,LILA,I don't know.
242043,L454412,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?"
242044,L454411,u7173,m482,LILA,I still feel...
242045,L454408,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Just what he told your detective.
242046,L454407,u7173,m482,LILA,Did he say anything about my sister?
242047,L454383,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
242048,L454382,u7173,m482,LILA,Yes.
242049,L454379,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
242050,L454378,u7173,m482,LILA,What difference does that...
242051,L454377,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know..."
242052,L454373,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards."
242053,L454372,u7173,m482,LILA,Please!
242054,L454359,u7173,m482,LILA,He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
242055,L454358,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money."
242056,L454357,u7173,m482,LILA,"Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!"
242057,L454356,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Like what?
242058,L454355,u7173,m482,LILA,"He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!"
242059,L454354,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,With the forty thousand dollars?
242060,L454353,u7173,m482,LILA,"Mary had been there, one night, and had left."
242061,L454350,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,And the police haven't been able to...
242062,L454349,u7173,m482,LILA,Forty thousand dollars.
242063,L454348,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,A lot?
242064,L454347,u7173,m482,LILA,She stole some money.
242065,L454344,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
242066,L454343,u7173,m482,LILA,Yes.
242067,L454340,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
242068,L454339,u7173,m482,LILA,She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
242069,L454338,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Now. Your sister is missing how long?
242070,L454337,u7173,m482,LILA,Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
242071,L454522,u7173,m482,LILA,I could stand something regular.
242072,L454521,u7180,m482,SAM,It's regular. Okay?
242073,L454483,u7180,m482,SAM,Bates.
242074,L454482,u7173,m482,LILA,Why not?
242075,L454481,u7180,m482,SAM,You can't go up there.
242076,L454480,u7173,m482,LILA,"Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!"
242077,L454479,u7180,m482,SAM,Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
242078,L454478,u7173,m482,LILA,Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
242079,L454477,u7180,m482,SAM,Bates never denied Mary was here.
242080,L454476,u7173,m482,LILA,That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
242081,L454475,u7173,m482,LILA,It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
242082,L454474,u7180,m482,SAM,What is it?
242083,L454473,u7173,m482,LILA,The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
242084,L454472,u7180,m482,SAM,What?
242085,L454471,u7173,m482,LILA,Hospital clean.
242086,L454470,u7180,m482,SAM,Sorry.
242087,L454466,u7173,m482,LILA,"Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!"
242088,L454465,u7180,m482,SAM,What makes you sound so certain?
242089,L454464,u7173,m482,LILA,There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
242090,L454463,u7180,m482,SAM,"How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now..."
242091,L454462,u7173,m482,LILA,"Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?"
242092,L454461,u7180,m482,SAM,"I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?"
242093,L454460,u7173,m482,LILA,"We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt."
242094,L454459,u7180,m482,SAM,I'm glad we didn't.
242095,L454458,u7173,m482,LILA,We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
242096,L454441,u7173,m482,LILA,Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
242097,L454440,u7180,m482,SAM,I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
242098,L454439,u7173,m482,LILA,I believe it.
242099,L454438,u7180,m482,SAM,You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
242100,L454437,u7173,m482,LILA,"We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside."
242101,L454436,u7180,m482,SAM,I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
242102,L454435,u7173,m482,LILA,You going to wait here for me?
242103,L454434,u7180,m482,SAM,She always tries to be proper.
242104,L454433,u7173,m482,LILA,Huh?
242105,L454432,u7180,m482,SAM,Watch your tenses.
242106,L454431,u7173,m482,LILA,"I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper."
242107,L454430,u7180,m482,SAM,This is the old highway.
242108,L454429,u7173,m482,LILA,"Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam."
242109,L454428,u7180,m482,SAM,We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
242110,L454427,u7173,m482,LILA,"I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers."
242111,L454426,u7180,m482,SAM,She was willing to lick the stamps.
242112,L454425,u7173,m482,LILA,"I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them."
242113,L454424,u7180,m482,SAM,Where'd you go to college?
242114,L454422,u7173,m482,LILA,Alive.
242115,L454421,u7180,m482,SAM,Of course we will.
242116,L454420,u7173,m482,LILA,I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
242117,L454419,u7180,m482,SAM,Neither will I.
242118,L454418,u7173,m482,LILA,"I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam."
242119,L454416,u7173,m482,LILA,You're not.
242120,L454415,u7180,m482,SAM,Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
242121,L454367,u7173,m482,LILA,"All right! Then call! At least, call!"
242122,L454366,u7180,m482,SAM,"I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but..."
242123,L454330,u7180,m482,SAM,"This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary..."
242124,L454329,u7173,m482,LILA,Yes.
242125,L454328,u7180,m482,SAM,I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
242126,L454327,u7173,m482,LILA,"No, thank you. It's my problem, too."
242127,L454319,u7180,m482,SAM,No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
242128,L454318,u7173,m482,LILA,Does that mean we can't...
242129,L454317,u7180,m482,SAM,Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
242130,L454316,u7173,m482,LILA,Well?
242131,L454315,u7180,m482,SAM,Our Deputy sleeps.
242132,L454314,u7180,m482,SAM,He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
242133,L454313,u7173,m482,LILA,Who's he?
242134,L454312,u7180,m482,SAM,Let's go see Al Chambers.
242135,L454311,u7180,m482,SAM,Yes. I think he would have.
242136,L454310,u7173,m482,LILA,"Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything..."
242137,L454309,u7180,m482,SAM,In a hurry.
242138,L454308,u7173,m482,LILA,Without calling me?
242139,L454307,u7180,m482,SAM,Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
242140,L454306,u7173,m482,LILA,Where could he have gone?
242141,L454305,u7180,m482,SAM,No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
242142,L454304,u7173,m482,LILA,Sam.
242143,L454303,u7180,m482,SAM,He didn't come back here?
242144,L454301,u7180,m482,SAM,Contemplate your... panic button.
242145,L454300,u7173,m482,LILA,Just wait here?
242146,L454299,u7180,m482,SAM,I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
242147,L454298,u7173,m482,LILA,Why can't I go out there with you?
242148,L454297,u7180,m482,SAM,Stay here.
242149,L454296,u7180,m482,SAM,You'll never find it.
242150,L454295,u7173,m482,LILA,"Sam, I'm going."
242151,L454294,u7180,m482,SAM,Probably on his way back right now.
242152,L454293,u7180,m482,SAM,And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
242153,L454292,u7173,m482,LILA,Sam! Why call when we can go?
242154,L454291,u7180,m482,SAM,"Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think."
242155,L454290,u7173,m482,LILA,An hour! Or less!
242156,L454289,u7180,m482,SAM,Arbogast said...
242157,L454288,u7173,m482,LILA,"Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!"
242158,L454287,u7180,m482,SAM,That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
242159,L454286,u7173,m482,LILA,Yes.
242160,L454285,u7180,m482,SAM,"You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours."
242161,L454284,u7173,m482,LILA,Where's the old highway?
242162,L454283,u7180,m482,SAM,I feel better when you feel better.
242163,L454282,u7173,m482,LILA,"Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better."
242164,L454281,u7180,m482,SAM,Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
242165,L454280,u7173,m482,LILA,"You have an awfully nice habit, Sam."
242166,L454279,u7180,m482,SAM,"He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?"
242167,L454278,u7173,m482,LILA,Are we just going to go on sitting here?
242168,L454277,u7180,m482,SAM,It's been three.
242169,L454276,u7173,m482,LILA,Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
242170,L454275,u7180,m482,SAM,"Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?"
242171,L454190,u7180,m482,SAM,"First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait."
242172,L454189,u7173,m482,LILA,Where... can I stay?
242173,L454188,u7180,m482,SAM,She'll need both of us.
242174,L454187,u7173,m482,LILA,You want me to stay here?
242175,L454186,u7180,m482,SAM,I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
242176,L454185,u7173,m482,LILA,"I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home."
242177,L454184,u7180,m482,SAM,Maybe we can handle it together.
242178,L454183,u7173,m482,LILA,"No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle..."
242179,L454182,u7180,m482,SAM,You've led a charmed life.
242180,L454181,u7173,m482,LILA,I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
242181,L454180,u7180,m482,SAM,I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
242182,L454179,u7173,m482,LILA,She haven't even called you?
242183,L454178,u7180,m482,SAM,How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
242184,L454177,u7173,m482,LILA,"Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?"
242185,L454176,u7180,m482,SAM,No.
242186,L454175,u7173,m482,LILA,I ought to call the police right now!
242187,L454174,u7180,m482,SAM,He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
242188,L454173,u7173,m482,LILA,"No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police."
242189,L454172,u7180,m482,SAM,It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
242190,L454171,u7173,m482,LILA,I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
242191,L454169,u7180,m482,SAM,"You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister."
242192,L454168,u7173,m482,LILA,Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
242193,L454142,u7180,m482,SAM,Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
242194,L454141,u7173,m482,LILA,Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
242195,L454140,u7180,m482,SAM,Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
242196,L454139,u7173,m482,LILA,Yes.
242197,L454138,u7180,m482,SAM,Is Mary... in trouble?
242198,L454137,u7173,m482,LILA,I hate tears.
242199,L454136,u7180,m482,SAM,What thing could we be in together?
242200,L454135,u7173,m482,LILA,Huh?
242201,L454134,u7180,m482,SAM,What thing?
242202,L454130,u7173,m482,LILA,"Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and..."
242203,L454129,u7180,m482,SAM,Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
242204,L454128,u7173,m482,LILA,What do you know about it?
242205,L454127,u7180,m482,SAM,I was getting to that!
242206,L454126,u7173,m482,LILA,"Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing."
242207,L454125,u7180,m482,SAM,"Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and..."
242208,L454124,u7173,m482,LILA,"A good reason, I suppose."
242209,L454123,u7180,m482,SAM,"And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?"
242210,L454122,u7173,m482,LILA,"Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call."
242211,L454121,u7180,m482,SAM,No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
242212,L454120,u7173,m482,LILA,"To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?"
242213,L454119,u7180,m482,SAM,What should I know?
242214,L454117,u7173,m482,LILA,Don't you know?
242215,L454116,u7180,m482,SAM,What's the matter?
242216,L454115,u7173,m482,LILA,"I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere."
242217,L454114,u7180,m482,SAM,Where?
242218,L454113,u7173,m482,LILA,With you.
242219,L454112,u7180,m482,SAM,Here?
242220,L454111,u7173,m482,LILA,I want to know if my sister is here.
242221,L454110,u7180,m482,SAM,Is something wrong?
242222,L454109,u7173,m482,LILA,Is Mary here?
242223,L454108,u7180,m482,SAM,Lila.
242224,L454107,u7173,m482,LILA,I'm Mary's sister.
242225,L454106,u7180,m482,SAM,Sure...
242226,L454105,u7173,m482,LILA,May I talk to you?
242227,L454104,u7180,m482,SAM,Yes?
242228,L453891,u7175,m482,MARY,I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
242229,L453890,u7180,m482,SAM,"Hey, we can leave together can't we?"
242230,L453889,u7175,m482,MARY,Don't miss your plane.
242231,L453888,u7180,m482,SAM,How can you even think a thing like that!
242232,L453887,u7175,m482,MARY,I'm thinking of it.
242233,L453886,u7180,m482,SAM,"You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available."
242234,L453885,u7175,m482,MARY,I'll lick the stamps.
242235,L453884,u7180,m482,SAM,"And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps."
242236,L453883,u7175,m482,MARY,"Sam, let's go get married."
242237,L453882,u7180,m482,SAM,"Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing."
242238,L453881,u7175,m482,MARY,I haven't even been married once yet!
242239,L453880,u7180,m482,SAM,"A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then..."
242240,L453879,u7175,m482,MARY,"I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms."
242241,L453878,u7180,m482,SAM,"I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere."
242242,L453877,u7180,m482,SAM,"I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind."
242243,L453876,u7175,m482,MARY,You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
242244,L453875,u7180,m482,SAM,"Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability."
242245,L453874,u7180,m482,SAM,All right.
242246,L453873,u7175,m482,MARY,Sam! No!
242247,L453872,u7180,m482,SAM,And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
242248,L453871,u7175,m482,MARY,"We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!"
242249,L453870,u7180,m482,SAM,"Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?"
242250,L453869,u7175,m482,MARY,No.
242251,L453868,u7180,m482,SAM,I can come down next week.
242252,L453867,u7175,m482,MARY,"I have to go, Sam."
242253,L453866,u7180,m482,SAM,I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
242254,L453865,u7175,m482,MARY,You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
242255,L453864,u7180,m482,SAM,"And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal."
242256,L453863,u7180,m482,SAM,"Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but..."
242257,L453862,u7175,m482,MARY,Can you?
242258,L453861,u7180,m482,SAM,"You can't laugh at it, huh?"
242259,L453860,u7175,m482,MARY,It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
242260,L453859,u7180,m482,SAM,And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!
242261,L453858,u7175,m482,MARY,I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
242262,L453857,u7180,m482,SAM,"Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?"
242263,L453856,u7175,m482,MARY,This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
242264,L453855,u7180,m482,SAM,For what?
242265,L453854,u7175,m482,MARY,Sam. This is the last time.
242266,L453853,u7180,m482,SAM,The only girlish thing you have lost.
242267,L453852,u7175,m482,MARY,I've lost my girlish laughter.
242268,L453851,u7180,m482,SAM,"I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it."
242269,L453850,u7175,m482,MARY,Sam!
242270,L453849,u7180,m482,SAM,You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
242271,L453848,u7175,m482,MARY,When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
242272,L453847,u7180,m482,SAM,I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
242273,L453846,u7175,m482,MARY,"Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this."
242274,L453845,u7180,m482,SAM,We could laze around here a while longer.
242275,L453844,u7175,m482,MARY,"What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?"
242276,L453843,u7180,m482,SAM,Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
242277,L454097,u7175,m482,MARY,Good night.
242278,L454096,u7177,m482,NORMAN,That's it.
242279,L454095,u7175,m482,MARY,Crane.
242280,L454094,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Alright, Miss..."
242281,L454093,u7175,m482,MARY,Very early. Dawn.
242282,L454092,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
242283,L454091,u7175,m482,MARY,"I'd like to, but..."
242284,L454090,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking."
242285,L454089,u7175,m482,MARY,"I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too."
242286,L454088,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Phoenix?
242287,L454087,u7175,m482,MARY,I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
242288,L454086,u7177,m482,NORMAN,You're not going to... to your room already?
242289,L454085,u7175,m482,MARY,Norman.
242290,L454084,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Thank you, Norman."
242291,L454083,u7175,m482,MARY,"Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you."
242292,L454082,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?"
242293,L454081,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that..."
242294,L454080,u7175,m482,MARY,I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
242295,L454079,u7177,m482,NORMAN,What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
242296,L454078,u7175,m482,MARY,I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
242297,L454077,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse ""someplace.""  Put her in Someplace!"
242298,L454076,u7175,m482,MARY,Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
242299,L454075,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness."
242300,L454074,u7175,m482,MARY,"No, not like me."
242301,L454073,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"To a private island, like you?"
242302,L454072,u7175,m482,MARY,Why don't you go away?
242303,L454071,u7177,m482,NORMAN,A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
242304,L454070,u7175,m482,MARY,Except you.
242305,L454069,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left."
242306,L454068,u7175,m482,MARY,She sounded strong...
242307,L454067,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill."
242308,L454066,u7175,m482,MARY,"If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again."
242309,L454065,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Oh I do... but I say I don't.
242310,L454064,u7175,m482,MARY,You should... mind it.
242311,L454063,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
242312,L454062,u7175,m482,MARY,Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
242313,L454061,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch."
242314,L454060,u7175,m482,MARY,Why do you ask that?
242315,L454059,u7177,m482,NORMAN,What are you running away from?
242316,L454058,u7175,m482,MARY,I'm looking for a private island.
242317,L454057,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
242318,L454056,u7175,m482,MARY,Only my share.
242319,L454055,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
242320,L454054,u7175,m482,MARY,You go out... with friends?
242321,L454053,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing."
242322,L454052,u7175,m482,MARY,Is your time so empty?
242323,L454051,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it."
242324,L454050,u7175,m482,MARY,A man should have a hobby.
242325,L454049,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything."
242326,L454048,u7175,m482,MARY,I imagine so.
242327,L454047,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Uncommon, too."
242328,L454046,u7175,m482,MARY,"It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean."
242329,L454045,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats ""like a bird,"" is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them..."
242330,L454044,u7175,m482,MARY,"You'd know, of course."
242331,L454043,u7177,m482,NORMAN,You eat like a bird.
242332,L454042,u7177,m482,NORMAN,It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
242333,L454041,u7175,m482,MARY,You're very... kind.
242334,L454037,u7175,m482,MARY,"Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?"
242335,L454036,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
242336,L454035,u7175,m482,MARY,You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
242337,L454034,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Mother...  ...what is the phrase... ""she isn't herself today""... I think that's it."
242338,L454033,u7175,m482,MARY,I've caused you some trouble.
242339,L454024,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella."
242340,L454023,u7175,m482,MARY,I'd like to.
242341,L454022,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey."
242342,L454021,u7175,m482,MARY,No.
242343,L454020,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?"
242344,L454019,u7175,m482,MARY,Thank you. Again.
242345,L454018,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease."
242346,L454017,u7175,m482,MARY,I have?
242347,L454016,u7177,m482,NORMAN,You have something most girls never have.
242348,L454015,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Norman Bates.
242349,L454014,u7175,m482,MARY,"Thank you, Mr. Bates."
242350,L454013,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
242351,L454012,u7175,m482,MARY,The bathroom.
242352,L454011,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with ""Bates' Motel"" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there...."
242353,L454010,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
242354,L454009,u7175,m482,MARY,Am I that close to Fairvale?
242355,L454008,u7177,m482,NORMAN,There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
242356,L454007,u7175,m482,MARY,"I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food."
242357,L454005,u7175,m482,MARY,Los Angeles.
242358,L454004,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"Your home address. Oh, just the town will do."
242359,L454002,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
242360,L454001,u7175,m482,MARY,I thought I'd gotten off the main...
242361,L454000,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway."
242362,L453999,u7175,m482,MARY,You have a vacancy?
242363,L453998,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Dirty night.
242364,L453948,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,Please.
242365,L453947,u7175,m482,MARY,Why?
242366,L453946,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,May I see your license?
242367,L453945,u7175,m482,MARY,Now what?
242368,L453944,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,Wait a minute!
242369,L453943,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,No need to apologize...
242370,L453942,u7175,m482,MARY,I'm sorry.
242371,L453941,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,"In the course of my duty, I never ""take up"" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest..."
242372,L453940,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,"Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please."
242373,L453939,u7175,m482,MARY,Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
242374,L453938,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,Is there?
242375,L453937,u7175,m482,MARY,Please... I'd like to go...
242376,L453936,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,"Frankly, yes."
242377,L453935,u7175,m482,MARY,Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
242378,L453934,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,Is anything wrong?
242379,L453933,u7175,m482,MARY,Then I'm free to go...?
242380,L453932,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,"No, m'am."
242381,L453931,u7175,m482,MARY,I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
242382,L453930,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,"There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe..."
242383,L453929,u7175,m482,MARY,"Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes..."
242384,L453928,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,You slept here all night?
242385,L453927,u7175,m482,MARY,"Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over..."
242386,L453926,u7179,m482,PATROLMAN,In quite a hurry.
242387,L454402,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,He's already been.
242388,L454401,u7180,m482,SAM,"We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you."
242389,L454389,u7180,m482,SAM,I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
242390,L454388,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Maybe you saw Mary!
242391,L454387,u7180,m482,SAM,You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
242392,L454336,u7180,m482,SAM,"No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and..."
242393,L454335,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Norman took a wife?
242394,L454334,u7180,m482,SAM,He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
242395,L454333,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,"Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam."
242396,L454332,u7180,m482,SAM,"Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway..."
242397,L454331,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Mary is Lila's sister?
242398,L454326,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
242399,L454325,u7180,m482,SAM,We have a problem.
242400,L454322,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,"You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!"
242401,L454321,u7180,m482,SAM,"Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you..."
242402,L454320,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Oh?
242403,L454404,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Have you two had breakfast?
242404,L454403,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Went out before service.
242405,L454386,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
242406,L454385,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die."
242407,L454384,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
242408,L454381,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?"
242409,L454380,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Barefaced.
242410,L454371,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but..."
242411,L454370,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Arbogast.
242412,L454369,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of..."
242413,L454365,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
242414,L454364,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,Recluse. Kinder word.
242415,L454361,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,At this hour?
242416,L454360,u7176,m482,MRS. CHAMBERS,"Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert."
242417,L454513,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Leave me alone!
242418,L454512,u7180,m482,SAM,...Forty thousand dollars!
242419,L454511,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Leave me alone!
242420,L454510,u7180,m482,SAM,"Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it..."
242421,L454509,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Shut up!
242422,L454508,u7180,m482,SAM,Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
242423,L454507,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Do what?
242424,L454506,u7180,m482,SAM,I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
242425,L454505,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I don't know what you've been saying.
242426,L454504,u7180,m482,SAM,You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
242427,L454503,u7180,m482,SAM,I didn't think so.
242428,L454502,u7177,m482,NORMAN,My mother is not dead!
242429,L454501,u7180,m482,SAM,And now that your mother's dead?
242430,L454500,u7177,m482,NORMAN,This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
242431,L454499,u7180,m482,SAM,"I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place..."
242432,L454497,u7180,m482,SAM,Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
242433,L454496,u7177,m482,NORMAN,"That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?"
242434,L454495,u7180,m482,SAM,"I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy."
242435,L454494,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Yes.
242436,L454493,u7180,m482,SAM,"I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?"
242437,L454492,u7180,m482,SAM,Fine.
242438,L454491,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Satisfied with your cabin?
242439,L454490,u7180,m482,SAM,"Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk."
242440,L454489,u7177,m482,NORMAN,Looking for me?
242441,L454452,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I'll show you the cabin.
242442,L454451,u7180,m482,SAM,Haven't any.
242443,L454450,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I'll get your bags.
242444,L454449,u7180,m482,SAM,"Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt."
242445,L454448,u7177,m482,NORMAN,It isn't necessary.
242446,L454447,u7180,m482,SAM,"Better sign in first, hasn't we?"
242447,L454446,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I'll take you to...
242448,L454445,u7180,m482,SAM,"We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it."
242449,L454444,u7177,m482,NORMAN,I suppose you want a cabin.
242450,L454443,u7180,m482,SAM,Just coming up to ring for you.
242451,L454032,u7178,m482,NORMAN'S VOICE,Shut up! Shut up!
242452,L454031,u7182,m482,WOMAN'S VOICE,"Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?"
242453,L454030,u7182,m482,WOMAN'S VOICE,"Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?"
242454,L454029,u7178,m482,NORMAN'S VOICE,"Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad..."
242455,L454028,u7182,m482,WOMAN'S VOICE,"And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?"
242456,L454027,u7178,m482,NORMAN'S VOICE,"Mother, please..."
242457,L454026,u7182,m482,WOMAN'S VOICE,"I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!"
242458,L454410,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!"
242459,L454409,u7180,m482,SAM,No mother.
242460,L454406,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"Nothing. Here, let's clear the path."
242461,L454405,u7180,m482,SAM,You didn't find anything.
242462,L454392,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
242463,L454391,u7180,m482,SAM,Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
242464,L454390,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,"Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?"
242465,L454375,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
242466,L454374,u7180,m482,SAM,Was that all?
242467,L454363,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
242468,L454362,u7180,m482,SAM,He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
242469,L454352,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
242470,L454351,u7180,m482,SAM,Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
242471,L454346,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,From what?
242472,L454345,u7180,m482,SAM,Yes.
242473,L454342,u7181,m482,SHERIFF,Left Phoenix under her own steam?
242474,L454341,u7180,m482,SAM,They thought she'd be coming to me.
242475,L456022,u7184,m483,2ND EMBALMER,What--special autopsy?
242476,L456021,u7183,m483,1ST EMBALMER,That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
242477,L456020,u7184,m483,2ND EMBALMER,Did I?
242478,L456019,u7183,m483,1ST EMBALMER,You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
242479,L456018,u7184,m483,2ND EMBALMER,"Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population."
242480,L456017,u7183,m483,1ST EMBALMER,"By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime."
242481,L456118,u7190,m483,JONES,[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
242482,L456117,u7185,m483,2ND OFFICER,Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
242483,L456116,u7190,m483,JONES,Did she talk?
242484,L456115,u7185,m483,2ND OFFICER,Just before she died she came to--
242485,L456114,u7190,m483,JONES,Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
242486,L456113,u7185,m483,2ND OFFICER,Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
242487,L456267,u7186,m483,ALICE,"How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?"
242488,L456266,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help."
242489,L456265,u7186,m483,ALICE,What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
242490,L456264,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger."
242491,L456263,u7186,m483,ALICE,"Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating."
242492,L456262,u7186,m483,ALICE,"I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating."
242493,L456261,u7186,m483,ALICE,"No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--"
242494,L456260,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise."
242495,L456259,u7186,m483,ALICE,Then you knew of the inheritance?
242496,L456258,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose."
242497,L456257,u7186,m483,ALICE,So--friendly or otherwise--?
242498,L456256,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
242499,L456255,u7186,m483,ALICE,"Gosh, you had me fooled."
242500,L456228,u7186,m483,ALICE,Okay--I'll be here at eight.
242501,L456227,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
242502,L456226,u7186,m483,ALICE,Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
242503,L456225,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
242504,L456224,u7186,m483,ALICE,He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
242505,L456223,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
242506,L456222,u7186,m483,ALICE,He's inherited a fortune.
242507,L456221,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Indeed, he has often told me."
242508,L456220,u7186,m483,ALICE,It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
242509,L456219,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important."
242510,L456218,u7186,m483,ALICE,You mean he doesn't work for you?
242511,L456216,u7186,m483,ALICE,I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
242512,L456215,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,Did you wish to see someone?
242513,L456125,u7190,m483,JONES,Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
242514,L456124,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,"Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh"
242515,L456123,u7190,m483,JONES,"Dr. Meirschultz, too?"
242516,L456122,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
242517,L456121,u7190,m483,JONES,"Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz."
242518,L456112,u7190,m483,JONES,Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
242519,L456111,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,"No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--"
242520,L456106,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,I don't know--I can't tell--
242521,L456105,u7190,m483,JONES,"Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?"
242522,L456104,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,You--a friend to me?
242523,L456103,u7190,m483,JONES,"No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money."
242524,L456102,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,"Maybe you want my money, too."
242525,L456101,u7190,m483,JONES,Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
242526,L456100,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
242527,L456099,u7190,m483,JONES,What made you steal? Are you hungry?
242528,L456097,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,"I don't know, [I tell you]."
242529,L456096,u7190,m483,JONES,Who are you? What is your name?
242530,L456095,u7187,m483,BUCKLEY,No-
242531,L456132,u7188,m483,COLLINS,Why didn't you notify the police?
242532,L456131,u7193,m483,WOMAN,"I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night."
242533,L456130,u7188,m483,COLLINS,Maybe you're right.
242534,L456129,u7193,m483,WOMAN,"It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later."
242535,L456128,u7188,m483,COLLINS,That sounds to me very remarkable.
242536,L456127,u7193,m483,WOMAN,"Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once."
242537,L456149,u7190,m483,JONES,By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
242538,L456148,u7189,m483,GOOF,"Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]"
242539,L456146,u7189,m483,GOOF,"You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?"
242540,L456145,u7190,m483,JONES,But where do the rats come in?
242541,L456144,u7189,m483,GOOF,That's it. You get it quick.
242542,L456143,u7190,m483,JONES,"Oh, I see. Cats' fur."
242543,L456142,u7189,m483,GOOF,"Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business."
242544,L456141,u7190,m483,JONES,What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
242545,L456140,u7189,m483,GOOF,"Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats."
242546,L456139,u7190,m483,JONES,Thousands?
242547,L456138,u7189,m483,GOOF,"Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard."
242548,L456137,u7190,m483,JONES,[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
242549,L456136,u7189,m483,GOOF,He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
242550,L456135,u7190,m483,JONES,I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
242551,L456279,u7190,m483,JONES,"Come on, we're wasting time."
242552,L456278,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--"
242553,L456277,u7190,m483,JONES,"Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?"
242554,L456276,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
242555,L456275,u7190,m483,JONES,Take me down there.
242556,L456274,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument."
242557,L456273,u7190,m483,JONES,What's that?
242558,L456272,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him."
242559,L456271,u7190,m483,JONES,Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
242560,L456270,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,You here again?
242561,L456242,u7190,m483,JONES,I'd like to have a look.
242562,L456241,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion."
242563,L456240,u7190,m483,JONES,What's down there?
242564,L456239,u7190,m483,JONES,"Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru."
242565,L456238,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
242566,L456237,u7190,m483,JONES,"Do you have many patients, doctor?"
242567,L456236,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
242568,L456235,u7190,m483,JONES,"Oh, yes, he's in good hands now."
242569,L456234,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
242570,L456233,u7190,m483,JONES,So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
242571,L456232,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him."
242572,L456231,u7190,m483,JONES,"Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?"
242573,L456230,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Well, news of Buckley?"
242574,L456229,u7190,m483,JONES,How do you do.
242575,L456157,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Oh, Maxwell? He's left."
242576,L456156,u7190,m483,JONES,"By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?"
242577,L456153,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,You found Buckley?
242578,L456152,u7190,m483,JONES,I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
242579,L456253,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed."
242580,L456252,u7192,m483,MRS. BUCKLEY,"It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--."
242581,L456251,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]"
242582,L456250,u7192,m483,MRS. BUCKLEY,How? What can I do?
242583,L456249,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me."
242584,L456213,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!"
242585,L456212,u7192,m483,MRS. BUCKLEY,You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
242586,L456080,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,"No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--"
242587,L456079,u7192,m483,MRS. BUCKLEY,I'm going to call the police.
242588,L456078,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,What are you going to do?
242589,L456032,u7191,m483,MAXWELL,He isn't here.
242590,L456031,u7192,m483,MRS. BUCKLEY,"Dr. Meirschultz, please."
242591,L457450,u7194,m484,DOCTOR,Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
242592,L457449,u7197,m484,NIKOLAS,Yes!

242594,L457447,u7197,m484,NIKOLAS,I'm losing my blood!
242595,L457446,u7194,m484,DOCTOR,What is it now?
242596,L457443,u7194,m484,DOCTOR,Go to sleep!
242597,L457442,u7197,m484,NIKOLAS,The wound is bleeding!
242598,L457441,u7194,m484,DOCTOR,What is it?
242599,L457396,u7198,m484,NURSE,The master ... is asleep!
242600,L457395,u7195,m484,LONE,Yes!
242601,L457394,u7198,m484,NURSE,Your father?
242602,L457376,u7198,m484,NURSE,What did it say?
242603,L457375,u7195,m484,LONE,That called ... commanded ...
242604,L457374,u7198,m484,NURSE,That spoke to you?
242605,L457373,u7195,m484,LONE,A voice ...
242606,L457372,u7198,m484,NURSE,What were you dreaming about?
242607,L457332,u7196,m484,MARC,No!  Good night!
242608,L457331,u7197,m484,NIKOLAS,No?
242609,L457330,u7196,m484,MARC,"There's no child here, and no dogs either."
242610,L457329,u7197,m484,NIKOLAS,But ... the dogs...
242611,L457328,u7196,m484,MARC,There's no child here.
242612,L457327,u7197,m484,NIKOLAS,Yes.
242613,L457326,u7196,m484,MARC,The child!
242614,L457325,u7197,m484,NIKOLAS,"Yes, the child ..."
242615,L457324,u7196,m484,MARC,Did you hear?
242616,L457434,u7200,m484,THE SICK-ROOM,"The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Lone."
242617,L457433,u7199,m484,THE DRAWING-ROOM,Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
242618,L457432,u7200,m484,THE SICK-ROOM,"The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again."
242619,L457431,u7199,m484,THE DRAWING-ROOM,"Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown."
242620,L457430,u7200,m484,THE SICK-ROOM,The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
242621,L457429,u7199,m484,THE DRAWING-ROOM,Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
242622,L457428,u7200,m484,THE SICK-ROOM,"By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed."
242623,L458287,u7212,m485,SPARROW,"It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!"
242624,L458286,u7201,m485,CAPTAIN,You lie!
242625,L458285,u7212,m485,SPARROW,No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
242626,L458284,u7201,m485,CAPTAIN,But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
242627,L458283,u7212,m485,SPARROW,No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
242628,L458282,u7201,m485,CAPTAIN,You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
242629,L458010,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, thank goodness, that's settled."
242630,L458009,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I think so.
242631,L457999,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Yeah, but they leave you plenty."
242632,L457998,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you."
242633,L457997,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune."
242634,L457996,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?"
242635,L457995,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
242636,L457994,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
242637,L457993,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
242638,L457992,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,Why didn't you eat last night?
242639,L457991,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
242640,L457990,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,There's no hurry. It's early.
242641,L457924,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I'll have it for supper.  So long.
242642,L457923,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,But what about lunch?
242643,L457876,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
242644,L457875,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
242645,L457874,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
242646,L457873,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,You would.
242647,L457872,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water."
242648,L457871,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I don't agree with you.
242649,L457870,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
242650,L457869,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
242651,L457868,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
242652,L457844,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ..."
242653,L457843,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,Did you? Where?
242654,L457842,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
242655,L457841,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
242656,L457840,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet."
242657,L457839,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,What are you laughing at?
242658,L457838,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
242659,L457837,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?"
242660,L457836,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"Yes, why?"
242661,L458071,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton."
242662,L458070,u7210,m485,RALPH,That's the way I feel about it.
242663,L458069,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,So that's the way it is?
242664,L458068,u7210,m485,RALPH,"Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement."
242665,L458067,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I'd call it stupid at any time.
242666,L458066,u7210,m485,RALPH,You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
242667,L458061,u7210,m485,RALPH,"I'm not quarreling, only ..."
242668,L458060,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
242669,L458059,u7210,m485,RALPH,Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
242670,L458058,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--"
242671,L458057,u7210,m485,RALPH,"Well, I do say it."
242672,L458056,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I won't let you say that!
242673,L458055,u7210,m485,RALPH,What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
242674,L458054,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
242675,L458053,u7210,m485,RALPH,"She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence."
242676,L458052,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,But why? She's the best friend I've got.
242677,L457911,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"Delighted, I'm sure."
242678,L457910,u7210,m485,RALPH,"Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor."
242679,L457892,u7210,m485,RALPH,"Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight."
242680,L457891,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?"
242681,L458291,u7208,m485,IGOR,"And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now."
242682,L458290,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you."
242683,L458258,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,Ralph! Ralph!
242684,L458257,u7208,m485,IGOR,"We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid."
242685,L458256,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,Let me go! Let me go!
242686,L458250,u7208,m485,IGOR,"It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure."
242687,L458249,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble."
242688,L458248,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,I'd love to.
242689,L458247,u7208,m485,IGOR,"And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?"
242690,L458246,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,But it was really my fault.
242691,L458245,u7208,m485,IGOR,"Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you."
242692,L458244,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
242693,L458243,u7208,m485,IGOR,"Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night."
242694,L458242,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid."
242695,L458022,u7208,m485,IGOR,"They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night."
242696,L458021,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,But I think these things are beautiful.
242697,L457918,u7208,m485,IGOR,At any time. You will always be welcome.
242698,L457917,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,We'll be coming to the opening.
242699,L457915,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,"I'd love to, at any time."
242700,L457914,u7208,m485,IGOR,"Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?"
242701,L457913,u7202,m485,CHARLOTTE,Thank you.
242702,L457912,u7208,m485,IGOR,"If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you."
242703,L458162,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump."
242704,L458161,u7203,m485,DETECTIVE,"Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!"
242705,L458133,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!"
242706,L458132,u7203,m485,DETECTIVE,You mean he was colored?
242707,L458131,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask."
242708,L458122,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,How quaint. But I can go any place you can.
242709,L458121,u7203,m485,DETECTIVE,It happens that I'm the law.
242710,L458120,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Whatever you are, you're the only one of it."
242711,L458119,u7203,m485,DETECTIVE,What do you think I am?
242712,L458118,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant."
242713,L458113,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
242714,L458112,u7203,m485,DETECTIVE,Are you giving me this straight?
242715,L458111,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there."
242716,L458110,u7203,m485,DETECTIVE,"Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?"
242717,L458109,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,The body of Joan Gale!
242718,L458108,u7203,m485,DETECTIVE,What! What are you talking about?
242719,L458337,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!"
242720,L458336,u7204,m485,EDITOR,That's what I said.
242721,L458332,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me."
242722,L458331,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?"
242723,L458218,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!"
242724,L458217,u7204,m485,EDITOR,What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
242725,L458216,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
242726,L458215,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you."
242727,L458214,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in."
242728,L458213,u7204,m485,EDITOR,What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
242729,L458212,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire."
242730,L458211,u7204,m485,EDITOR,You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
242731,L458210,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Mit me, kid. I've got a classic."
242732,L457971,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket."
242733,L457970,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Almost certain.
242734,L457969,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,No kiddin'?
242735,L457968,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America."
242736,L457967,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,What do you mean?
242737,L457966,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up."
242738,L457965,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is."
242739,L457964,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
242740,L457963,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Let it go.
242741,L457962,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
242742,L457961,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!"
242743,L457960,u7204,m485,EDITOR,I used to be married to one.
242744,L457959,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?"
242745,L457958,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?"
242746,L457957,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,What!
242747,L457956,u7204,m485,EDITOR,We'll grant that.
242748,L457955,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy."
242749,L457954,u7204,m485,EDITOR,No kiddin'. What's your idea?
242750,L457953,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!"
242751,L457952,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that."
242752,L457951,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I asked you to keep your trap shut!
242753,L457950,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Now don't that call for an extra!
242754,L457949,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street."
242755,L457948,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it."
242756,L457947,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell."
242757,L457946,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right."
242758,L457945,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I am right! I know I'm right!
242759,L457942,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid."
242760,L457941,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it."
242761,L457938,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale."
242762,L457937,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
242763,L457936,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?"
242764,L457790,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Get out of here.
242765,L457789,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Which one is me? The horse?
242766,L457786,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
242767,L457785,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"No, there's another point I want to iron out."
242768,L457784,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
242769,L457783,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ..."
242770,L457781,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Nope, I'm through!"
242771,L457780,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Hey, come here, Sob-sister!"
242772,L457779,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else."
242773,L457778,u7204,m485,EDITOR,You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
242774,L457777,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?"
242775,L457776,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
242776,L457775,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
242777,L457774,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
242778,L457773,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,And they never proved anything against him.
242779,L457772,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --"
242780,L457771,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, I won't work on it from that angle."
242781,L457770,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore."
242782,L457769,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail."
242783,L457768,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians."
242784,L457767,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,You give me a pain!
242785,L457766,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page."
242786,L457765,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break."
242787,L457764,u7204,m485,EDITOR,And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
242788,L457763,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?"
242789,L457762,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him."
242790,L457761,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York."
242791,L457760,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow."
242792,L457635,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Quick, Watson, the cookbook!"
242793,L457634,u7204,m485,EDITOR,That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti!
242794,L457633,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?"
242795,L457631,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?"
242796,L457630,u7204,m485,EDITOR,"All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?"
242797,L457629,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!"
242798,L457628,u7204,m485,EDITOR,I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
242799,L457625,u7204,m485,EDITOR,That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
242800,L457624,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Meaning what?
242801,L457623,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
242802,L457622,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Charming. More delightful people crippled.
242803,L457621,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
242804,L457620,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
242805,L457619,u7204,m485,EDITOR,Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
242806,L457618,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
242807,L458231,u7212,m485,SPARROW,"Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!"
242808,L458230,u7205,m485,FIRST DETECTIVE,You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
242809,L458229,u7212,m485,SPARROW,"No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there."
242810,L458228,u7205,m485,FIRST DETECTIVE,"You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?"
242811,L458225,u7212,m485,SPARROW,"No, sir. About three months ago."
242812,L458224,u7205,m485,FIRST DETECTIVE,"Don't remember what day that was, do you?"
242813,L458223,u7212,m485,SPARROW,I don't remember. Not so very far--
242814,L458222,u7205,m485,FIRST DETECTIVE,Where were you going when you got in that cab?
242815,L458221,u7212,m485,SPARROW,"Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor."
242816,L457676,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Thanks.
242817,L457675,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,It's all yours.
242818,L457674,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Don't give this to anybody else, will you?"
242819,L457673,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
242820,L457672,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Make it snappy, Colonel."
242821,L457668,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Hotcha! Saved, one job!"
242822,L457667,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,"Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead."
242823,L457666,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,What does that prove?
242824,L457665,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
242825,L457664,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ..."
242826,L457663,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
242827,L457662,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
242828,L457661,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,That's the one.
242829,L457660,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Old Howard Winton's cub?
242830,L457659,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,Do you know George Winton?
242831,L457658,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,No foolin' -- any suspect?
242832,L457657,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,"Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!"
242833,L457656,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year."
242834,L457655,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
242835,L457654,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me."
242836,L457653,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,No kiddin'.
242837,L457652,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!"
242838,L457651,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
242839,L457650,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,How's every little thing?
242840,L457649,u7211,m485,SERGEANT,Call the Homicide Squad!
242841,L457640,u7209,m485,MAN,Here's a wow.
242842,L457639,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story."
242843,L457638,u7209,m485,MAN,I told you he was a sore.
242844,L457616,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
242845,L457615,u7209,m485,MAN,"Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore."
242846,L457614,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death."
242847,L457613,u7209,m485,MAN,What do you mean police dog?
242848,L457612,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
242849,L457611,u7209,m485,MAN,Where'd you get the stag hound?
242850,L458278,u7210,m485,RALPH,Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
242851,L458277,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Ralph, come here a minute, will you?"
242852,L458268,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
242853,L458267,u7210,m485,RALPH,"Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?"
242854,L458266,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time."
242855,L458265,u7210,m485,RALPH,I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
242856,L458264,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?"
242857,L458263,u7210,m485,RALPH,What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
242858,L457901,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Horsefeathers!
242859,L457900,u7210,m485,RALPH,"Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch."
242860,L457899,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
242861,L457898,u7210,m485,RALPH,"No use. He's a crab, I tell you."
242862,L457897,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,He might get some publicity out of it.
242863,L457890,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
242864,L457889,u7210,m485,RALPH,"Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you."
242865,L457888,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Fine, thanks."
242866,L458309,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Don't ask any questions. Come on!
242867,L458308,u7213,m485,WINTON,What is it? What happened?
242868,L458206,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!"
242869,L458205,u7213,m485,WINTON,Heaven knows. A lot.
242870,L458204,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,How much money have you got?
242871,L458203,u7213,m485,WINTON,You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
242872,L458202,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Oh, is that what caused it?"
242873,L458201,u7213,m485,WINTON,"No, really -- I'm crazy about you."
242874,L458200,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you."
242875,L458199,u7213,m485,WINTON,"I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you."
242876,L458198,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
242877,L458194,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Darned if I don't!
242878,L458193,u7213,m485,WINTON,You go in for dangerous things.
242879,L458192,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Why?
242880,L458144,u7213,m485,WINTON,No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it.
242881,L458143,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
242882,L458082,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
242883,L458081,u7213,m485,WINTON,Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
242884,L458080,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California."
242885,L458079,u7213,m485,WINTON,I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
242886,L458078,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me."
242887,L458077,u7213,m485,WINTON,Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
242888,L458076,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
242889,L458075,u7213,m485,WINTON,Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
242890,L457755,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,That's what they're going to ask you.
242891,L457754,u7213,m485,WINTON,Who'd steal her body?
242892,L457753,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,That happens to be the truth.
242893,L457752,u7213,m485,WINTON,Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
242894,L457751,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are."
242895,L457750,u7213,m485,WINTON,Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
242896,L457749,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue."
242897,L457748,u7213,m485,WINTON,No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
242898,L457747,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,You weren't going with her?
242899,L457746,u7213,m485,WINTON,We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
242900,L457745,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,I see. Was that all she said?
242901,L457744,u7213,m485,WINTON,"She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends."
242902,L457743,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
242903,L457742,u7213,m485,WINTON,They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
242904,L457741,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
242905,L457740,u7213,m485,WINTON,For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
242906,L457739,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
242907,L457738,u7213,m485,WINTON,"My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--"
242908,L457737,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,That's what I said.
242909,L457736,u7213,m485,WINTON,Cry-baby?
242910,L457735,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --"
242911,L457734,u7213,m485,WINTON,"Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you!"
242912,L457733,u7206,m485,FLORENCE,"Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty."
242913,L457732,u7213,m485,WINTON,Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before --
242914,L457545,u7208,m485,IGOR,Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
242915,L457544,u7207,m485,GOLATILY,"Good night, sir."
242916,L457543,u7208,m485,IGOR,It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
242917,L457542,u7207,m485,GOLATILY,"I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back."
242918,L457541,u7208,m485,IGOR,"You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?"
242919,L457540,u7207,m485,GOLATILY,"She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back."
242920,L457539,u7208,m485,IGOR,"My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her."
242921,L457538,u7207,m485,GOLATILY,"Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite."
242922,L457537,u7208,m485,IGOR,"You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine."
242923,L457574,u7214,m485,WORTH,Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done.
242924,L457573,u7208,m485,IGOR,You're insane.
242925,L457572,u7214,m485,WORTH,"Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!"
242926,L457571,u7208,m485,IGOR,And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
242927,L457570,u7214,m485,WORTH,"You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see."
242928,L457569,u7208,m485,IGOR,"And you think I will permit this, my friend?"
242929,L457568,u7214,m485,WORTH,I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
242930,L457565,u7208,m485,IGOR,You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ...
242931,L457564,u7214,m485,WORTH,I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
242932,L457563,u7208,m485,IGOR,"A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?"
242933,L457562,u7214,m485,WORTH,"Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds."
242934,L457561,u7208,m485,IGOR,Fire insurance!
242935,L457560,u7214,m485,WORTH,"No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these."
242936,L457559,u7208,m485,IGOR,Is that a fact?
242937,L457558,u7214,m485,WORTH,Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
242938,L457557,u7208,m485,IGOR,"Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this."
242939,L457554,u7208,m485,IGOR,That is unfortunate.
242940,L457553,u7214,m485,WORTH,"I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!"
242941,L458020,u7208,m485,IGOR,"Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present."
242942,L458019,u7210,m485,RALPH,"I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow."
242943,L457885,u7210,m485,RALPH,"All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front."
242944,L457884,u7208,m485,IGOR,"If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good."
242945,L457883,u7210,m485,RALPH,I will only be gone about half an hour.
242946,L457882,u7208,m485,IGOR,That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
242947,L457881,u7210,m485,RALPH,But I have some friends waiting.
242948,L457880,u7208,m485,IGOR,"To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening."
242949,L457879,u7210,m485,RALPH,To lunch.
242950,L457808,u7208,m485,IGOR,If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
242951,L457807,u7210,m485,RALPH,But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
242952,L457806,u7208,m485,IGOR,"Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long."
242953,L457805,u7210,m485,RALPH,That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
242954,L457804,u7208,m485,IGOR,"And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy."
242955,L457803,u7210,m485,RALPH,One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
242956,L457802,u7208,m485,IGOR,"If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?"
242957,L458018,u7208,m485,IGOR,Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
242958,L458017,u7212,m485,SPARROW,I'd know him anywhere.
242959,L457933,u7208,m485,IGOR,He can't hear you.
242960,L457932,u7212,m485,SPARROW,What are you laughing at?
242961,L457931,u7212,m485,SPARROW,I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
242962,L457930,u7208,m485,IGOR,She is the soul of that statue.
242963,L457828,u7208,m485,IGOR,"You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come."
242964,L457827,u7212,m485,SPARROW,"I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon."
242965,L457822,u7208,m485,IGOR,Yes.
242966,L457821,u7212,m485,SPARROW,Shall we unpack it?
242967,L457817,u7208,m485,IGOR,Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
242968,L457816,u7212,m485,SPARROW,"Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help."
242969,L457815,u7208,m485,IGOR,Have you got it? Is it completed?
242970,L457980,u7213,m485,WINTON,Thanks.
242971,L457979,u7214,m485,WORTH,"Well, any time I can do anything for you --"
242972,L457978,u7213,m485,WINTON,"They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about."
242973,L457977,u7214,m485,WORTH,I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
242974,L457976,u7213,m485,WINTON,"Good. Well, I'll be seeing you."
242975,L457975,u7214,m485,WORTH,Yep. Everything settled.
242976,L456403,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,Yes....
242977,L456402,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Mia...?
242978,L456401,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,What was her name?  The one I met.
242979,L456400,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Excuse me???
242980,L456399,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,What was her name?
242981,L456398,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,"-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?"
242982,L456397,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,You did miss --
242983,L456396,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
242984,L456395,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,You did.
242985,L456394,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,Two: what if I didn't miss?
242986,L456393,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Dad...
242987,L456392,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
242988,L456391,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,You taking any medication?
242989,L456390,u7215,m486,ALEXANDER,To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
242990,L456426,u7216,m486,MIA,So I can move on.  You too.
242991,L456425,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Why?
242992,L456421,u7216,m486,MIA,What?
242993,L456420,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Then you get it.  You'll understand.
242994,L456419,u7216,m486,MIA,I've been dreaming about this.
242995,L456418,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Wait.  I want to tell you something.
242996,L456417,u7216,m486,MIA,I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
242997,L456379,u7216,m486,MIA,And glow happily ever after.
242998,L456378,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,"That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --"
242999,L456377,u7216,m486,MIA,Dysfunctional --
243000,L456376,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
243001,L456375,u7216,m486,MIA,"She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --"
243002,L456373,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,"Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier..."
243003,L456372,u7216,m486,MIA,No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
243004,L456369,u7216,m486,MIA,Like now?
243005,L456368,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,"That's what it asked me.  ""What do you want?""  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment."
243006,L456367,u7216,m486,MIA,What did it want?
243007,L456362,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
243008,L456361,u7216,m486,MIA,Of what?
243009,L456352,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,How?
243010,L456351,u7216,m486,MIA,The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
243011,L456350,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Nothing is real until it's perceived.
243012,L456347,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,A quantum one.
243013,L456346,u7216,m486,MIA,"What universe are you in, Paul?"
243014,L456345,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Could be.
243015,L456343,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,"At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways."
243016,L456342,u7216,m486,MIA,We flopped the first time out.
243017,L456341,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,It's an experiment.
243018,L456340,u7216,m486,MIA,Why am I doing this?
243019,L456339,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,That's the physicist's playground.
243020,L456338,u7216,m486,MIA,A place you've never been.
243021,L456337,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Where to?
243022,L456336,u7216,m486,MIA,Could you?
243023,L456335,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,I could go out of town.
243024,L456334,u7216,m486,MIA,What?
243025,L456333,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Okay.
243026,L456332,u7216,m486,MIA,I'm heading out of town.
243027,L456331,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,Could we go somewhere?
243028,L456326,u7216,m486,MIA,Day or night?
243029,L456325,u7217,m486,PENTCHO,I've been dreaming about you.
243030,L460182,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
243031,L460181,u7218,m487,BILLY,Where is she?
243032,L460180,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours."
243033,L460179,u7218,m487,BILLY,"Well, I got to see her."
243034,L460178,u7226,m487,MOTHER,She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
243035,L460177,u7218,m487,BILLY,Is Rose here?
243036,L460176,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Yes?
243037,L460057,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that."
243038,L460056,u7219,m487,BROTHER,"Oh, Mother, not the castor oil."
243039,L460055,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
243040,L460054,u7219,m487,BROTHER,"I am in awe of it, Mother."
243041,L460053,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it."
243042,L460052,u7219,m487,BROTHER,"I know, Mother."
243043,L460051,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it."
243044,L460050,u7219,m487,BROTHER,"They're filthy, Mother."
243045,L460597,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love."
243046,L460596,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose."
243047,L460595,u7227,m487,ROSE,"A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it."
243048,L460594,u7220,m487,BUDDY,What was your mother like?
243049,L460593,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy."
243050,L460592,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right."
243051,L460591,u7227,m487,ROSE,"He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up."
243052,L460590,u7220,m487,BUDDY,How did the rabbits kill him?
243053,L460589,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him."
243054,L460588,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Five hundred rabbits?
243055,L460587,u7227,m487,ROSE,Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
243056,L460586,u7220,m487,BUDDY,They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
243057,L460585,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?"
243058,L460584,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Take a little walk with me, huh?"
243059,L460583,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"What are you going to do, Rose?"
243060,L460582,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun."
243061,L460581,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Okay.
243062,L460580,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?"
243063,L460524,u7227,m487,ROSE,I don't want to know...
243064,L460523,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it."
243065,L460509,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!"
243066,L460508,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"You won't die, Rose."
243067,L460507,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!"
243068,L460361,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas."
243069,L460360,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people."
243070,L460359,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared."
243071,L460358,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Yeah, I'd believe it."
243072,L460357,u7227,m487,ROSE,He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
243073,L460356,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy."
243074,L460355,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, ""You know, you are beautiful."" Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?"
243075,L460354,u7220,m487,BUDDY,He did?
243076,L460353,u7227,m487,ROSE,"You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat."
243077,L460352,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, you are too uncritical of people."
243078,L460351,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!"
243079,L460210,u7227,m487,ROSE,But I don't know who they are.
243080,L460209,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you."
243081,L460208,u7227,m487,ROSE,I got an awful toothache.
243082,L460172,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't."
243083,L460171,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, you must know who the fellow is."
243084,L460116,u7227,m487,ROSE,You're my sweetheart.
243085,L460115,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Yeah.
243086,L460114,u7227,m487,ROSE,Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
243087,L460079,u7227,m487,ROSE,I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
243088,L460078,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Here comes Daddy.
243089,L460046,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!"
243090,L460045,u7220,m487,BUDDY,You're going to get yourself up and go out?
243091,L460044,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out."
243092,L460042,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time..."
243093,L460041,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!"
243094,L460038,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me..."
243095,L460037,u7220,m487,BUDDY,I said I wouldn't.
243096,L460036,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me."
243097,L460022,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Good night, Rose."
243098,L460021,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night."
243099,L460020,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul."
243100,L460019,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?"
243101,L460018,u7227,m487,ROSE,"No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!"
243102,L460017,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?"
243103,L460013,u7227,m487,ROSE,"You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?"
243104,L460012,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"But why, if I'm not hurting you?"
243105,L460011,u7227,m487,ROSE,"No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it."
243106,L460010,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Am I hurting you?
243107,L460009,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it."
243108,L460008,u7220,m487,BUDDY,But Rose...
243109,L460007,u7227,m487,ROSE,You better quit that.
243110,L460003,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, nothin'."
243111,L460002,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?"
243112,L460001,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, you're just a child."
243113,L460000,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport."
243114,L459999,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me."
243115,L459998,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you."
243116,L459997,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!"
243117,L459996,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?"
243118,L459995,u7227,m487,ROSE,No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
243119,L459994,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?"
243120,L459993,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat."
243121,L459992,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose."
243122,L459991,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?"
243123,L459990,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty..."
243124,L459989,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys."
243125,L459988,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you."
243126,L459987,u7227,m487,ROSE,"There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him."
243127,L459986,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose."
243128,L459985,u7227,m487,ROSE,"You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you."
243129,L459984,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, some fiend might."
243130,L459983,u7227,m487,ROSE,Who would want to do such a thing as that?
243131,L459982,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot."
243132,L459981,u7227,m487,ROSE,Don't mention it.
243133,L459980,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose."
243134,L459979,u7227,m487,ROSE,"All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk."
243135,L459978,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn."
243136,L459977,u7227,m487,ROSE,'Course it does.
243137,L459976,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right."
243138,L459975,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?"
243139,L459974,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot."
243140,L459973,u7227,m487,ROSE,You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
243141,L459972,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like."
243142,L459971,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice."
243143,L459970,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?"
243144,L459968,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"But I'm curious, Rose."
243145,L459967,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things."
243146,L459966,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?"
243147,L459965,u7227,m487,ROSE,"No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me."
243148,L459964,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?"
243149,L459963,u7227,m487,ROSE,"You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next."
243150,L459962,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Actually, I am, though."
243151,L459961,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things."
243152,L459960,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"There's some kind of gristle in it, though."
243153,L459959,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe."
243154,L459958,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe."
243155,L459957,u7227,m487,ROSE,What did you expect?
243156,L459956,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft."
243157,L459954,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me."
243158,L459953,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?"
243159,L459952,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!"
243160,L459951,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?"
243161,L459950,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill."
243162,L459949,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"You were pretty bad, huh?"
243163,L459948,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so..."
243164,L459947,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"What'd you do, Rose?"
243165,L459946,u7227,m487,ROSE,"It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was."
243166,L459945,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"What is it, Rose?"
243167,L459944,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make."
243168,L459943,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, all right."
243169,L459942,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?"
243170,L459941,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"No, I'm awake. What's the matter?"
243171,L459820,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio."
243172,L459819,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose."
243173,L459818,u7227,m487,ROSE,I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
243174,L459817,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her."
243175,L459816,u7227,m487,ROSE,I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
243176,L459815,u7220,m487,BUDDY,There was this old man that ate his niece.
243177,L459814,u7227,m487,ROSE,What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
243178,L459813,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?"
243179,L459812,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world."
243180,L459811,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?"
243181,L459809,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
243182,L459808,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it."
243183,L459807,u7220,m487,BUDDY,In what sense were they bad?
243184,L459806,u7227,m487,ROSE,"They were just bad men, that's all."
243185,L459805,u7220,m487,BUDDY,But who were they?
243186,L459804,u7227,m487,ROSE,Nobody.
243187,L459803,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?"
243188,L459775,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
243189,L459774,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?"
243190,L459773,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Lots of things. Buddy, mostly."
243191,L460321,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about."
243192,L460320,u7228,m487,WASKI,Of course not!
243193,L460070,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!"
243194,L460069,u7228,m487,WASKI,"He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!"
243195,L459878,u7228,m487,WASKI,Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
243196,L459877,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"All right, what do you know?"
243197,L459876,u7228,m487,WASKI,"I do, too!"
243198,L459875,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Oh, Waski, you don't know anything."
243199,L459874,u7228,m487,WASKI,"Yeah, I know."
243200,L459857,u7228,m487,WASKI,"I do, too."
243201,L459856,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about."
243202,L459855,u7228,m487,WASKI,Neither do I.
243203,L460602,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car."
243204,L460601,u7220,m487,BUDDY,I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
243205,L460416,u7221,m487,DADDY,"She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!"
243206,L460415,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Daddy, what's the matter?"
243207,L460414,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Open that door, damn you!"
243208,L460401,u7221,m487,DADDY,And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
243209,L460400,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Well... maybe...
243210,L460399,u7221,m487,DADDY,"See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder."
243211,L460398,u7221,m487,DADDY,"True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with."
243212,L460397,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it."
243213,L460396,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?"
243214,L460395,u7220,m487,BUDDY,But how would you find him?
243215,L460394,u7221,m487,DADDY,"That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?"
243216,L460393,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, it's not very plain."
243217,L460392,u7221,m487,DADDY,"See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here."
243218,L460381,u7221,m487,DADDY,"He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose."
243219,L460380,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again."
243220,L460379,u7221,m487,DADDY,"What do you think, Brother?"
243221,L460369,u7221,m487,DADDY,What's taking the rascal so long?
243222,L460368,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Yeah, he's still up there."
243223,L460367,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Is that Doctor still up there, Brother."
243224,L460152,u7221,m487,DADDY,The girl strikes like a cobra.
243225,L460151,u7220,m487,BUDDY,I don't know.
243226,L460150,u7221,m487,DADDY,I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
243227,L460139,u7220,m487,BUDDY,No. Why should Rose be in my room?
243228,L460138,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Son, was Rose in your room last night?"
243229,L460134,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, yeah."
243230,L460133,u7221,m487,DADDY,Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
243231,L460132,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Well, a little."
243232,L460131,u7221,m487,DADDY,"You were up late last night, Brother."
243233,L460375,u7220,m487,BUDDY,I'll be right back.
243234,L460374,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this."
243235,L460373,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom."
243236,L460096,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
243237,L460095,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Heh, what a hypocrite."
243238,L460075,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty..."
243239,L460074,u7220,m487,BUDDY,She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
243240,L460073,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"What'd you say, Brother?"
243241,L460072,u7220,m487,BUDDY,She's getting herself up to go out.
243242,L460071,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?"
243243,L460066,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff."
243244,L460065,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"No, you didn't say that, Brother."
243245,L460064,u7220,m487,BUDDY,I said ahhh-dam stuff.
243246,L460063,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"What did you say, Brother?"
243247,L460062,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Uhhh, gahdam stuff!"
243248,L460061,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it."
243249,L460060,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!"
243250,L460059,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this."
243251,L460058,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?"
243252,L460049,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image."
243253,L460048,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books."
243254,L460047,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?"
243255,L459784,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski."
243256,L459783,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel."
243257,L459782,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?"
243258,L459781,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed."
243259,L459780,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed."
243260,L459779,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't."
243261,L459778,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?"
243262,L459777,u7220,m487,BUDDY,The new girl is here.
243263,L460564,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Here comes Daddy.
243264,L460563,u7223,m487,DOLL,Why is it taking so long?
243265,L460506,u7223,m487,DOLL,If it isn't a baby... what is it?
243266,L460505,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it."
243267,L460504,u7223,m487,DOLL,A baby... and she isn't even married.
243268,L460503,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so."
243269,L460502,u7223,m487,DOLL,What's goin' on?
243270,L460411,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house."
243271,L460410,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that."
243272,L460319,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Doll, don't ask childish questions."
243273,L460318,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Buddy... does Rose really... ""do it"" with all those boys and men?"
243274,L460317,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close."
243275,L460316,u7223,m487,DOLL,What's happening?
243276,L460298,u7223,m487,DOLL,"You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!"
243277,L460297,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on."
243278,L460296,u7223,m487,DOLL,What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
243279,L460194,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --"
243280,L460193,u7223,m487,DOLL,Then why does she act so dumb?
243281,L460192,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average."
243282,L460191,u7223,m487,DOLL,"She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb."
243283,L460190,u7220,m487,BUDDY,So am I.
243284,L460189,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Buddy, I'm worried about Rose."
243285,L460188,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri."
243286,L460068,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts"
243287,L460067,u7223,m487,DOLL,"No, Mother, he's lying..."
243288,L459938,u7223,m487,DOLL,"You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick."
243289,L459937,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him."
243290,L459936,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?"
243291,L459932,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"You shouldn't watch such things, Doll."
243292,L459931,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting."
243293,L459928,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Buddy, that was my place."
243294,L459927,u7220,m487,BUDDY,She's putting the titty back.
243295,L459924,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Let me look.  Aww-rr...
243296,L459923,u7223,m487,DOLL,He had his hand on her titty.
243297,L459922,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Is that all?
243298,L459921,u7223,m487,DOLL,He kissed her.
243299,L459920,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"What are they doing, Doll?"
243300,L459919,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it."
243301,L459918,u7220,m487,BUDDY,What are they doing?
243302,L459917,u7223,m487,DOLL,Wow! Brrrother!
243303,L459916,u7223,m487,DOLL,Boy! Wow!
243304,L459915,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Now I can't see. What are they doing?
243305,L459914,u7223,m487,DOLL,Let me see!
243306,L459913,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!"
243307,L459912,u7223,m487,DOLL,Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
243308,L459911,u7220,m487,BUDDY,This is my place and you can't have it.
243309,L459910,u7223,m487,DOLL,"I can't see, let me see..."
243310,L459909,u7220,m487,BUDDY,They're discussing it.
243311,L459908,u7223,m487,DOLL,"I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?"
243312,L459898,u7220,m487,BUDDY,At least.
243313,L459897,u7223,m487,DOLL,I think she's gonna kiss him.
243314,L459896,u7223,m487,DOLL,Okay.
243315,L459895,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Let's go peep from the living room.
243316,L459894,u7223,m487,DOLL,Yeah.
243317,L459893,u7220,m487,BUDDY,There goes Mother.
243318,L459873,u7223,m487,DOLL,I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
243319,L459872,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Yeah.
243320,L459871,u7223,m487,DOLL,She's watching the car again?
243321,L459870,u7220,m487,BUDDY,It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
243322,L459869,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"No, he doesn't. Not really."
243323,L459868,u7223,m487,DOLL,I think Daddy suspects.
243324,L459867,u7220,m487,BUDDY,It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
243325,L459854,u7223,m487,DOLL,No.
243326,L459853,u7220,m487,BUDDY,"Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?"
243327,L459822,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Oh, shut up, Buddy."
243328,L459821,u7220,m487,BUDDY,Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
243329,L460685,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,I'm not blubbering.
243330,L460684,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?"
243331,L460683,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?"
243332,L460682,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?"
243333,L460681,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?"
243334,L460678,u7221,m487,DADDY,"It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,"
243335,L460677,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it."
243336,L460676,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe."
243337,L460675,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop."
243338,L460674,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Excuse me, I'll be right back."
243339,L460673,u7221,m487,DADDY,"She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything."
243340,L460672,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
243341,L460671,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened."
243342,L460670,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?"
243343,L460669,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No, son, she is dead."
243344,L460668,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?"
243345,L460667,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that."
243346,L460666,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny."
243347,L460665,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already."
243348,L460664,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here."
243349,L460663,u7221,m487,DADDY,"A wonderful woman, boy."
243350,L460662,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,That's what she would say herself.
243351,L460661,u7221,m487,DADDY,"At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son."
243352,L460660,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?"
243353,L460659,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life."
243354,L460658,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"He didn't lose her, he threw her away."
243355,L460657,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose."
243356,L460656,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C."
243357,L460655,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?"
243358,L460654,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
243359,L460653,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?"
243360,L460652,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,Is her husband sick or something?
243361,L460651,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son."
243362,L460650,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
243363,L460649,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news."
243364,L460648,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?"
243365,L460646,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
243366,L460645,u7221,m487,DADDY,"How could that be, son?"
243367,L460644,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
243368,L460643,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion."
243369,L460642,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator."
243370,L460641,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Are they polar bears, too?"
243371,L460640,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Yeah, they're in the snow."
243372,L460639,u7221,m487,DADDY,Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
243373,L460638,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
243374,L460636,u7221,m487,DADDY,It's Yankee whisky to me.
243375,L460635,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch."
243376,L460634,u7221,m487,DADDY,"About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?"
243377,L460633,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Hello, Daddy. How are you?"
243378,L460632,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?"
243379,L460538,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Yes, we know her."
243380,L460537,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,I think we both know her.
243381,L460536,u7221,m487,DADDY,Of course.
243382,L460535,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
243383,L460534,u7221,m487,DADDY,Please do.
243384,L460533,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?"
243385,L460532,u7221,m487,DADDY,I am ahead of you.
243386,L460529,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Go on, Doctor."
243387,L460528,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children."
243388,L460527,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you."
243389,L460520,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you."
243390,L460519,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been."
243391,L460518,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl."
243392,L460517,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?"
243393,L460342,u7221,m487,DADDY,"That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt."
243394,L460341,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment."
243395,L460626,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him."
243396,L460625,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Honey, he is Mr. Right."
243397,L460624,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows."
243398,L460623,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!"
243399,L460607,u7221,m487,DADDY,"You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died."
243400,L460606,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Who?
243401,L460605,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,"
243402,L460600,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?"
243403,L460599,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
243404,L460598,u7221,m487,DADDY,It's twenty after one.
243405,L460567,u7221,m487,DADDY,Fine.
243406,L460566,u7226,m487,MOTHER,How is she?
243407,L460552,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?"
243408,L460551,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off."
243409,L460550,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so."
243410,L460549,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and..."
243411,L460548,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?"
243412,L460547,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself."
243413,L460546,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?"
243414,L460542,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Over... my... dead... body!
243415,L460541,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!"
243416,L460522,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear."
243417,L460521,u7226,m487,MOTHER,This conversation is making me a little sick.
243418,L460501,u7221,m487,DADDY,I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
243419,L460500,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
243420,L460495,u7221,m487,DADDY,"She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly."
243421,L460494,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Honey!
243422,L460485,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!"
243423,L460484,u7226,m487,MOTHER,What did you forget?
243424,L460483,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something."
243425,L460479,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?"
243426,L460478,u7221,m487,DADDY,"She already told you, she doesn't know."
243427,L460477,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?"
243428,L460476,u7221,m487,DADDY,"You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?"
243429,L460473,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?"
243430,L460472,u7221,m487,DADDY,"This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded."
243431,L460461,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!"
243432,L460460,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery."
243433,L460459,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!"
243434,L460458,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word ""farm"" means to her?"
243435,L460457,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!"
243436,L460456,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --"
243437,L460448,u7221,m487,DADDY,Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
243438,L460447,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go."
243439,L460446,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?"
243440,L460444,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas."
243441,L460443,u7226,m487,MOTHER,She does look a little peaky.
243442,L460438,u7221,m487,DADDY,The hell we can't.
243443,L460437,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street."
243444,L460436,u7221,m487,DADDY,"It has been three weeks since I ""fired"" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?"
243445,L460408,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?"
243446,L460407,u7226,m487,MOTHER,She hasn't actually done anything...
243447,L460391,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something."
243448,L460390,u7226,m487,MOTHER,She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
243449,L460372,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do."
243450,L460371,u7221,m487,DADDY,I don't care where the polecat studied.
243451,L460370,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University."
243452,L460350,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I don't see how you can even think of it now.
243453,L460349,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her."
243454,L460348,u7221,m487,DADDY,"He's a polecat, dear."
243455,L460347,u7226,m487,MOTHER,You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
243456,L460346,u7221,m487,DADDY,I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
243457,L460336,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Honey, please..."
243458,L460335,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?"
243459,L460315,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her."
243460,L460314,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Darlin', Rose has got to go!"
243461,L460313,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative."
243462,L460312,u7221,m487,DADDY,"They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that."
243463,L460311,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her."
243464,L460310,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, I have a pretty good idea."
243465,L460309,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?"
243466,L460306,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it..."
243467,L460305,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension."
243468,L460304,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really."
243469,L460303,u7221,m487,DADDY,"That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'."
243470,L460302,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
243471,L460301,u7221,m487,DADDY,"It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house."
243472,L460300,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her."
243473,L460299,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do."
243474,L460238,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist."
243475,L460237,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all."
243476,L460236,u7226,m487,MOTHER,It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
243477,L460235,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I don't intend to fire her, darlin'."
243478,L460234,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!"
243479,L460233,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Now you listen to me, Rose --"
243480,L460229,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it."
243481,L460228,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!"
243482,L460227,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?"
243483,L460226,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!"
243484,L460225,u7221,m487,DADDY,Boys? You say to me boys?
243485,L460224,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys."
243486,L460223,u7221,m487,DADDY,-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
243487,L460222,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --"
243488,L460221,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen."
243489,L460220,u7221,m487,DADDY,I am not being brutal to her!
243490,L460219,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
243491,L460218,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!"
243492,L460187,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe."
243493,L460186,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon."
243494,L460184,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show."
243495,L460183,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away."
243496,L460164,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Yes, darlin', time will tell."
243497,L460163,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, time will tell, won't it?"
243498,L460162,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later."
243499,L460161,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her."
243500,L460160,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No reason at all, darlin'."
243501,L460159,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
243502,L460157,u7221,m487,DADDY,I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
243503,L460156,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Is she all right?
243504,L460155,u7221,m487,DADDY,Quarter of twelve.
243505,L460154,u7226,m487,MOTHER,What time is it?
243506,L460153,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, she's back."
243507,L460128,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Yes, of course."
243508,L460127,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course."
243509,L460126,u7221,m487,DADDY,"You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best."
243510,L460125,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard."
243511,L460124,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody."
243512,L460123,u7226,m487,MOTHER,He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
243513,L460122,u7221,m487,DADDY,"That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why."
243514,L460121,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it."
243515,L460120,u7221,m487,DADDY,She will succeed.
243516,L460119,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention."
243517,L460118,u7221,m487,DADDY,"The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her."
243518,L460117,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better."
243519,L460111,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer."
243520,L460110,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road."
243521,L460109,u7226,m487,MOTHER,You're not having lunch?
243522,L460108,u7221,m487,DADDY,Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
243523,L460107,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place."
243524,L460106,u7221,m487,DADDY,They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
243525,L460099,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride."
243526,L460098,u7226,m487,MOTHER,I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
243527,L460097,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother."
243528,L460087,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful."
243529,L460086,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose."
243530,L460005,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep."
243531,L460004,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?"
243532,L459891,u7221,m487,DADDY,"All right, darlin'."
243533,L459890,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well."
243534,L459889,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole."
243535,L459866,u7221,m487,DADDY,"You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out."
243536,L459865,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
243537,L459864,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do."
243538,L459863,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out."
243539,L459862,u7221,m487,DADDY,"All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension."
243540,L459861,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative."
243541,L459860,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house."
243542,L459859,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
243543,L459858,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'."
243544,L459850,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them."
243545,L459849,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about."
243546,L459848,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet."
243547,L459847,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her."
243548,L459846,u7221,m487,DADDY,Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
243549,L459845,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect."
243550,L459844,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while."
243551,L459843,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Oh. Did you say something?
243552,L459842,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake."
243553,L459841,u7226,m487,MOTHER,What?
243554,L459840,u7221,m487,DADDY,Turn up your hearing aid.
243555,L459839,u7221,m487,DADDY,"What do you think of her, honey?"
243556,L459838,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here."
243557,L459837,u7221,m487,DADDY,"How goes it, darlin'?"
243558,L459836,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside."
243559,L459835,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day."
243560,L459796,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm."
243561,L459795,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth."
243562,L460575,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Nothing, Rose."
243563,L460574,u7227,m487,ROSE,"What was it, Mr. Hillyer?"
243564,L460573,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it."
243565,L460571,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer."
243566,L460570,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous."
243567,L460569,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital."
243568,L460568,u7221,m487,DADDY,"You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?"
243569,L460493,u7221,m487,DADDY,"All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!"
243570,L460492,u7227,m487,ROSE,"It's so, Mr. Hillyer."
243571,L460491,u7221,m487,DADDY,I don't believe it.
243572,L460490,u7227,m487,ROSE,I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
243573,L460489,u7221,m487,DADDY,"All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?"
243574,L460488,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am."
243575,L460487,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No, you're not."
243576,L460486,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, I am."
243577,L460470,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her."
243578,L460469,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, mine. I'm going to have one."
243579,L460468,u7221,m487,DADDY,Your baby?
243580,L460467,u7227,m487,ROSE,Mine.
243581,L460466,u7221,m487,DADDY,What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
243582,L460463,u7221,m487,DADDY,What?
243583,L460462,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else."
243584,L460455,u7221,m487,DADDY,"No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!"
243585,L460454,u7227,m487,ROSE,You mean a farm?
243586,L460453,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job."
243587,L460452,u7227,m487,ROSE,Well. What kinda job is it?
243588,L460451,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!"
243589,L460450,u7227,m487,ROSE,Tennessee?
243590,L460449,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!"
243591,L460442,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir."
243592,L460441,u7221,m487,DADDY,"God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick."
243593,L460435,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?"
243594,L460434,u7227,m487,ROSE,"What's the use, there ain't none."
243595,L460433,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?"
243596,L460432,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired."
243597,L460431,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?"
243598,L460429,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?"
243599,L460428,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?"
243600,L460427,u7227,m487,ROSE,"He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman."
243601,L460426,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, it was a silly question."
243602,L460425,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go."
243603,L460424,u7221,m487,DADDY,"And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?"
243604,L460423,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, it's Billy."
243605,L460422,u7221,m487,DADDY,"And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?"
243606,L460421,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!"
243607,L460420,u7227,m487,ROSE,"There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!"
243608,L460406,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir."
243609,L460405,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?"
243610,L460295,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, air."
243611,L460294,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I will see you at suppertime, Rose."
243612,L460293,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't."
243613,L460292,u7221,m487,DADDY,"I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose."
243614,L460291,u7227,m487,ROSE,I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
243615,L460287,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him."
243616,L460286,u7221,m487,DADDY,"That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?"
243617,L460285,u7227,m487,ROSE,I got an awful bad cold.
243618,L460273,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, no, sir."
243619,L460272,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose."
243620,L460271,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!"
243621,L460270,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it."
243622,L460269,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled."
243623,L460268,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?"
243624,L460244,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir."
243625,L460243,u7221,m487,DADDY,"All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?"
243626,L460242,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir."
243627,L460241,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?"
243628,L460232,u7227,m487,ROSE,I'm not hungry.
243629,L460231,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!"
243630,L460230,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Ohhh-hh, ohhh..."
243631,L460215,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer."
243632,L460214,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir."
243633,L460213,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Strange voices, Rose?"
243634,L460212,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night."
243635,L460211,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?"
243636,L460146,u7227,m487,ROSE,"It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later."
243637,L460145,u7221,m487,DADDY,Is this ill right?
243638,L460144,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there."
243639,L460143,u7221,m487,DADDY,You don't know where you're going?
243640,L460142,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, anywhere downtown."
243641,L460141,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?"
243642,L460136,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom."
243643,L460135,u7221,m487,DADDY,"You were up late last night, too, Rose."
243644,L460130,u7227,m487,ROSE,"My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose."
243645,L460129,u7221,m487,DADDY,"What have you got in your hair, girl?"
243646,L460104,u7227,m487,ROSE,There are more on the other side.
243647,L460103,u7221,m487,DADDY,How can the buttons stand the pressure?
243648,L460102,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, it has buttons."
243649,L460101,u7221,m487,DADDY,"That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on."
243650,L460091,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours."
243651,L460090,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens."
243652,L460089,u7221,m487,DADDY,"If you've got time before you go ""out,"" get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup."
243653,L460088,u7227,m487,ROSE,You're so sweet.
243654,L460085,u7227,m487,ROSE,Yeah. I'm goin' out.
243655,L460084,u7221,m487,DADDY,Got yourself up?
243656,L460083,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all."
243657,L460027,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Well, good night."
243658,L460026,u7227,m487,ROSE,"No, sir."
243659,L460025,u7221,m487,DADDY,Is anything wrong?
243660,L460024,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom."
243661,L460023,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rose, what are you doing up?"
243662,L459935,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!"
243663,L459934,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me..."
243664,L459933,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?"
243665,L459930,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry..."
243666,L459929,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?"
243667,L459907,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ..."
243668,L459906,u7227,m487,ROSE,Don't make me... me... me... get up!
243669,L459905,u7221,m487,DADDY,"All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it."
243670,L459904,u7227,m487,ROSE,"No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much..."
243671,L459903,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!"
243672,L459902,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!"
243673,L459901,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?"
243674,L459884,u7227,m487,ROSE,I... I'll get the grits.
243675,L459883,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?"
243676,L459882,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, I don't know, I... I..."
243677,L459881,u7221,m487,DADDY,"Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?"
243678,L459800,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir."
243679,L459799,u7221,m487,DADDY,"All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?"
243680,L459798,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, sir."
243681,L459766,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane."
243682,L459765,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"What do you want me to tell her, Dave?"
243683,L459764,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters."
243684,L459762,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years."
243685,L459761,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?"
243686,L459760,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Yeah, I'll do that, Dave."
243687,L459759,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy."
243688,L459757,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Yeah, I remember it."
243689,L459756,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?"
243690,L459755,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him."
243691,L459754,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands."
243692,L459753,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
243693,L459752,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?"
243694,L459751,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs."
243695,L459750,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac."
243696,L459749,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!"
243697,L459748,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Well, no, I didn't actually."
243698,L459747,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?"
243699,L459746,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Um-m, well..."
243700,L459745,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me."
243701,L459744,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,I see. Outside it.
243702,L459743,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it."
243703,L459742,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building."
243704,L459740,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"She has other things to do, Dave."
243705,L459739,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,Took your time gettin' here.
243706,L459737,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place."
243707,L459736,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet."
243708,L459735,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?"
243709,L459734,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me."
243710,L459733,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?"
243711,L459732,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Oh, yeah?"
243712,L459731,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"How about that. Well, you always were a screwball."
243713,L459730,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,Page proof of a book I'm working on.
243714,L459729,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,Galley what?
243715,L459728,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,Galley proof.
243716,L459727,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?"
243717,L459725,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse."
243718,L459724,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town."
243719,L459723,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side."
243720,L459722,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?"
243721,L459721,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?"
243722,L459720,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,"Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see..."
243723,L459719,u7222,m487,DAVE WILKIE,"Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!"
243724,L459718,u7229,m487,WILLCOX HILLYER,Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
243725,L460629,u7223,m487,DOLL,I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
243726,L460628,u7226,m487,MOTHER,What's the matter with him?
243727,L460094,u7223,m487,DOLL,"I'm only trying to help him, Mother."
243728,L460093,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear."
243729,L460092,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy."
243730,L460032,u7223,m487,DOLL,"Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?"
243731,L460031,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Yes, dear, what is it?"
243732,L459791,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?"
243733,L459790,u7223,m487,DOLL,"I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran."
243734,L460560,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight."
243735,L460559,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect."
243736,L460558,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry."
243737,L460557,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely."
243738,L460556,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?"
243739,L460545,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?"
243740,L460544,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Illusions, Madam?"
243741,L460543,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
243742,L460540,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me."
243743,L460539,u7226,m487,MOTHER,What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
243744,L460531,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?"
243745,L460530,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Yes, go on."
243746,L460526,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?"
243747,L460525,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well."
243748,L460516,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts."
243749,L460515,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die."
243750,L460514,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her."
243751,L460513,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had."
243752,L460512,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren."
243753,L460511,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Gonorrhea?
243754,L460510,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated."
243755,L460364,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
243756,L460363,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Let me be the judge of that, Madam."
243757,L460362,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now."
243758,L460344,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean ""epi-zoo-ot-tics,"" an animal epidemic?"
243759,L460343,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Yes, thank you, Doctor."
243760,L460338,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth."
243761,L460337,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically."
243762,L460334,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm."
243763,L460333,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all."
243764,L460332,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
243765,L460331,u7226,m487,MOTHER,Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
243766,L460330,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,Afraid of the hospital?
243767,L460329,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital."
243768,L460328,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
243769,L460327,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"She looks terrible, just awful."
243770,L460326,u7224,m487,DR. MARTINSON,"Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many."
243771,L460263,u7225,m487,DR. WINTON,"I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home."
243772,L460262,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die."
243773,L460261,u7225,m487,DR. WINTON,"Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia."
243774,L460260,u7226,m487,MOTHER,But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
243775,L460259,u7225,m487,DR. WINTON,"Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth."
243776,L460258,u7226,m487,MOTHER,She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
243777,L460257,u7225,m487,DR. WINTON,"Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?"
243778,L460562,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her."
243779,L460561,u7228,m487,WASKI,Mother... is Rose going to die?
243780,L459789,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll."
243781,L459788,u7228,m487,WASKI,"Oh, Mother, cut it out."
243782,L459787,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"When he was baby we called him ""Wa Wa,"" a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful."
243783,L459786,u7228,m487,WASKI,You can stop it right now.
243784,L459785,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that."
243785,L460610,u7227,m487,ROSE,"And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!"
243786,L460609,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose."
243787,L460608,u7227,m487,ROSE,"You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!"
243788,L460579,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks."
243789,L460578,u7227,m487,ROSE,I was offered that job as a waitress.
243790,L460577,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Don't worry, honey, you'll find something."
243791,L460498,u7227,m487,ROSE,I don't mind.
243792,L460497,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose, you don't have to."
243793,L460482,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address."
243794,L460481,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that."
243795,L460480,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure."
243796,L460475,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say."
243797,L460474,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him."
243798,L460440,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick."
243799,L460439,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast."
243800,L460387,u7227,m487,ROSE,"I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home."
243801,L460386,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation."
243802,L460385,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more."
243803,L460384,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do."
243804,L460383,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yeah, it's kinda nice."
243805,L460382,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear."
243806,L460323,u7227,m487,ROSE,What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
243807,L460322,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?"
243808,L460275,u7227,m487,ROSE,"Yes, ma'am."
243809,L460274,u7226,m487,MOTHER,"Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?"
243810,L460267,u7226,m487,MOTHER,It'll get better now.
243811,L460266,u7227,m487,ROSE,"No more dentists, no more dentists..."

244257,L466814,u7242,m489,BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous."
244258,L466813,u7249,m489,LUKE,But I have no sister.

244263,L466808,u7242,m489,BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"

244265,L466806,u7242,m489,BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.

244269,L466802,u7242,m489,BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
244270,L466801,u7249,m489,LUKE,There's still good in him.
244271,L466796,u7242,m489,BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view."
244272,L466795,u7249,m489,LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
244273,L466793,u7242,m489,BEN,Yoda will always be with you.

244314,L466866,u7249,m489,LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
244315,L466865,u7245,m489,HAN,I don't know.  Fly casual.
244316,L466864,u7245,m489,HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
244317,L466863,u7249,m489,LUKE,Vader's on that ship.
244318,L466850,u7249,m489,LUKE,All set.
244319,L466849,u7245,m489,HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?"
244320,L466845,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Yeah, she's comin' up."
244321,L466844,u7245,m489,HAN,You got her warmed?
244322,L466837,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie."
244323,L466836,u7245,m489,HAN,Luke.
244324,L466759,u7249,m489,LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
244325,L466758,u7245,m489,HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
244326,L466721,u7245,m489,HAN,Oh... great!
244327,L466720,u7249,m489,LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
244328,L466719,u7245,m489,HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient."
244329,L466718,u7249,m489,LUKE,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."
244330,L466717,u7245,m489,HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur."
244331,L466709,u7245,m489,HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
244332,L466708,u7249,m489,LUKE,The same as always.
244333,L466707,u7245,m489,HAN,How are we doing?
244334,L466706,u7249,m489,LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.
244335,L466705,u7245,m489,HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?"
244336,L466704,u7249,m489,LUKE,Are you all right?
244337,L466703,u7245,m489,HAN,Luke!
244338,L466702,u7249,m489,LUKE,Han!
244339,L467183,u7245,m489,HAN,"All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way."
244340,L467182,u7248,m489,LEIA,Yes.
244341,L467181,u7245,m489,HAN,"You love him, don't you?"
244342,L467180,u7248,m489,LEIA,He wasn't. I can feel it.
244343,L467179,u7245,m489,HAN,I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
244344,L467081,u7245,m489,HAN,Here's the terminal.
244345,L467080,u7248,m489,LEIA,The code's changed. We need Artoo!
244346,L467048,u7245,m489,HAN,"Charges!  Come on, come on!"
244347,L467047,u7248,m489,LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
244348,L467015,u7245,m489,HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this."
244349,L467014,u7248,m489,LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
244350,L466995,u7248,m489,LEIA,Hold me.
244351,L466994,u7245,m489,HAN,I'm sorry.
244352,L466993,u7245,m489,HAN,Ahhh...
244353,L466992,u7248,m489,LEIA,I...
244354,L466960,u7248,m489,LEIA,I don't know.
244355,L466959,u7245,m489,HAN,What's going on?
244356,L466877,u7245,m489,HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
244357,L466876,u7248,m489,LEIA,Shall we try and go around?
244358,L466862,u7245,m489,HAN,It'll work. It'll work.
244359,L466861,u7248,m489,LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
244360,L466848,u7245,m489,HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again."
244361,L466847,u7248,m489,LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?"
244362,L466756,u7248,m489,LEIA,That's all any of us can see.
244363,L466755,u7245,m489,HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
244364,L466675,u7248,m489,LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.
244365,L466674,u7245,m489,HAN,Leia!
244366,L466673,u7248,m489,LEIA,Someone who loves you.
244367,L466843,u7245,m489,HAN,"You, too."
244368,L466842,u7247,m489,LANDO,Good luck.
244369,L466840,u7247,m489,LANDO,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?"
244370,L466839,u7245,m489,HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
244371,L466820,u7247,m489,LANDO,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab."
244372,L466819,u7245,m489,HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
244373,L466761,u7247,m489,LANDO,"Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later."
244374,L466760,u7245,m489,HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando."
244375,L466746,u7247,m489,LANDO,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
244376,L466745,u7245,m489,HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
244377,L466744,u7247,m489,LANDO,"No, wait! I thought you were blind!"
244378,L466743,u7245,m489,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
244379,L466737,u7245,m489,HAN,I'm trying!
244380,L466736,u7247,m489,LANDO,Lower it!
244381,L466735,u7245,m489,HAN,"Lando, grab it!"
244382,L466733,u7245,m489,HAN,Lando!
244383,L466732,u7247,m489,LANDO,Han! Chewie?
244384,L467118,u7245,m489,HAN,Let's see.
244385,L467117,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?"
244386,L467106,u7245,m489,HAN,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing."
244387,L467105,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
244388,L467104,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!"
244389,L467103,u7245,m489,HAN,Come on! Come on!
244390,L467102,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,We're coming!
244391,L466945,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
244392,L466944,u7245,m489,HAN,What did he say?
244393,L466940,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
244394,L466939,u7245,m489,HAN,Proper?!
244395,L466938,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper."
244396,L466937,u7245,m489,HAN,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
244397,L466936,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god."
244398,L466935,u7245,m489,HAN,What are you telling them?
244399,L466852,u7245,m489,HAN,"All right, hang on."
244400,L466851,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,Here we go again.
244401,L466715,u7245,m489,HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?"
244402,L466714,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
244403,L466713,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc."
244404,L466712,u7245,m489,HAN,"Good, I hate long waits."
244405,L466711,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately."
244406,L466619,u7252,m489,VADER,"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
244407,L466618,u7246,m489,JERJERROD,We shall double our efforts.
244408,L466617,u7252,m489,VADER,"That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress."
244409,L466616,u7252,m489,VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
244410,L466615,u7246,m489,JERJERROD,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
244411,L466614,u7252,m489,VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
244412,L466613,u7246,m489,JERJERROD,"I tell you, this station will be operational as planned."
244413,L466612,u7252,m489,VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
244414,L466611,u7246,m489,JERJERROD,"I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can."
244415,L466610,u7252,m489,VADER,"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule."
244416,L466609,u7246,m489,JERJERROD,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence."
244417,L467176,u7253,m489,WEDGE,"Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out."
244418,L467175,u7247,m489,LANDO,"All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower."
244419,L467174,u7253,m489,WEDGE,There it is!
244420,L467160,u7253,m489,WEDGE,Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
244421,L467159,u7247,m489,LANDO,Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
244422,L467158,u7247,m489,LANDO,Here goes nothing.
244423,L467157,u7253,m489,WEDGE,I'm going in.
244424,L467137,u7247,m489,LANDO,"Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down."
244425,L467136,u7253,m489,WEDGE,"Good shot, Red Two."
244426,L467052,u7253,m489,WEDGE,Red Leader standing by.
244427,L467051,u7247,m489,LANDO,All wings report in.
244428,L467028,u7248,m489,LEIA,"Oh, no."
244429,L467027,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
244430,L467026,u7248,m489,LEIA,Quiet.
244431,L467025,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
244432,L467017,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
244433,L467016,u7248,m489,LEIA,What's he saying?
244434,L466947,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,Your Royal Highness.
244435,L466946,u7248,m489,LEIA,Oh!
244436,L466682,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch."
244437,L466681,u7248,m489,LEIA,Ugh!
244438,L466988,u7249,m489,LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
244439,L466987,u7248,m489,LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?"
244440,L466986,u7249,m489,LUKE,"No, you don't. You've always been strong."
244441,L466985,u7248,m489,LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you."
244442,L466984,u7249,m489,LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.
244443,L466983,u7248,m489,LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.
244444,L466982,u7249,m489,LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.
244445,L466981,u7249,m489,LUKE,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it."
244446,L466980,u7248,m489,LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."
244447,L466979,u7249,m489,LUKE,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance."
244448,L466978,u7248,m489,LEIA,Your father?
244449,L466977,u7249,m489,LUKE,He's my father.
244450,L466974,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Vader is here...now, on this moon."
244451,L466973,u7248,m489,LEIA,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?"
244452,L466972,u7249,m489,LUKE,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
244453,L466971,u7248,m489,LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?"
244454,L466970,u7249,m489,LUKE,Tell me.
244455,L466969,u7248,m489,LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings."
244456,L466968,u7249,m489,LUKE,What do you remember?
244457,L466967,u7248,m489,LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
244458,L466966,u7249,m489,LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
244459,L466882,u7249,m489,LUKE,"I see them. Wait, Leia!"
244460,L466881,u7248,m489,LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!
244461,L467146,u7249,m489,LUKE,Never-r-r!
244462,L467145,u7252,m489,VADER,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will."
244463,L467144,u7252,m489,VADER,"Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
244464,L467143,u7249,m489,LUKE,I will not fight you.
244465,L467142,u7252,m489,VADER,"You cannot hide forever, Luke."
244466,L467133,u7252,m489,VADER,"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny."
244467,L467132,u7249,m489,LUKE,"You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."
244468,L467131,u7252,m489,VADER,There is no conflict.
244469,L467130,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict."
244470,L467128,u7249,m489,LUKE,"I will not fight you, father."
244471,L467127,u7252,m489,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.
244472,L467012,u7252,m489,VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now."
244473,L467011,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate."
244474,L467010,u7252,m489,VADER,If that is your destiny.
244475,L467009,u7249,m489,LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
244476,L467008,u7252,m489,VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
244477,L467007,u7252,m489,VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
244478,L467006,u7249,m489,LUKE,Come with me.
244479,L467002,u7252,m489,VADER,"So, you have accepted the truth."
244480,L467001,u7249,m489,LUKE,"I know, father."
244481,L467000,u7252,m489,VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.
244482,L466790,u7254,m489,YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny."
244483,L466789,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Well, I'm sorry."
244484,L466788,u7249,m489,LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?
244485,L466787,u7254,m489,YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate..."
244486,L466786,u7249,m489,LUKE,Yes.
244487,L466785,u7254,m489,YODA,"Told you, did he?"
244488,L466784,u7254,m489,YODA,Your father he is.
244489,L466783,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Yoda, I must know."
244490,L466779,u7254,m489,YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
244491,L466778,u7249,m489,LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
244492,L466777,u7254,m489,YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
244493,L466776,u7249,m489,LUKE,"Master Yoda, you can't die."
244494,L466653,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,Disintegrated?
244495,L466652,u7250,m489,NINEDENINE,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
244496,L466651,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily..."
244497,L466650,u7250,m489,NINEDENINE,How many languages do you speak?
244498,L466649,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, yes."
244499,L466648,u7250,m489,NINEDENINE,Yes or no will do.
244500,L466647,u7251,m489,THREEPIO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
244501,L466646,u7250,m489,NINEDENINE,"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?"
244502,L468159,u7258,m490,FRANK,"You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools."
244503,L468158,u7255,m490,BRAD,It's as if we were glued to the spot.
244504,L468107,u7258,m490,FRANK,Rocky!
244505,L468106,u7255,m490,BRAD,Janet!
244506,L468094,u7258,m490,FRANK,Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
244507,L468093,u7255,m490,BRAD,He might be.  I don't know.
244508,L468092,u7258,m490,FRANK,"And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?"
244509,L468091,u7255,m490,BRAD,He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
244510,L468090,u7258,m490,FRANK,"I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me."
244511,L468089,u7255,m490,BRAD,I was telling the truth.
244512,L468088,u7255,m490,BRAD,"I told you, my car broke down."
244513,L468087,u7258,m490,FRANK,I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
244514,L468040,u7258,m490,FRANK,On my mother's grave.
244515,L468039,u7255,m490,BRAD,You promise you won't tell?
244516,L468038,u7258,m490,FRANK,"Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure."
244517,L468037,u7255,m490,BRAD,Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
244518,L468036,u7258,m490,FRANK,Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
244519,L468035,u7255,m490,BRAD,Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
244520,L468034,u7258,m490,FRANK,"I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual."
244521,L468033,u7255,m490,BRAD,You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
244522,L468032,u7258,m490,FRANK,Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
244523,L468031,u7255,m490,BRAD,Why you - what have you done with Janet?
244524,L468030,u7258,m490,FRANK,"I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?"
244525,L468029,u7255,m490,BRAD,You!
244526,L467941,u7258,m490,FRANK,Oh well.  How about you.
244527,L467940,u7255,m490,BRAD,Certainly not!
244528,L467939,u7258,m490,FRANK,Do you have any tattoos Brad.
244529,L467807,u7257,m490,FAMILY,Janet
244530,L467806,u7255,m490,BRAD,"Made me give you the eye And then panic,"
244531,L467805,u7257,m490,FAMILY,Janet.
244532,L467788,u7255,m490,BRAD,"I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you."
244533,L467787,u7257,m490,FAMILY,Janet.
244534,L467786,u7255,m490,BRAD,So please don't tell me to can it.
244535,L467785,u7257,m490,FAMILY,Janet.
244536,L467784,u7255,m490,BRAD,The future is ours so let's plan it.
244537,L468051,u7260,m490,JANET,If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
244538,L468050,u7255,m490,BRAD,And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
244539,L468049,u7260,m490,JANET,"I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?"
244540,L468048,u7255,m490,BRAD,So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
244541,L468047,u7260,m490,JANET,I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
244542,L468046,u7255,m490,BRAD,And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
244543,L468045,u7260,m490,JANET,"I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses."
244544,L468028,u7260,m490,JANET,I hope so my darling.
244545,L468027,u7255,m490,BRAD,Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
244546,L468026,u7260,m490,JANET,Maybe we could try it this way.
244547,L468009,u7260,m490,JANET,Oh don't be so shy.
244548,L468008,u7255,m490,BRAD,"No, don't do that."
244549,L468007,u7260,m490,JANET,"Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light."
244550,L468006,u7255,m490,BRAD,It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
244551,L468005,u7260,m490,JANET,"Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if..."
244552,L467951,u7255,m490,BRAD,It's alright Janet.
244553,L467950,u7260,m490,JANET,Brad...
244554,L467936,u7255,m490,BRAD,Weiss.
244555,L467935,u7260,m490,JANET,Weiss.
244556,L467934,u7255,m490,BRAD,"I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice."
244557,L467924,u7255,m490,BRAD,"It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right."
244558,L467923,u7260,m490,JANET,Oh Brad.
244559,L467911,u7255,m490,BRAD,We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
244560,L467910,u7260,m490,JANET,Right!
244561,L467903,u7255,m490,BRAD,"I'm here, there's nothing to worry about."
244562,L467902,u7260,m490,JANET,"Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared."
244563,L467901,u7255,m490,BRAD,They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
244564,L467900,u7260,m490,JANET,This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
244565,L467899,u7255,m490,BRAD,Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
244566,L467898,u7260,m490,JANET,Then ask the butler - or someone.
244567,L467897,u7255,m490,BRAD,We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
244568,L467896,u7260,m490,JANET,Well I want to leave.
244569,L467895,u7255,m490,BRAD,It's just a..a party Janet.
244570,L467894,u7260,m490,JANET,But it seems so unhealthy here.
244571,L467893,u7255,m490,BRAD,For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
244572,L467892,u7260,m490,JANET,"Brad, please lets get out of here."
244573,L467891,u7255,m490,BRAD,Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
244574,L467890,u7260,m490,JANET,Oh....Say something.
244575,L467862,u7255,m490,BRAD,"Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos."
244576,L467861,u7260,m490,JANET,"Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?"
244577,L467857,u7255,m490,BRAD,Yes.
244578,L467856,u7260,m490,JANET,"Yes, the rain has been very heavy."
244579,L467852,u7255,m490,BRAD,"Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone."
244580,L467851,u7260,m490,JANET,"Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened."
244581,L467829,u7260,m490,JANET,"I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back."
244582,L467828,u7255,m490,BRAD,There's no point both of us getting wet.
244583,L467827,u7260,m490,JANET,I'm coming with you.
244584,L467826,u7255,m490,BRAD,Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
244585,L467825,u7260,m490,JANET,But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
244586,L467824,u7255,m490,BRAD,You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
244587,L467823,u7260,m490,JANET,Oh...
244588,L467822,u7255,m490,BRAD,We must have a blow-out.
244589,L467821,u7260,m490,JANET,What was that bang?
244590,L467820,u7255,m490,BRAD,"Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back."
244591,L467819,u7260,m490,JANET,Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
244592,L467818,u7255,m490,BRAD,I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
244593,L467816,u7255,m490,BRAD,"Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type."
244594,L467815,u7260,m490,JANET,Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
244595,L467810,u7255,m490,BRAD,"Dammit, Janet."
244596,L467809,u7260,m490,JANET,"Oh Brad, I'm mad."
244597,L467801,u7260,m490,JANET,For you.
244598,L467800,u7255,m490,BRAD,Oh Janet
244599,L467782,u7260,m490,JANET,Oh Brad.
244600,L467781,u7255,m490,BRAD,I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
244601,L467780,u7260,m490,JANET,Uh huh.
244602,L467779,u7255,m490,BRAD,I've got something to say.
244603,L467778,u7260,m490,JANET,Yes Brad.
244604,L467777,u7260,m490,JANET,Yes.
244605,L467776,u7255,m490,BRAD,And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
244606,L467775,u7260,m490,JANET,Yes.
244607,L467774,u7255,m490,BRAD,Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
244608,L467773,u7260,m490,JANET,Yes.
244609,L468220,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,Yes.
244610,L468219,u7255,m490,BRAD,Good God.
244611,L468086,u7255,m490,BRAD,I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
244612,L468085,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,You know this earth - this person.
244613,L468084,u7255,m490,BRAD,Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
244614,L467855,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,You're wet.
244615,L467854,u7255,m490,BRAD,"Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?"
244616,L467853,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,Hello.
244617,L468229,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
244618,L468228,u7256,m490,DR SCOTT,"Yes, well perhaps it was for the best."
244619,L468227,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
244620,L468226,u7256,m490,DR SCOTT,You're OK by me.
244621,L468225,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,A decision had to be made.
244622,L468224,u7256,m490,DR SCOTT,You did right.
244623,L468214,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,"Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter."
244624,L468213,u7256,m490,DR SCOTT,"Great Heavens, that's a laser."

244632,L468018,u7260,m490,JANET,Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
244633,L468017,u7258,m490,FRANK,Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
244634,L468015,u7258,m490,FRANK,"I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual."
244635,L468014,u7260,m490,JANET,You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
244636,L468013,u7258,m490,FRANK,"Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?"
244637,L468012,u7260,m490,JANET,"You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?"

244680,L467864,u7260,m490,JANET,Are you - giving a party?
244681,L467860,u7260,m490,JANET,You're too kind.
244682,L467859,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,I think you had better both come inside.
244683,L468233,u7261,m490,MAGENTA,And our World will do the Time Warp again.
244684,L468232,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
244685,L468231,u7261,m490,MAGENTA,Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
244686,L468230,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,"Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our ""androgenous"" planet."
244687,L468223,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
244688,L468222,u7261,m490,MAGENTA,I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
244689,L468076,u7261,m490,MAGENTA,Creature of the night.
244690,L468075,u7262,m490,RIFF RAFF,Creature of the night.
244691,L470649,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood..."
244692,L470648,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Don't say that.
244693,L470647,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --"
244694,L470646,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard."
244695,L470645,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...I dunno.
244696,L470644,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,What're we going to do?
244697,L470643,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
244698,L470642,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Yeah, I can't beat him."
244699,L470641,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Apollo?
244700,L470640,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...I can't beat him.
244701,L470639,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...What?
244702,L470638,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...Can't do it.
244703,L470635,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I gotta go out for a while.
244704,L470634,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Is everything all right?
244705,L470633,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
244706,L470632,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,What did you say about a pet shop?
244707,L470631,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...What?
244708,L470630,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,What was that you said about a pet shop?
244709,L470626,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Yeah...
244710,L470625,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to."
244711,L470605,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...Yes --
244712,L470604,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Wanna hear a dirty joke?
244713,L470572,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
244714,L470571,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...Are you going to say anything to him?
244715,L470570,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
244716,L470569,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
244717,L470568,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
244718,L470567,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...And he called the reporters --
244719,L470548,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know."
244720,L470547,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I thought it might be cute.
244721,L470546,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know."
244722,L470545,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,-- The legs.
244723,L470544,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Can't fool around -- You look very great.
244724,L470543,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Don't want weak legs.
244725,L470542,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak."
244726,L470541,u7283,m491,ROCKY,No... Sharp -- You look great.
244727,L470540,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
244728,L470539,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Sharp -- Real nice.
244729,L470538,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Like?
244730,L470537,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?"
244731,L470536,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Don't you open them anymore?
244732,L470390,u7283,m491,ROCKY,It did.
244733,L470389,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Yes.
244734,L470388,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
244735,L470387,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I'll be waiting.
244736,L470386,u7283,m491,ROCKY,'Bout seven.
244737,L470385,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
244738,L470384,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Ya puttin' me on, right?"
244739,L470383,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
244740,L470382,u7283,m491,ROCKY,How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
244741,L470299,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Don't tease me.
244742,L470298,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I always knew you was pretty.
244743,L470297,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Could ya take off that hat.
244744,L470296,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...What?
244745,L470295,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Do me another favor?
244746,L470294,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...T-thank you.
244747,L470293,u7283,m491,ROCKY,The glasses... Please.
244748,L470292,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,What?
244749,L470291,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Would ya take off your glasses?
244750,L470290,u7283,m491,ROCKY,But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
244751,L470289,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I should leave.
244752,L470288,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Yo, I'm not comfortable either."
244753,L470287,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
244754,L470286,u7283,m491,ROCKY,They're all the same.
244755,L470285,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
244756,L470284,u7283,m491,ROCKY,It's all right -- You're my guest.
244757,L470283,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"No, I don't belong here."
244758,L470282,u7283,m491,ROCKY,It's okay.
244759,L470281,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I don't think I belong here.
244760,L470280,u7283,m491,ROCKY,What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
244761,L470279,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,It's not that --
244762,L470278,u7283,m491,ROCKY,It's only temporary.
244763,L470277,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,It's fine.
244764,L470276,u7283,m491,ROCKY,What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
244765,L470274,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I'll call your brother.
244766,L470273,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I think he might be worried.
244767,L470272,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Why?
244768,L470271,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Yes.
244769,L470270,u7283,m491,ROCKY,You sure?
244770,L470269,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Yes, I do."
244771,L470268,u7283,m491,ROCKY,D'you really wanna call?
244772,L470267,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I wanna let my brother know where I am.
244773,L470266,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
244774,L470265,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Do you have a phone?
244775,L470264,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off."
244776,L470263,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I sold them to you.
244777,L470262,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
244778,L470261,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...No thanks.
244779,L470260,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Would ya like a glass of water?
244780,L470259,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,'Cause you can't sing or dance?
244781,L470258,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...Guess.
244782,L470257,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
244783,L470256,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare."
244784,L470255,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Morning after?
244785,L470254,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after."
244786,L470253,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I don't think you're a bum.
244787,L470252,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
244788,L470251,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
244789,L470250,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy."
244790,L470249,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,It doesn't bother me either.
244791,L470248,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me."
244792,L470247,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...I suppose.
244793,L470246,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I would say you're very shy by nature.
244794,L470245,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...I suppose.
244795,L470244,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Some people are very shy by nature.
244796,L470237,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'"
244797,L470236,u7283,m491,ROCKY,What's funny?
244798,L470233,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,By accident?
244799,L470232,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
244800,L470224,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Ohh!
244801,L470223,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I just dislocated my finger.
244802,L470221,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Absolutely.
244803,L470220,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
244804,L470217,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,And you never got the chance?
244805,L470216,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro."
244806,L470215,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...Aren't you skating?
244807,L470201,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
244808,L470200,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I think it's closed.
244809,L470199,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Looks quiet, y'know."
244810,L470198,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"To you, to me it's Thursday."
244811,L470197,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,It's Thanksgiving.
244812,L469991,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"...Goodnight, Rocky."
244813,L469990,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later."
244814,L469906,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Shell-shocked!
244815,L469905,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...I don't know.
244816,L469904,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
244817,L469901,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
244818,L469900,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...I'm sorry.
244819,L469899,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Me, I'm kinda aggravated."
244820,L469898,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...Fine.
244821,L469897,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...How's the turtle food this week?
244822,L470597,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!"
244823,L470596,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,What?!
244824,L470595,u7280,m491,PAULIE,You busted?!
244825,L470594,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me."
244826,L470593,u7280,m491,PAULIE,You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
244827,L470592,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Owe you what?
244828,L470591,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
244829,L470590,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Don't do that again!
244830,L470589,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!"
244831,L470588,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
244832,L470587,u7280,m491,PAULIE,You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
244833,L470586,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Only a pig would say that!
244834,L470585,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!"
244835,L470584,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...Paulie. Stop now!
244836,L470579,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Get outta my life both of ya's.
244837,L470578,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Don't talk like that to him!
244838,L470577,u7280,m491,PAULIE,You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
244839,L470576,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,It's not your house --
244840,L470575,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
244841,L470574,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Paulie!
244842,L470573,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
244843,L470380,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance."
244844,L470379,u7280,m491,PAULIE,That so.
244845,L470378,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
244846,L470362,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,You didn't!
244847,L470361,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Christ.
244848,L470360,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Oh, Rocky!"
244849,L470349,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,Paul.
244850,L470348,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out."
244851,L470185,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven."
244852,L470184,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Why?
244853,L470183,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,I can't go out.
244854,L470182,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
244855,L470181,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,...Like you?
244856,L470180,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life."
244857,L470179,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"Paulie, please --"
244858,L470178,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'."
244859,L470177,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,No... I can't!
244860,L470176,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out."
244861,L470175,u7264,m491,ADRIAN,"...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this."
244862,L470749,u7265,m491,APOLLO,...Thanks.
244863,L470748,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!"
244864,L470747,u7265,m491,APOLLO,...Stop jivin'!
244865,L470746,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight."
244866,L470745,u7265,m491,APOLLO,One more round.
244867,L470744,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor."
244868,L470736,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!"
244869,L470735,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"You're hurtin', man!"
244870,L470734,u7265,m491,APOLLO,No doctor!
244871,L470733,u7284,m491,TRAINER,Get that doctor.
244872,L470732,u7265,m491,APOLLO,My side.
244873,L470720,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!"
244874,L470719,u7265,m491,APOLLO,He got lucky.
244875,L470718,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play."
244876,L470717,u7265,m491,APOLLO,...That man's takin' his job too serious.
244877,L470703,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home."
244878,L470702,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight."
244879,L470701,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!"
244880,L470700,u7265,m491,APOLLO,I'll carry him 'till the third.
244881,L470699,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?"
244882,L470698,u7265,m491,APOLLO,...That boy damn near broke my arm.
244883,L470156,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!"
244884,L470155,u7284,m491,TRAINER,I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
244885,L470154,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit."
244886,L470153,u7284,m491,TRAINER,He won't last one round.
244887,L470145,u7265,m491,APOLLO,...I don't feel heat from the name.
244888,L470144,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy."
244889,L470116,u7265,m491,APOLLO,Give my main man a raise!!
244890,L470115,u7284,m491,TRAINER,"You's the novelty, Champ!"
244891,L470114,u7265,m491,APOLLO,I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
244892,L470152,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --"
244893,L470151,u7275,m491,JERGENS,Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
244894,L470150,u7265,m491,APOLLO,'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
244895,L470149,u7265,m491,APOLLO,...This man.
244896,L470148,u7275,m491,JERGENS,"Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?"
244897,L470147,u7265,m491,APOLLO,...Still don't feel no heat.
244898,L470146,u7275,m491,JERGENS,Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
244899,L470143,u7265,m491,APOLLO,How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
244900,L470142,u7275,m491,JERGENS,Fouls.
244901,L470141,u7265,m491,APOLLO,How 'bout this Billy Snow?
244902,L470119,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"No, man, it's very smart."
244903,L470118,u7275,m491,JERGENS,...It's very American.
244904,L470117,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!"
244905,L470111,u7275,m491,JERGENS,"Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this."
244906,L470110,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!"
244907,L470105,u7275,m491,JERGENS,Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
244908,L470104,u7265,m491,APOLLO,Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
244909,L470103,u7275,m491,JERGENS,"I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week."
244910,L470102,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!"
244911,L470095,u7275,m491,JERGENS,I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
244912,L470094,u7265,m491,APOLLO,Damn.
244913,L470031,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!"
244914,L470030,u7269,m491,COMMENTATOR,Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
244915,L470029,u7265,m491,APOLLO,Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
244916,L470028,u7269,m491,COMMENTATOR,Where're you off to now?
244917,L470027,u7265,m491,APOLLO,The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
244918,L470026,u7269,m491,COMMENTATOR,Still to be held in Philadelphia?
244919,L470025,u7265,m491,APOLLO,That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
244920,L470024,u7269,m491,COMMENTATOR,You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
244921,L470023,u7265,m491,APOLLO,"He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month."
244922,L470022,u7269,m491,COMMENTATOR,"Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?"
244923,L470021,u7265,m491,APOLLO,Very high an' very fast.
244924,L470020,u7269,m491,COMMENTATOR,"How was the flight, Champ?"
244925,L470136,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Move your shoulders down.
244926,L470135,u7266,m491,BODYGUARD,Kiss my ass.
244927,L470134,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Don't like yours neither.
244928,L470133,u7266,m491,BODYGUARD,I don't like ya face.
244929,L470130,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Does that bum have to say that?
244930,L470129,u7266,m491,BODYGUARD,Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
244931,L470128,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"She ain't retarded, she's shy."
244932,L470127,u7266,m491,BODYGUARD,Hear she's retarded.
244933,L469922,u7266,m491,BODYGUARD,...Of the truck that run over your face.
244934,L469921,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Of wa?
244935,L469920,u7266,m491,BODYGUARD,Did ya get the license number?
244936,L470066,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
244937,L470065,u7267,m491,CHIPPED TOOTH,"We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun."
244938,L470052,u7267,m491,CHIPPED TOOTH,"Buy us some Thunderbird, man."
244939,L470051,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...That's an old one.
244940,L470048,u7267,m491,CHIPPED TOOTH,"Hey, give Rocky a dime."
244941,L470047,u7283,m491,ROCKY,No dollar.
244942,L470046,u7267,m491,CHIPPED TOOTH,"'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar."
244943,L470045,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Why?
244944,L470044,u7267,m491,CHIPPED TOOTH,"Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar."
244945,L470043,u7283,m491,ROCKY,No wine.
244946,L470042,u7267,m491,CHIPPED TOOTH,"C'mon, man, it's cold, man."
244947,L470041,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
244948,L470040,u7267,m491,CHIPPED TOOTH,"Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man."
244949,L470242,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Charge it.
244950,L470241,u7268,m491,CLEANER,...How 'bout for the Cokes?
244951,L470240,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'"
244952,L470239,u7268,m491,CLEANER,That's ten bucks.
244953,L470235,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
244954,L470234,u7268,m491,CLEANER,Here -- Three minutes.
244955,L470230,u7283,m491,ROCKY,This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
244956,L470229,u7268,m491,CLEANER,Cost ya a buck.
244957,L470228,u7283,m491,ROCKY,How 'bout some Cokes?
244958,L470227,u7268,m491,CLEANER,Six!
244959,L470226,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?"
244960,L470225,u7268,m491,CLEANER,Seven minutes!
244961,L470219,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?"
244962,L470218,u7268,m491,CLEANER,Nine minutes!
244963,L470214,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"...Yeah, give 'er the Blades."
244964,L470213,u7268,m491,CLEANER,Ten minutes for ten dollars.
244965,L470212,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...Ten minutes.
244966,L470211,u7268,m491,CLEANER,Few minutes?
244967,L470210,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --"
244968,L470209,u7268,m491,CLEANER,This a con?
244969,L470208,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --"
244970,L470207,u7268,m491,CLEANER,"Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'."
244971,L470205,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out."
244972,L470204,u7268,m491,CLEANER,"Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here."
244973,L470203,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
244974,L470202,u7268,m491,CLEANER,"Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!"
244975,L470731,u7271,m491,COMMENTATOR #2,"Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest."
244976,L470730,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
244977,L470713,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
244978,L470712,u7271,m491,COMMENTATOR #2,There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
244979,L470711,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,"Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off."
244980,L470710,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
244981,L470709,u7271,m491,COMMENTATOR #2,"If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying."
244982,L470690,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,Creed is down!!!
244983,L470689,u7271,m491,COMMENTATOR #2,The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
244984,L470688,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,"The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men."
244985,L470666,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,I agree.
244986,L470665,u7271,m491,COMMENTATOR #2,It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
244987,L470664,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
244988,L470663,u7271,m491,COMMENTATOR #2,You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
244989,L470662,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,"I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'"
244990,L470661,u7271,m491,COMMENTATOR #2,"Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts."
244991,L470660,u7270,m491,COMMENTATOR #1,"We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels."
244992,L470529,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --"
244993,L470528,u7272,m491,DIPPER,"Yo' yellow, old man."
244994,L470524,u7272,m491,DIPPER,"Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here."
244995,L470523,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper."
244996,L470522,u7272,m491,DIPPER,Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
244997,L470521,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"You can forget about sparring, kid."
244998,L470518,u7272,m491,DIPPER,I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
244999,L470517,u7277,m491,MICKEY,What's happenin' here?
245000,L470516,u7272,m491,DIPPER,I say ya nothin'!
245001,L469888,u7273,m491,FATS,"Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours."
245002,L469887,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Ya still light seventy.
245003,L469886,u7273,m491,FATS,I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
245004,L469885,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...The juice is climbin' every week.
245005,L469884,u7273,m491,FATS,You have my food in ya hand.
245006,L469883,u7283,m491,ROCKY,What about for food an' stuff?
245007,L469882,u7273,m491,FATS,That's it.
245008,L469881,u7283,m491,ROCKY,That's it? -- Completely?
245009,L469880,u7273,m491,FATS,"That's it, I'm broke."
245010,L469879,u7283,m491,ROCKY,A hundred an' thirty.
245011,L469878,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved."
245012,L469877,u7273,m491,FATS,Bob.
245013,L469876,u7283,m491,ROCKY,What's ya name again?
245014,L469874,u7273,m491,FATS,"Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs."
245015,L469873,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.

245050,L469925,u7274,m491,GAZZO,It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.

245057,L470335,u7275,m491,JERGENS,"Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship."
245058,L470334,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man."
245059,L470333,u7275,m491,JERGENS,Did you hear what I said?
245060,L470332,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate."
245061,L470331,u7275,m491,JERGENS,"Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?"
245062,L470330,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
245063,L470329,u7275,m491,JERGENS,What?
245064,L470328,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?

245067,L470325,u7275,m491,JERGENS,Excuse me.

245079,L470086,u7276,m491,MARIE,"Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?"
245080,L470085,u7283,m491,ROCKY,What was I gonna say?
245081,L470084,u7276,m491,MARIE,I won't.

245083,L470081,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep."
245084,L470080,u7276,m491,MARIE,What?
245085,L470079,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it."
245086,L470078,u7276,m491,MARIE,"C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve."
245087,L470077,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore."
245088,L470076,u7276,m491,MARIE,Why?
245089,L470075,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'."
245090,L470074,u7276,m491,MARIE,Maybe I like garbage.
245091,L470073,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Makes your breath like garbage.

245096,L470068,u7276,m491,MARIE,I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
245097,L470067,u7283,m491,ROCKY,How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
245098,L470061,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
245099,L470060,u7276,m491,MARIE,"Stuff it, man!"

245140,L470451,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!"
245141,L470450,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance."
245142,L470449,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask."
245143,L470448,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none."
245144,L470447,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"Please, kid."

245147,L470444,u7283,m491,ROCKY,The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
245148,L470443,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager."
245149,L470442,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...Ya gave Dipper my locker.

But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923."
245158,L470431,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...What?
245159,L470430,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"Rocky, d'ya know what I done?"
245160,L470429,u7283,m491,ROCKY,How 'bout a glass of water?
245161,L470428,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that."
245162,L470427,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Fifty years, huh."
245163,L470425,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance."
245164,L470424,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Turtles -- domestic turtles.
245165,L470423,u7277,m491,MICKEY,Whatta' those?
245166,L470422,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Freak luck is a strange thing.
245167,L470421,u7277,m491,MICKEY,Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...

245188,L469981,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...No.
245189,L469980,u7277,m491,MICKEY,"Hey, ever think about retirin'?"

245295,L470171,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"Yeah, sure -- She's very excited."
245296,L470170,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
245297,L470168,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now."
245298,L470167,u7280,m491,PAULIE,I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
245299,L470166,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Gazzo's gotta come to you.
245300,L470165,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
245301,L470164,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Maybe another job is the best thing.
245302,L470163,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"I don't need a doctor, I need a different job."
245303,L470162,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Maybe ya should see a doctor.
245304,L470161,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
245305,L470160,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
245306,L470159,u7283,m491,ROCKY,What kinda business?
245307,L470158,u7280,m491,PAULIE,I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.

245313,L470014,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Let's get outta this stink.
245314,L470013,u7280,m491,PAULIE,I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.

245318,L470009,u7280,m491,PAULIE,She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
245319,L470008,u7280,m491,PAULIE,...Adrian ain't sharp.
245320,L470007,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Ya always in a bad mood --
245321,L470006,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Ya caught me in a bad mood.
245322,L470005,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Don't get mental, man."
245323,L470004,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor."
245324,L470003,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Hey --
245325,L470002,u7280,m491,PAULIE,My sister's a friggin' loser.

245327,L470000,u7280,m491,PAULIE,"Looks, huh?"
245328,L469999,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me."
245329,L469998,u7280,m491,PAULIE,Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
245330,L469997,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
245331,L469996,u7280,m491,PAULIE,What?
245332,L469995,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Yo, Paulie."

245334,L469993,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Yo, Paulie."

245336,L470509,u7281,m491,REPORTER,Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
245337,L470508,u7283,m491,ROCKY,I'll tear his head off.
245338,L470507,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Maybe --
245339,L470506,u7281,m491,REPORTER,Do you feel you have a chance?
245340,L470505,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Apollo's a great fighter.
245341,L470504,u7281,m491,REPORTER,We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
245342,L470502,u7281,m491,REPORTER,How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
245343,L470501,u7283,m491,ROCKY,...People talk to me more.
245344,L470500,u7281,m491,REPORTER,So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
245345,L470359,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!"
245346,L470358,u7282,m491,REPORTER #2,And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
245347,L470357,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
245348,L470356,u7282,m491,REPORTER #2,Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
245349,L470353,u7283,m491,ROCKY,"Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can."
245350,L470352,u7282,m491,REPORTER #2,How will you fight Apollo Creed?
245351,L470351,u7283,m491,ROCKY,Feel? I dunno... Happy.
245352,L470350,u7282,m491,REPORTER #2,This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
245353,L470995,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,"So what's your next move, Valiant?"
245354,L470994,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Well, I'll be..."
245355,L470993,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
245356,L470981,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
245357,L470980,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Oh, a ladies man, huh?"
245358,L470973,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Yeah...
245359,L470972,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,"You serve martinis, doncha?"
245360,L470971,u7288,m492,DOLORES,We don't serve formula. Snookums.
245361,L470992,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
245362,L470991,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
245363,L470988,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
245364,L470987,u7295,m492,VALIANT,So where is it then?
245365,L470986,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,"And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons."
245366,L470983,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,"C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?"
245367,L470982,u7295,m492,VALIANT,My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
245368,L470978,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,"You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy."
245369,L470977,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
245370,L470976,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,"Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed."
245371,L470975,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?"
245372,L470974,u7285,m492,BABY HERMAN,"Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman."
245373,L470863,u7286,m492,BETTY BOOP,"Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie."
245374,L470862,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Big on the musical comedy, huh?"
245375,L470861,u7286,m492,BETTY BOOP,He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
245376,L470860,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Shoulda guessed.
245377,L470859,u7286,m492,BETTY BOOP,"That's Marvin Acme, the gag king."
245378,L470858,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?"
245379,L470857,u7286,m492,BETTY BOOP,"Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'."
245380,L470856,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?"
245381,L470855,u7286,m492,BETTY BOOP,"Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown."
245382,L470788,u7287,m492,DIRECTOR,I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
245383,L470787,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
245384,L470786,u7287,m492,DIRECTOR,I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
245385,L470785,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time."
245386,L470783,u7287,m492,DIRECTOR,"That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!"
245387,L470782,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,A tweeting bird?
245388,L470781,u7287,m492,DIRECTOR,"What's this, Roger?"
245389,L471319,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie."
245390,L471318,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?"
245391,L471317,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
245392,L471316,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?"
245393,L471315,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Are you gonna call him, Eddie?"
245394,L471314,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I'll bet.
245395,L471313,u7288,m492,DOLORES,I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
245396,L471208,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Oh, no..."
245397,L471207,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Sounds like singin'.
245398,L471206,u7295,m492,VALIANT,What's that comin' from the bar?
245399,L471205,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs."
245400,L471204,u7295,m492,VALIANT,What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
245401,L471203,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
245402,L471202,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Maroon, right?"
245403,L471201,u7288,m492,DOLORES,I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
245404,L471200,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
245405,L471199,u7288,m492,DOLORES,The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
245406,L471198,u7295,m492,VALIANT,<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
245407,L471197,u7288,m492,DOLORES,What was <u>that</u>?
245408,L471083,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage."
245409,L471082,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?"
245410,L471079,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
245411,L471078,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
245412,L471073,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will."
245413,L471072,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"So what's the scam, Eddie?"
245414,L471066,u7295,m492,VALIANT,If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
245415,L471065,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Can you get him out of it, Eddie?"
245416,L471057,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
245417,L471056,u7288,m492,DOLORES,So you decided to help him after all?
245418,L471055,u7288,m492,DOLORES,It's all yours.
245419,L471054,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?"
245420,L471053,u7288,m492,DOLORES,He's a riot.
245421,L471048,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit."
245422,L471047,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?"
245423,L470998,u7295,m492,VALIANT,He's a Toon... who cares?
245424,L470997,u7288,m492,DOLORES,So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
245425,L470990,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?"
245426,L470989,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie."
245427,L470985,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Thanks for the vote of confidence.
245428,L470984,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages."
245429,L470969,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
245430,L470968,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Do you think the rabbit did it?
245431,L470962,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Bastards put him on notice.
245432,L470961,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?"
245433,L470960,u7288,m492,DOLORES,A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
245434,L470957,u7295,m492,VALIANT,What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
245435,L470956,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time."
245436,L470835,u7288,m492,DOLORES,R.K. Maroon.
245437,L470834,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Check the scrawl.
245438,L470833,u7288,m492,DOLORES,Is this paper even good?
245439,L470832,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
245440,L470831,u7288,m492,DOLORES,This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
245441,L470830,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
245442,L470829,u7288,m492,DOLORES,"So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!"
245443,L471487,u7289,m492,DOOM,"That's right, me."
245444,L471486,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You?
245445,L471483,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
245446,L471482,u7289,m492,DOOM,Surprised?
245447,L471481,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Holy shit, he's a Toon!"
245448,L471447,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline."
245449,L471446,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country."
245450,L471445,u7289,m492,DOOM,"A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another."
245451,L471444,u7295,m492,VALIANT,What the hell's a freeway?
245452,L471443,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways."
245453,L471441,u7289,m492,DOOM,They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
245454,L471440,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
245455,L471427,u7289,m492,DOOM,It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
245456,L471426,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?"
245457,L471425,u7289,m492,DOOM,"No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles."
245458,L471424,u7295,m492,VALIANT,So you're Cloverleaf?
245459,L471423,u7289,m492,DOOM,No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
245460,L471411,u7289,m492,DOOM,I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
245461,L471410,u7295,m492,VALIANT,The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
245462,L471409,u7289,m492,DOOM,"These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle."
245463,L471258,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch."
245464,L471257,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector."
245465,L471253,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that."
245466,L471252,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried."
245467,L471145,u7289,m492,DOOM,"You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station..."
245468,L471144,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
245469,L471143,u7289,m492,DOOM,Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
245470,L471142,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
245471,L471141,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town."
245472,L471140,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him."
245473,L471139,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown."
245474,L471138,u7295,m492,VALIANT,The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
245475,L471137,u7289,m492,DOOM,They?
245476,L471136,u7295,m492,VALIANT,They must've taken it off me.
245477,L471132,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall."
245478,L471131,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court."
245479,L471128,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Ask her...
245480,L471127,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?"
245481,L470933,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
245482,L470932,u7289,m492,DOOM,So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
245483,L470931,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
245484,L470930,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?"
245485,L470929,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
245486,L470925,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?"
245487,L470924,u7289,m492,DOOM,"Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?"
245488,L470923,u7295,m492,VALIANT,He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
245489,L471160,u7290,m492,EARL,"Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion."
245490,L471159,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Not much.  It's hard to talk.
245491,L471158,u7290,m492,EARL,Does it hurt?
245492,L471157,u7295,m492,VALIANT,No...
245493,L471156,u7290,m492,EARL,You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
245494,L471155,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"What am I, Earl?"
245495,L471154,u7290,m492,EARL,"Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo."
245496,L471153,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Toon cops worked me over.
245497,L471152,u7290,m492,EARL,"Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?"
245498,L471151,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Earl... it's me, Valiant."
245499,L471150,u7290,m492,EARL,Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
245500,L471406,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"Eddie, come on."
245501,L471405,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Hold on a second.
245502,L471397,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,He made me laugh.
245503,L471396,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?"
245504,L471395,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli..."
245505,L471394,u7295,m492,VALIANT,A joker to the end.
245506,L471393,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper."
245507,L471392,u7295,m492,VALIANT,So where is it?
245508,L471391,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
245509,L471390,u7295,m492,VALIANT,How did you get onto Doom?
245510,L471387,u7295,m492,VALIANT,He's right here in the...
245511,L471386,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,Where is he?
245512,L471385,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband."
245513,L471384,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,I didn't know who I could trust.
245514,L471383,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Why didn't you tell me?
245515,L471382,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?"
245516,L471379,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here."
245517,L471378,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong."
245518,L471377,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
245519,L471376,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You shot Roger.
245520,L471187,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?"
245521,L471186,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder."
245522,L471185,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
245523,L471184,u7295,m492,VALIANT,So altruistic.
245524,L471182,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?"
245525,L471181,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way."
245526,L471180,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do."
245527,L471179,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do."
245528,L471178,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home."
245529,L471177,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"No, no, no... I love my husband."
245530,L471176,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work."
245531,L471175,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
245532,L471174,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder."
245533,L471173,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,Toons aren't given imperfections.
245534,L471172,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?"
245535,L471170,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel."
245536,L471169,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"Oh... well, I... I just had to see you."
245537,L471168,u7295,m492,VALIANT,That's because I don't have a doorbell.
245538,L471167,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,"Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it."
245539,L471130,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will."
245540,L471129,u7291,m492,JESSICA RABBIT,Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
245541,L471493,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
245542,L471492,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Doom.
245543,L471491,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,What the hell is that?
245544,L470951,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,"That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution."
245545,L470950,u7295,m492,VALIANT,What's with the dip?
245546,L470940,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
245547,L470939,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
245548,L470910,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,Wait here...
245549,L470909,u7295,m492,VALIANT,What a gasser.
245550,L470908,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
245551,L470906,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
245552,L470905,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,Now what?
245553,L470903,u7295,m492,VALIANT,That's what you woke me up for?
245554,L470902,u7292,m492,LT. SANTINO,Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
245555,L471349,u7293,m492,MAROON,There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
245556,L471348,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Take it easy.
245557,L471347,u7293,m492,MAROON,"You tricked me, damn you!"
245558,L471346,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"No, I don't."
245559,L471345,u7293,m492,MAROON,"You got the will in there, don't ya?"
245560,L471343,u7293,m492,MAROON,"No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife."
245561,L471342,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Well, everybody needs a hobby."
245562,L471341,u7293,m492,MAROON,"No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer."
245563,L471340,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?"
245564,L471339,u7295,m492,VALIANT,That was the idea.
245565,L471338,u7293,m492,MAROON,Valiant!  You surprised me.
245566,L471324,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Stop what?
245567,L471323,u7293,m492,MAROON,Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
245568,L471322,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Maybe.  Why?
245569,L471321,u7293,m492,MAROON,Have you got the will?
245570,L471320,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
245571,L471099,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested."
245572,L471098,u7293,m492,MAROON,I've already seen your photographs.
245573,L471097,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
245574,L471096,u7293,m492,MAROON,Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
245575,L471095,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?"
245576,L470894,u7293,m492,MAROON,"Sure, Valiant, sure..."
245577,L470893,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee..."
245578,L470888,u7293,m492,MAROON,"Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years."
245579,L470887,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black."
245580,L470820,u7295,m492,VALIANT,As soon as is humanly possible.
245581,L470819,u7293,m492,MAROON,When will I hear from you?
245582,L470818,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Aren't you the lucky one...
245583,L470817,u7293,m492,MAROON,I got him on loan from Disney.
245584,L470813,u7295,m492,VALIANT,So's the job.
245585,L470812,u7293,m492,MAROON,A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
245586,L470811,u7295,m492,VALIANT,The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
245587,L470810,u7293,m492,MAROON,You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
245588,L470809,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I don't work in Toontown.
245589,L470808,u7293,m492,MAROON,Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
245590,L470807,u7295,m492,VALIANT,So what do you want me to do?
245591,L470806,u7293,m492,MAROON,"Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up."
245592,L470805,u7293,m492,MAROON,"Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny."
245593,L470804,u7295,m492,VALIANT,One too many safes dropped on his head?
245594,L470803,u7293,m492,MAROON,"Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?"
245595,L470802,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Only there's no business like it, no business I know."
245596,L470801,u7293,m492,MAROON,"How much do you know about show business, Valiant?"
245597,L470795,u7293,m492,MAROON,So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
245598,L470794,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?"
245599,L470793,u7293,m492,MAROON,"Valiant, did you see the rabbit?"
245600,L471518,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,From this box here...
245601,L471517,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
245602,L471516,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Only time will tell.
245603,L471515,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
245604,L471514,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back."
245605,L471512,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
245606,L471511,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"No, kid, you're a real hero."
245607,L471508,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters..."
245608,L471507,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Keep reading...
245609,L471505,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Good idea.
245610,L471504,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I think you oughta read it to her.
245611,L471503,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Yeah?
245612,L471502,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?"
245613,L471498,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Yeah...
245614,L471497,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
245615,L471496,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know."
245616,L471456,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
245617,L471455,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over."
245618,L471369,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk."
245619,L471368,u7295,m492,VALIANT,What the hell are you doin' in there?
245620,L471335,u7295,m492,VALIANT,... I'd head for Cucamonga.
245621,L471334,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Yeah?
245622,L471333,u7295,m492,VALIANT,If I don't make it back here by ten...
245623,L471332,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I rest my case.
245624,L471331,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Two bits.
245625,L471330,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?"
245626,L471329,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think."
245627,L471328,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Forget it.
245628,L471327,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"I tell you what, maybe I better come with you."
245629,L471326,u7295,m492,VALIANT,That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
245630,L471325,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock."
245631,L471311,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"No, it's not."
245632,L471310,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Wrong number?
245633,L471309,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Get away from there.
245634,L471308,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,I'll get it.
245635,L471307,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again."
245636,L471306,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Safe?
245637,L471305,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally."
245638,L471304,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board."
245639,L471303,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother."
245640,L471302,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,A Toon?  Noooo.
245641,L471301,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother."
245642,L471300,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?"
245643,L471299,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
245644,L471296,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"What is this, Twenty Questions?"
245645,L471295,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?"
245646,L471294,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Me.
245647,L471293,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Say, who's this guy laughin'?"
245648,L471291,u7295,m492,VALIANT,We can't do anything till it's dark.
245649,L471290,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?"
245650,L471289,u7295,m492,VALIANT,My brother.  Get inside.
245651,L471288,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
245652,L471264,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?"
245653,L471263,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter..."
245654,L471261,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Drink it, jerk.  All of it."
245655,L471260,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"But, Eddie, you know what happens when..."
245656,L471259,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me."
245657,L471256,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?"
245658,L471255,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding."
245659,L471254,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?"
245660,L471225,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal."
245661,L471224,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!"
245662,L471223,u7295,m492,VALIANT,I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
245663,L471222,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life."
245664,L471221,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Just because you got 'em to laugh?
245665,L471220,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
245666,L471219,u7295,m492,VALIANT,An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
245667,L471218,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum..."
245668,L471217,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!"
245669,L471216,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh."
245670,L471215,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'."
245671,L471214,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Hey, don't I get an encore?"
245672,L471081,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?"
245673,L471080,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?"
245674,L471077,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body."
245675,L471076,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,How do you know that?
245676,L471075,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
245677,L471074,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,The habeus corpus is thickening.
245678,L471071,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them."
245679,L471070,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
245680,L471069,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body."
245681,L471064,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
245682,L471063,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead."
245683,L471062,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?"
245684,L471061,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny."
245685,L471060,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
245686,L471059,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Yeah, that's better."
245687,L471058,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Does this help?
245688,L471039,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Don't ever forget that.
245689,L471038,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon."
245690,L471037,u7295,m492,VALIANT,Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
245691,L471034,u7295,m492,VALIANT,You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
245692,L471033,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
245693,L471019,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,"Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run."
245694,L471018,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"If you're so innocent, why'd you run?"
245695,L471017,u7294,m492,ROGER RABBIT,Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
245696,L471016,u7295,m492,VALIANT,"Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police."

Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness!

No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie.

I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady?

Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant."

245847,L472522,u7302,m493,GLORIA,"Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need."
245848,L472521,u7303,m493,JULIET,"No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business."
245849,L472520,u7302,m493,GLORIA,"What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?"
245850,L472497,u7303,m493,JULIET,"O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse."
245851,L472496,u7302,m493,GLORIA,"Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee."
245852,L472495,u7303,m493,JULIET,"O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies."
245853,L472483,u7302,m493,GLORIA,"Here comes your father, tell him so yourself."
245854,L472482,u7303,m493,JULIET,"What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!"
245855,L472481,u7302,m493,GLORIA,"Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride."
245856,L472480,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Madam, in happy time what day is that?"
245857,L472479,u7302,m493,GLORIA,"Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for."
245858,L472459,u7302,m493,GLORIA,She'll not come down tonight.
245859,L472458,u7303,m493,JULIET,"O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace."
245860,L472503,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved."
245861,L472502,u7306,m493,NURSE,What?
245862,L472501,u7303,m493,JULIET,Amen
245863,L472500,u7306,m493,NURSE,And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
245864,L472499,u7303,m493,JULIET,Speakest thou from thy heart?
245865,L472498,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him."
245866,L472394,u7306,m493,NURSE,Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
245867,L472393,u7303,m493,JULIET,I have.
245868,L472392,u7306,m493,NURSE,Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
245869,L472391,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?"
245870,L472390,u7306,m493,NURSE,O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
245871,L472389,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'"
245872,L472388,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?"
245873,L472387,u7303,m493,JULIET,"I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?"
245874,L472386,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back."
245875,L472385,u7303,m493,JULIET,But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
245876,L472384,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,"
245877,L472383,u7303,m493,JULIET,"How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;"
245878,L472382,u7306,m493,NURSE,What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
245879,L472381,u7303,m493,JULIET,"I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak."
245880,L472380,u7306,m493,NURSE,"I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!"
245881,L472379,u7303,m493,JULIET,"O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?"
245882,L472316,u7303,m493,JULIET,"By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send."
245883,L472315,u7306,m493,NURSE,[Within] Juliet!
245884,L472314,u7303,m493,JULIET,"I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--"
245885,L472313,u7306,m493,NURSE,[Within] Juliet!
245886,L472312,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
245887,L472311,u7306,m493,NURSE,Juliet!
245888,L472217,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Madam, I am here. What is your will?"
245889,L472216,u7306,m493,NURSE,I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
245890,L472551,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
245891,L472550,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm."
245892,L472478,u7303,m493,JULIET,"O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back."
245893,L472477,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu."
245894,L472476,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?"
245895,L472473,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes."
245896,L472472,u7303,m493,JULIET,"It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows."
245897,L472471,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day."
245898,L472470,u7303,m493,JULIET,"That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone."
245899,L472469,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
245900,L472468,u7303,m493,JULIET,Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
245901,L472428,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
245902,L472427,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them."
245903,L472322,u7303,m493,JULIET,I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
245904,L472321,u7307,m493,ROMEO,By the hour of nine.
245905,L472320,u7303,m493,JULIET,Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
245906,L472319,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks."
245907,L472318,u7303,m493,JULIET,"A thousand times good night! Exit, above"
245908,L472317,u7307,m493,ROMEO,So thrive my soul--
245909,L472310,u7303,m493,JULIET,I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
245910,L472309,u7307,m493,ROMEO,The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
245911,L472308,u7303,m493,JULIET,What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
245912,L472307,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
245913,L472306,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night."
245914,L472305,u7307,m493,ROMEO,If my heart's dear love--
245915,L472304,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee."
245916,L472303,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Well what shall I swear by?
245917,L472302,u7303,m493,JULIET,"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."
245918,L472301,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--"
245919,L472300,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:"
245920,L472299,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love."
245921,L472298,u7303,m493,JULIET,"If they do see thee, they will murder thee."
245922,L472297,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me."
245923,L472296,u7303,m493,JULIET,"How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here."
245924,L472295,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike."
245925,L472294,u7303,m493,JULIET,Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
245926,L472293,u7303,m493,JULIET,Ahhh!
245927,L472292,u7307,m493,ROMEO,I take thee at thy word.
245928,L472291,u7303,m493,JULIET,"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself."
245929,L472290,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"
245930,L472289,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet."
245931,L472288,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!"
245932,L472287,u7303,m493,JULIET,Ay me!
245933,L472286,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!"
245934,L472276,u7303,m493,JULIET,You kiss by the book.
245935,L472275,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
245936,L472274,u7303,m493,JULIET,Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
245937,L472273,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged."
245938,L472272,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake."
245939,L472271,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
245940,L472270,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
245941,L472269,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
245942,L472268,u7303,m493,JULIET,"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss."
245943,L472267,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss."
245944,L472266,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night."
245945,L472230,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days."
245946,L472229,u7304,m493,LADY CAPULET,"Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!"
245947,L472226,u7304,m493,LADY CAPULET,"Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?"
245948,L472225,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Nay, bigger; women grow by men."
245949,L472224,u7304,m493,LADY CAPULET,"This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less."
245950,L472223,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower."
245951,L472222,u7304,m493,LADY CAPULET,Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
245952,L472221,u7306,m493,NURSE,"A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax."
245953,L472220,u7304,m493,LADY CAPULET,"By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love."
245954,L472219,u7306,m493,NURSE,Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
245955,L472218,u7304,m493,LADY CAPULET,"Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age."
245956,L472426,u7307,m493,ROMEO,NO! Mercutio!
245957,L472425,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,A Plague o' both your houses.
245958,L472424,u7307,m493,ROMEO,I thought all for the best.
245959,L472423,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
245960,L472422,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Courage man, the hurt can not be much."
245961,L472421,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA."
245962,L472376,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,"
245963,L472375,u7307,m493,ROMEO,I will follow you.
245964,L472372,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Here's goodly gear!
245965,L472371,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature."
245966,L472370,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Why, then is my pump well flowered."
245967,L472369,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,Right.
245968,L472368,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Pink for flower.
245969,L472367,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy."
245970,L472366,u7307,m493,ROMEO,A most courteous exposition.
245971,L472365,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,Thou hast most kindly hit it.
245972,L472364,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Meaning, to court'sy."
245973,L472363,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams."
245974,L472362,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy."
245975,L472361,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?"
245976,L472360,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
245977,L472359,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night."
245978,L472358,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Ho Ho, Capital Punks!"
245979,L472281,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest."
245980,L472280,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Away, begone; the sport is at the best."
245981,L472248,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south."
245982,L472247,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing."
245983,L472246,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!"
245984,L472245,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"In bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
245985,L472244,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,That dreamers often lie.
245986,L472243,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Well, what was yours?"
245987,L472242,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,And so did I.
245988,L472241,u7307,m493,ROMEO,I dream'd a dream to-night.
245989,L472240,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Why, may one ask?"
245990,L472237,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down."
245991,L472236,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn."
245992,L472235,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,Too great oppression for a tender thing.
245993,L472234,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
245994,L472233,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound."
245995,L472232,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead"
245996,L472231,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance."
245997,L472418,u7309,m493,TYBALT,I am for you.
245998,L472417,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives."
245999,L472416,u7309,m493,TYBALT,What wouldst thou have with me?
246000,L472415,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?"
246001,L472407,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!"
246002,L472406,u7309,m493,TYBALT,Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
246003,L472405,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,Could you not take some occasion without giving?
246004,L472404,u7309,m493,TYBALT,"You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion."
246005,L472403,u7305,m493,MERCUTIO,"OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow."
246006,L472402,u7309,m493,TYBALT,"Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?"
246007,L472452,u7307,m493,ROMEO,"As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman."
246008,L472451,u7306,m493,NURSE,"O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again."
246009,L472450,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all"
246010,L472449,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Nurse.
246011,L472378,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
246012,L472377,u7306,m493,NURSE,"If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing."
246013,L472279,u7306,m493,NURSE,"His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy."
246014,L472278,u7307,m493,ROMEO,Is she a Capulet?
246015,L472277,u7306,m493,NURSE,"Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away."
246016,L472852,u7314,m494,GREGOR,As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
246017,L472851,u7310,m494,DAPPER GENT,What?
246018,L472850,u7314,m494,GREGOR,It's under your seat.
246019,L472848,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything..."
246020,L472847,u7310,m494,DAPPER GENT,Why did you do that?
246021,L472841,u7310,m494,DAPPER GENT,You know it is.
246022,L472840,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Do you really think so?
246023,L472839,u7310,m494,DAPPER GENT,This is important.
246024,L472838,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything."
246025,L472837,u7310,m494,DAPPER GENT,Do you have it?
246026,L473280,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I'm up for that...
246027,L473279,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing."
246028,L473278,u7323,m494,VINCENT,So where do you go from here?
246029,L473277,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more."
246030,L472815,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!"
246031,L472814,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground."
246032,L472813,u7323,m494,VINCENT,And I don't believe you...
246033,L472812,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Well I don't!
246034,L472811,u7323,m494,VINCENT,When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
246035,L472810,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,I don't know.
246036,L472809,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
246037,L472808,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Of course.
246038,L472789,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
246039,L472788,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned."
246040,L472780,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Leaving...
246041,L472779,u7323,m494,VINCENT,While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
246042,L472730,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Is that right?
246043,L472729,u7323,m494,VINCENT,We kept it...
246044,L472607,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Of course.
246045,L472606,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?"
246046,L472901,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness."
246047,L472900,u7316,m494,LARRY,"Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?"
246048,L472899,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss."
246049,L472898,u7316,m494,LARRY,"Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks."
246050,L472897,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Best beer in the world known to man or God.
246051,L472896,u7316,m494,LARRY,What is?
246052,L472895,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see."
246053,L472894,u7316,m494,LARRY,This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
246054,L472828,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,That's why you were riding with him.
246055,L472827,u7316,m494,LARRY,I never did trust that blonde fuck...
246056,L472824,u7316,m494,LARRY,How do we know that?
246057,L472823,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
246058,L472787,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,And then...
246059,L472786,u7316,m494,LARRY,Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
246060,L472774,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Which leads us to...
246061,L472773,u7316,m494,LARRY,"You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road."
246062,L472735,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
246063,L472734,u7316,m494,LARRY,So what's the deal?
246064,L472602,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,And who are you?
246065,L472601,u7316,m494,LARRY,I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
246066,L472593,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show."
246067,L472592,u7316,m494,LARRY,Who the fuck are you?
246068,L472591,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
246069,L473170,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time."
246070,L473169,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,Do I need to repeat myself?
246071,L473168,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,"Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?"
246072,L473167,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head..."
246073,L473166,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,"Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over."
246074,L473165,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix."
246075,L473151,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,They're good!
246076,L473150,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
246077,L473149,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Not yet...
246078,L473148,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,About time!
246079,L473142,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,You lose them!
246080,L473141,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,Lose them!
246081,L473126,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,That's him.
246082,L473125,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,From Interpol?
246083,L473124,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
246084,L473123,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,What in bloody hell is going on?
246085,L473033,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,Nothing.
246086,L473032,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
246087,L473031,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,"Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!"
246088,L472970,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,I thought I did.
246089,L472969,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Not to me, you know that."
246090,L472968,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,It's been known to happen.
246091,L472967,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?"
246092,L472966,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,"It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it."
246093,L472965,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?"
246094,L472964,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,Now there's the Deirdre I know.
246095,L472963,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself."
246096,L473282,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?"
246097,L473281,u7319,m494,SAM,Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
246098,L473250,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
246099,L473249,u7319,m494,SAM,Are you alright?
246100,L473116,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Bloody fucking hell...
246101,L473115,u7319,m494,SAM,I didn't say I was.
246102,L473114,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us."
246103,L473113,u7319,m494,SAM,Don't even think that I'm buying that.
246104,L473112,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,I'm a patriate.
246105,L473111,u7319,m494,SAM,Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
246106,L473110,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did."
246107,L472835,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
246108,L472834,u7319,m494,SAM,"Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think..."
246109,L472833,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes."
246110,L472826,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede..."
246111,L472825,u7319,m494,SAM,"Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us."
246112,L472820,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob."
246113,L472819,u7319,m494,SAM,"Now, what did we steal?"
246114,L472769,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Just business.
246115,L472768,u7319,m494,SAM,Duty calls?
246116,L472767,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,I better be getting that.
246117,L472766,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
246118,L472765,u7319,m494,SAM,"You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me."
246119,L472764,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  ""Send the girl to do it.""  ""Tell The girl to take care of it.""  ""Have the girl fuck him.""  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less."
246120,L472763,u7319,m494,SAM,"You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre."
246121,L472762,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again."
246122,L472745,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it..."
246123,L472744,u7319,m494,SAM,"And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now."
246124,L472743,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Nobody's saying they don't.
246125,L472742,u7319,m494,SAM,"Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you."
246126,L472741,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,That's right.
246127,L472740,u7319,m494,SAM,Is that right?
246128,L472739,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,I still am.
246129,L472738,u7319,m494,SAM,I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
246130,L472737,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
246131,L472733,u7319,m494,SAM,We weren't real thrilled about it either...
246132,L472732,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war..."
246133,L472731,u7319,m494,SAM,Hazard pay...
246134,L472600,u7319,m494,SAM,Once.
246135,L472599,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"You were a soldier, were you?"
246136,L472598,u7319,m494,SAM,Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
246137,L473246,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker."
246138,L473245,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Shut up!
246139,L473244,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Don't do it, Sam!"
246140,L473243,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away."
246141,L473207,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time."
246142,L473206,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,That fucking figures...
246143,L473030,u7314,m494,GREGOR,There's a problem...
246144,L473029,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Where's the case?
246145,L472791,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Ready when you are...
246146,L472790,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Alright, Gregor, I'm..."
246147,L472772,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,Next.
246148,L472771,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you."
246149,L472770,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?"
246150,L472630,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same."
246151,L472629,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"But would you stake your life, that's the question..."
246152,L472628,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I'd stake my reputation.
246153,L472627,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,You sure about this?
246154,L472626,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes..."
246155,L472625,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it."
246156,L472624,u7314,m494,GREGOR,It's quite satifactory.
246157,L472597,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs."
246158,L472596,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?"
246159,L472595,u7311,m494,DEIRDRE,"Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other."
246160,L472594,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Who are you?  IRA?
246161,L472919,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I think not.  After you...
246162,L472918,u7312,m494,EDVARD,Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
246163,L472917,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"You first, Edvard."
246164,L472916,u7312,m494,EDVARD,Do you have the material?
246165,L472915,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Really?  Do you have the money with you?
246166,L472914,u7312,m494,EDVARD,We'll double your price.
246167,L472913,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
246168,L472912,u7312,m494,EDVARD,"That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it."
246169,L472911,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice."
246170,L472910,u7312,m494,EDVARD,"Yes, Gregor, they sent me."
246171,L472713,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be."
246172,L472712,u7313,m494,FRANCOIS,In here...
246173,L472711,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Where's my information?
246174,L472710,u7313,m494,FRANCOIS,Of course.
246175,L472709,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I take it you still want the money...
246176,L472708,u7313,m494,FRANCOIS,"If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay."
246177,L472707,u7323,m494,VINCENT,What's that?
246178,L472706,u7313,m494,FRANCOIS,There's been a slight problem.
246179,L472705,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Here's yours.
246180,L472694,u7313,m494,FRANCOIS,"He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!"
246181,L472693,u7323,m494,VINCENT,What do you mean?
246182,L472692,u7313,m494,FRANCOIS,Bad company...
246183,L472691,u7323,m494,VINCENT,He's company.
246184,L472690,u7313,m494,FRANCOIS,Not so fast.  Who's that?
246185,L472689,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Do you have it?
246186,L473221,u7317,m494,MIKHI,You'll die if you leave here.
246187,L473220,u7314,m494,GREGOR,We'll die if we stay here!
246188,L473209,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
246189,L473208,u7317,m494,MIKHI,And more importantly --
246190,L473195,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Enough!
246191,L473194,u7317,m494,MIKHI,"I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him."
246192,L473193,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
246193,L473192,u7317,m494,MIKHI,"Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you."
246194,L473191,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely."
246195,L473190,u7317,m494,MIKHI,"Sit, sit...  Would you like one?"
246196,L473205,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off."
246197,L473204,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
246198,L473203,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"So, you've got it all figured, do you?"
246199,L473201,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,What's a little hate between business partners?
246200,L473200,u7314,m494,GREGOR,But you hate each other!
246201,L473199,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,"What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together."
246202,L473140,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,"You've told me a lot of things, boyo..."
246203,L473139,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"It is, I'm telling you it is!!"
246204,L473138,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
246205,L473036,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"I swear, it has to come here!  It has to..."
246206,L473035,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,"If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car."
246207,L472933,u7314,m494,GREGOR,A post office box.
246208,L472932,u7319,m494,SAM,Sent it where?
246209,L472931,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I sent it to myself in Paris.
246210,L472930,u7319,m494,SAM,Then where is it?
246211,L472929,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I swear...
246212,L472928,u7319,m494,SAM,Bullshit!
246213,L472927,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I don't have it with me...
246214,L472926,u7319,m494,SAM,"Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you."
246215,L472580,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Now that is an interesting proposition.
246216,L472579,u7319,m494,SAM,"So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people."
246217,L472578,u7319,m494,SAM,"I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money..."
246218,L472577,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Whoever hired us.
246219,L472862,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do."
246220,L472861,u7318,m494,PHONE VOICE,So what do we do?
246221,L472860,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
246222,L472859,u7318,m494,PHONE VOICE,"It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened."
246223,L472858,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"Much to your disappointment, no doubt."
246224,L472857,u7318,m494,PHONE VOICE,"Gregor, is that you?"
246225,L472856,u7314,m494,GREGOR,It's done.
246226,L472855,u7318,m494,PHONE VOICE,Is it done?
246227,L472759,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"I do, I do..."
246228,L472758,u7321,m494,SWEDE,I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
246229,L472757,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!"
246230,L472756,u7321,m494,SWEDE,Really?
246231,L472755,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Nobody's going to do that!
246232,L472754,u7321,m494,SWEDE,Don't cross me...
246233,L472753,u7314,m494,GREGOR,What are you doing?
246234,L472752,u7314,m494,GREGOR,What's that?
246235,L472751,u7321,m494,SWEDE,There is one other thing...
246236,L472750,u7314,m494,GREGOR,Then I guess we're set.
246237,L472749,u7321,m494,SWEDE,That's it.
246238,L472748,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"A means to an end, is that it?"
246239,L472747,u7321,m494,SWEDE,"I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it."
246240,L472746,u7314,m494,GREGOR,I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
246241,L472582,u7314,m494,GREGOR,"Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine."
246242,L472581,u7321,m494,SWEDE,How so?
246243,L473001,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
246244,L473000,u7323,m494,VINCENT,How did you know?
246245,L472999,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?"
246246,L472998,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Not exactly.
246247,L472997,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
246248,L472996,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Of course.  Don't you?
246249,L472995,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,And you respect him.
246250,L472994,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Yes, Sam's tough alright."
246251,L472993,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"He's tough, your American friend."
246252,L472975,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent."
246253,L472974,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Hello, Jean-Pierre."
246254,L473027,u7319,m494,SAM,"A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival."
246255,L473026,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,You seem one to me.
246256,L473025,u7319,m494,SAM,Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
246257,L473024,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
246258,L473023,u7319,m494,SAM,Created?
246259,L473022,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
246260,L473021,u7319,m494,SAM,So what is it you want to know?
246261,L473020,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you."
246262,L473019,u7319,m494,SAM,"If I was healthy, I could take that away from you."
246263,L473018,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,Call it a reckoning of character.
246264,L473017,u7319,m494,SAM,"So this is what, a test?"
246265,L473016,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop."
246266,L473015,u7319,m494,SAM,Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
246267,L473014,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law."
246268,L473013,u7319,m494,SAM,I didn't expect that he would.
246269,L473012,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"He sees this differently, as you well know."
246270,L473010,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you."
246271,L473009,u7319,m494,SAM,It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
246272,L473008,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
246273,L473007,u7319,m494,SAM,Yeah.
246274,L473006,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,But first you have something to take care of?
246275,L473005,u7319,m494,SAM,Soon.
246276,L473004,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,You should really let a doctor look at that.
246277,L473003,u7319,m494,SAM,"Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now."
246278,L472992,u7319,m494,SAM,Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
246279,L472991,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"Don't worry, we'll take care of it."
246280,L472990,u7319,m494,SAM,You think you can stitch me up on you own?
246281,L472980,u7319,m494,SAM,"No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it."
246282,L472979,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,Are you sure you won't have a drink?
246283,L472977,u7315,m494,JEAN-PIERRE,"Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?"
246284,L472976,u7319,m494,SAM,American.
246285,L472832,u7319,m494,SAM,Did he bring that with him?
246286,L472831,u7316,m494,LARRY,"What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?"
246287,L472807,u7316,m494,LARRY,"Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way..."
246288,L472806,u7319,m494,SAM,"It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future."
246289,L472622,u7319,m494,SAM,My way is better.
246290,L472621,u7316,m494,LARRY,"Yeah, well...  My way works too."
246291,L472620,u7316,m494,LARRY,"Why don't you go do better, then..."
246292,L472619,u7319,m494,SAM,It's been known to happen.
246293,L472618,u7316,m494,LARRY,Is that right?
246294,L472617,u7319,m494,SAM,Long enough to shoot back.
246295,L472616,u7316,m494,LARRY,Not for long.
246296,L472615,u7319,m494,SAM,"All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live."
246297,L472614,u7316,m494,LARRY,Gets the job done.
246298,L472613,u7319,m494,SAM,You shoot alright.
246299,L472590,u7316,m494,LARRY,Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
246300,L472589,u7319,m494,SAM,"The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness."
246301,L472802,u7316,m494,LARRY,I don't think so.
246302,L472801,u7321,m494,SWEDE,"I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy."
246303,L472796,u7316,m494,LARRY,Not in mine.
246304,L472795,u7321,m494,SWEDE,It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
246305,L472794,u7316,m494,LARRY,Is that right?
246306,L472793,u7321,m494,SWEDE,You should learn a little patience.
246307,L472792,u7316,m494,LARRY,Where is this broad?
246308,L472778,u7316,m494,LARRY,I blast the lead car into oblivion...
246309,L472777,u7321,m494,SWEDE,After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
246310,L472776,u7316,m494,LARRY,Eat shit and die slowly...
246311,L472775,u7321,m494,SWEDE,I ride with fat-boy...
246312,L472635,u7321,m494,SWEDE,"Who you calling dumb, dickless?"
246313,L472634,u7316,m494,LARRY,"And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?"
246314,L472633,u7321,m494,SWEDE,"I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds."
246315,L472632,u7316,m494,LARRY,Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
246316,L472631,u7321,m494,SWEDE,You should watch what you eat.
246317,L472610,u7321,m494,SWEDE,Everybody.
246318,L472609,u7316,m494,LARRY,Who's they?
246319,L472608,u7321,m494,SWEDE,They call me Swede.
246320,L472585,u7316,m494,LARRY,"I got a surprise for you, blondie..."
246321,L472584,u7321,m494,SWEDE,What a surprise...
246322,L472583,u7316,m494,LARRY,"What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand."
246323,L473276,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked."
246324,L473275,u7319,m494,SAM,"I told you, I quit."
246325,L473271,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I guess that's for the best.
246326,L473270,u7319,m494,SAM,Gone.  Destroyed.
246327,L473269,u7323,m494,VINCENT,What happened to it?
246328,L473268,u7319,m494,SAM,"I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon."
246329,L473267,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
246330,L473266,u7319,m494,SAM,"You better get some sleep, alright?"
246331,L473265,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I know.
246332,L473264,u7319,m494,SAM,"You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt."
246333,L473263,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"""Your field dressing saved his life."" That's three I owe you."
246334,L473262,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Nothing...
246335,L473261,u7319,m494,SAM,What of it?
246336,L473260,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You speak French.
246337,L473259,u7319,m494,SAM,What?
246338,L473258,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You son-of-a-bitch...
246339,L473237,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Finish it!
246340,L473236,u7319,m494,SAM,And now...
246341,L473235,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Finish the job...
246342,L473234,u7319,m494,SAM,Let's get him out of here...
246343,L473223,u7319,m494,SAM,I'll work on it...
246344,L473222,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You have to stop doing that!
246345,L473189,u7319,m494,SAM,"No, I don't."
246346,L473188,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Do you have a good answer?
246347,L473187,u7319,m494,SAM,That's a good question.
246348,L473186,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?"
246349,L473185,u7319,m494,SAM,"And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job."
246350,L473184,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Closest and oldest.
246351,L473183,u7319,m494,SAM,"It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?"
246352,L473182,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Why not?
246353,L473181,u7319,m494,SAM,Because I don't walk away.
246354,L473180,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for."
246355,L473179,u7319,m494,SAM,"The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job."
246356,L473178,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that."
246357,L473177,u7319,m494,SAM,Would you stop with that...
246358,L473176,u7323,m494,VINCENT,What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
246359,L473175,u7319,m494,SAM,Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
246360,L473174,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Just like that?
246361,L473173,u7319,m494,SAM,Time to quit.
246362,L473172,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing."
246363,L473171,u7319,m494,SAM,Not here.  They might see it.
246364,L473164,u7319,m494,SAM,Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
246365,L473163,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Do we need anything else?
246366,L473162,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I think not.
246367,L473161,u7319,m494,SAM,In a minute.
246368,L473160,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?"
246369,L473159,u7319,m494,SAM,"No you don't, and you know it."
246370,L473158,u7323,m494,VINCENT,So I do it.
246371,L473157,u7319,m494,SAM,"I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it."
246372,L473156,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Something like that.
246373,L473155,u7319,m494,SAM,Business keeps you on the road?
246374,L473154,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I'm not here very much.
246375,L473147,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?"
246376,L473146,u7319,m494,SAM,Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
246377,L473145,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Right now?
246378,L473144,u7319,m494,SAM,Give me a cigarette.
246379,L473122,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out."
246380,L473121,u7319,m494,SAM,I don't know...
246381,L473120,u7323,m494,VINCENT,What the fuck happened?
246382,L473107,u7319,m494,SAM,"You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him."
246383,L473106,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You think?
246384,L473105,u7319,m494,SAM,They don't have the package.
246385,L473102,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Because I owe you.  Look at that...
246386,L473101,u7319,m494,SAM,How could you have done that?
246387,L473100,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have."
246388,L473099,u7319,m494,SAM,You would have done that?
246389,L473098,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
246390,L473097,u7319,m494,SAM,You were behind the door?
246391,L473096,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
246392,L473095,u7319,m494,SAM,I never made that claim.
246393,L473094,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all."
246394,L473093,u7319,m494,SAM,It is at that.
246395,L473092,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Very ugly.
246396,L473091,u7319,m494,SAM,Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
246397,L473090,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Dark ops?
246398,L473089,u7319,m494,SAM,I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
246399,L473088,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer."
246400,L473087,u7319,m494,SAM,"Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said."
246401,L473086,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam."
246402,L473085,u7319,m494,SAM,It's my job.
246403,L473084,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
246404,L473083,u7319,m494,SAM,Do what?
246405,L473082,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?"
246406,L473081,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"If Tony says this is it, then it's it."
246407,L473080,u7319,m494,SAM,You sure your friend got the right place?
246408,L473079,u7319,m494,SAM,Thorough man.
246409,L473078,u7323,m494,VINCENT,The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
246410,L473077,u7319,m494,SAM,What's this?
246411,L473076,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Yes.
246412,L473075,u7319,m494,SAM,The Irish representative?
246413,L473069,u7319,m494,SAM,I know of him.
246414,L473068,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You know him?
246415,L472988,u7319,m494,SAM,"Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out."
246416,L472987,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Clearly.
246417,L472986,u7319,m494,SAM,You see the bullet?
246418,L472985,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Alright, it's done."
246419,L472962,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Yes I do.
246420,L472961,u7319,m494,SAM,You don't have to do this.
246421,L472960,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"It isn't about money for me, not anymore."
246422,L472959,u7319,m494,SAM,"This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this."
246423,L472958,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I'm going with you.
246424,L472957,u7319,m494,SAM,"We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me."
246425,L472956,u7323,m494,VINCENT,It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
246426,L472955,u7319,m494,SAM,"My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish."
246427,L472954,u7323,m494,VINCENT,And what job is that?
246428,L472953,u7319,m494,SAM,"If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do."
246429,L472952,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
246430,L472951,u7319,m494,SAM,Not exactly.
246431,L472950,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop."
246432,L472949,u7319,m494,SAM,No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
246433,L472948,u7323,m494,VINCENT,No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
246434,L472947,u7319,m494,SAM,You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
246435,L472946,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor."
246436,L472945,u7319,m494,SAM,"I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit."
246437,L472944,u7323,m494,VINCENT,That makes twice now you've saved my life.
246438,L472936,u7319,m494,SAM,But you can't.
246439,L472935,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
246440,L472889,u7319,m494,SAM,"It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there."
246441,L472888,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
246442,L472887,u7319,m494,SAM,He's going back.
246443,L472881,u7319,m494,SAM,"You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits."
246444,L472880,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun."
246445,L472879,u7319,m494,SAM,"We live in a singular world, my friend."
246446,L472878,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't."
246447,L472877,u7319,m494,SAM,You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
246448,L472876,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
246449,L472875,u7319,m494,SAM,I've seen a lot of people die before.
246450,L472874,u7323,m494,VINCENT,A lot of people died.
246451,L472873,u7319,m494,SAM,It was at that.
246452,L472871,u7319,m494,SAM,I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
246453,L472870,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
246454,L472869,u7319,m494,SAM,"I borrowed that, too..."
246455,L472868,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like."
246456,L472867,u7319,m494,SAM,I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
246457,L472866,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You were smoking?
246458,L472865,u7319,m494,SAM,I came up here to sneak a smoke.
246459,L472864,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you..."
246460,L472863,u7319,m494,SAM,What's going on?
246461,L472830,u7319,m494,SAM,Gregor's cell phone...
246462,L472829,u7323,m494,VINCENT,The question still remains: what do we do now?
246463,L472723,u7319,m494,SAM,Because that's what I would have done...
246464,L472722,u7323,m494,VINCENT,But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
246465,L472721,u7319,m494,SAM,"I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy."
246466,L472720,u7323,m494,VINCENT,That there was a gun pointed at me.
246467,L472719,u7319,m494,SAM,Know what?
246468,L472718,u7323,m494,VINCENT,How did you know?
246469,L472717,u7319,m494,SAM,Well I ain't a cop.
246470,L472716,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops..."
246471,L472715,u7319,m494,SAM,"You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit."
246472,L472703,u7319,m494,SAM,"You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent."
246473,L472702,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I needed to know.
246474,L472697,u7319,m494,SAM,See what?
246475,L472696,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I just wanted to see something.
246476,L472695,u7319,m494,SAM,What's going on?
246477,L472687,u7319,m494,SAM,"They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up."
246478,L472686,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Lovely, isn't it?"
246479,L472685,u7319,m494,SAM,Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
246480,L472684,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something."
246481,L472683,u7319,m494,SAM,"That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this."
246482,L472682,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around."
246483,L472681,u7319,m494,SAM,Who am I?
246484,L472680,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I wanted to see who you were.
246485,L472679,u7319,m494,SAM,"I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?"
246486,L472678,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
246487,L472677,u7319,m494,SAM,"Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous."
246488,L472676,u7323,m494,VINCENT,So is the woman.
246489,L472675,u7319,m494,SAM,"Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is."
246490,L472674,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this."
246491,L472673,u7319,m494,SAM,Exactly.  Why not bring them?
246492,L472672,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Like Larry or Swede.
246493,L472671,u7319,m494,SAM,"So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy."
246494,L472670,u7323,m494,VINCENT,There is that.
246495,L472669,u7319,m494,SAM,"It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side."
246496,L472668,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable."
246497,L472667,u7319,m494,SAM,I do.
246498,L472666,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?"
246499,L472665,u7319,m494,SAM,"I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week."
246500,L472664,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
246501,L472662,u7319,m494,SAM,One's a lot more painful than the other.
246502,L472661,u7323,m494,VINCENT,What's the difference?
246503,L472660,u7319,m494,SAM,"Not at all.  Similar, but not the same."
246504,L472659,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Same thing, isn't it?"
246505,L472658,u7319,m494,SAM,Jujitsu.
246506,L472657,u7323,m494,VINCENT,That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
246507,L472656,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I asked if we could give him anything else.
246508,L472655,u7319,m494,SAM,What'd you say to him?
246509,L472651,u7319,m494,SAM,I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
246510,L472650,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I didn't know that you spoke French.
246511,L472649,u7319,m494,SAM,"And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?"
246512,L472648,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Something like that...
246513,L472647,u7319,m494,SAM,"As in, they own it?"
246514,L472646,u7323,m494,VINCENT,He says this is their block.
246515,L472644,u7319,m494,SAM,That's what I thought.
246516,L472643,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Pretty much what you'd expect.
246517,L472640,u7319,m494,SAM,I can do that.
246518,L472639,u7323,m494,VINCENT,To see a man about a thing.
246519,L472638,u7319,m494,SAM,Where to?
246520,L472605,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Things.  This is my country, you know."
246521,L472604,u7319,m494,SAM,Coordinate what?
246522,L472603,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
246523,L472573,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Let's just say he knows who I am.
246524,L472572,u7319,m494,SAM,He trusts you to lock up?
246525,L472571,u7319,m494,SAM,No thanks.
246526,L472570,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Cigarette?
246527,L472569,u7319,m494,SAM,I know cops -- and you're no cop.
246528,L472568,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Perhaps the police?
246529,L472567,u7319,m494,SAM,Who else would you be?
246530,L472566,u7323,m494,VINCENT,What makes you think we're here to meet you?
246531,L472565,u7319,m494,SAM,Sorry I'm late...
246532,L473067,u7319,m494,SAM,Seamus Reilly.
246533,L473066,u7322,m494,TONY,"Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly."
246534,L473065,u7322,m494,TONY,Gonna be tough.
246535,L473064,u7319,m494,SAM,It's the Irish tape we want.
246536,L473063,u7322,m494,TONY,Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
246537,L473062,u7319,m494,SAM,Why's that?
246538,L473059,u7319,m494,SAM,I'm sure.
246539,L473058,u7322,m494,TONY,You sure?
246540,L473057,u7319,m494,SAM,Gaelic.
246541,L473050,u7322,m494,TONY,"It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners."
246542,L473049,u7319,m494,SAM,What's the story?
246543,L473135,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,You slept with the fucker!!
246544,L473134,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You put everything on the line because you...
246545,L473133,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
246546,L473132,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You slept with her!
246547,L473130,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
246548,L473129,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You slept with her!
246549,L473128,u7320,m494,SEAMUS,Why didn't you kill him?
246550,L473127,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Why didn't you kill her?
246551,L473074,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long."
246552,L473073,u7322,m494,TONY,"I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle."
246553,L473072,u7323,m494,VINCENT,"Tony and I have to talk some business, first."
246554,L473071,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I get the picture.
246555,L473070,u7322,m494,TONY,"Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying."
246556,L473061,u7322,m494,TONY,The Russian would be easier.
246557,L473060,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Can you get it?
246558,L473056,u7322,m494,TONY,All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
246559,L473055,u7323,m494,VINCENT,You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
246560,L473054,u7322,m494,TONY,"What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix."
246561,L473052,u7322,m494,TONY,I might know where you could get a copy.
246562,L473051,u7323,m494,VINCENT,Do you have the tape?
246563,L473048,u7322,m494,TONY,"Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool."
246564,L473047,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
246565,L473045,u7322,m494,TONY,Why don't we step into my office...
246566,L473044,u7323,m494,VINCENT,A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
246567,L473043,u7322,m494,TONY,Doing well.  This is?
246568,L473042,u7323,m494,VINCENT,I'm alright.  And you?
246569,L473041,u7322,m494,TONY,"My man, how you doing?"
246570,L476127,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Don't lie to me!!!!
246571,L476126,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I don't know what you're -
246572,L476125,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?"
246573,L476124,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Dwayne listen to me -
246574,L476123,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
246575,L475831,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I can't get enough of it.
246576,L475830,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
246577,L475485,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,I want to get some hounds down here.
246578,L475484,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Damn.
246579,L475473,u7324,m495,BOOTH,None of them had any --
246580,L475472,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
246581,L475464,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive."
246582,L475463,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,What the hell happened here?
246583,L475314,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
246584,L475313,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Sort of!

246586,L476164,u7328,m495,EARL,And you're solid on that?
246587,L476163,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Uh huh.
246588,L476162,u7328,m495,EARL,"That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that."
246589,L476158,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
246590,L476157,u7328,m495,EARL,Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
246591,L476156,u7324,m495,BOOTH,It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
246592,L476155,u7328,m495,EARL,"You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours."
246593,L476153,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
246594,L476152,u7328,m495,EARL,It's NOT too late!
246595,L476151,u7324,m495,BOOTH,It's too late...
246596,L476148,u7328,m495,EARL,"Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!"
246597,L476147,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What are you talking about?
246598,L476145,u7328,m495,EARL,"I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in."
246599,L476144,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Dwayne's dead.
246600,L476143,u7328,m495,EARL,What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
246601,L476142,u7324,m495,BOOTH,No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
246602,L476141,u7328,m495,EARL,We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
246603,L476140,u7324,m495,BOOTH,He killed her...
246604,L476139,u7328,m495,EARL,"Booth, listen to me...Booth!"
246605,L476138,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"He found us, he shot her...he killed her..."
246606,L476137,u7328,m495,EARL,What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
246607,L476136,u7324,m495,BOOTH,He killed her...he killed her...
246608,L476135,u7328,m495,EARL,Oh Jesus...
246609,L476100,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Then Sally comes too.
246610,L476099,u7328,m495,EARL,That's right.
246611,L476098,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We've got to go now, then."
246612,L476097,u7328,m495,EARL,"We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it."
246613,L476096,u7324,m495,BOOTH,We're not?  How do you figure that?
246614,L476095,u7328,m495,EARL,No we're not.
246615,L476094,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Then we're screwed.
246616,L476093,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
246617,L476092,u7324,m495,BOOTH,It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
246618,L476091,u7328,m495,EARL,"I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?"
246619,L476006,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
246620,L476005,u7328,m495,EARL,Do you have everything?
246621,L476004,u7328,m495,EARL,Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
246622,L476003,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Maybe we should say somethin'.
246623,L475999,u7328,m495,EARL,"Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives."
246624,L475998,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You don't know if he was really gonna --
246625,L475997,u7328,m495,EARL,"We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!"
246626,L475996,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
246627,L475989,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
246628,L475988,u7328,m495,EARL,It's gonna be o.k.
246629,L475987,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You killed him...
246630,L475986,u7328,m495,EARL,"Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!"
246631,L475980,u7328,m495,EARL,There it is...now what about the others?
246632,L475979,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Here it is.
246633,L475977,u7328,m495,EARL,I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
246634,L475976,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
246635,L475958,u7328,m495,EARL,"I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!"
246636,L475957,u7324,m495,BOOTH,How long is it going to take?!
246637,L475889,u7328,m495,EARL,Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
246638,L475888,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Not bad enough to kill him.
246639,L475887,u7328,m495,EARL,How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
246640,L475886,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You're crazy.
246641,L475884,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
246642,L475883,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Well what are we supposed to do?
246643,L475882,u7328,m495,EARL,"I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do."
246644,L475881,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape."
246645,L475880,u7328,m495,EARL,"If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!"
246646,L475879,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up..."
246647,L475878,u7328,m495,EARL,Neither do I.
246648,L475877,u7324,m495,BOOTH,No.
246649,L475876,u7328,m495,EARL,You think he's bluffing?
246650,L475870,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse."
246651,L475869,u7328,m495,EARL,You're out of your mind.
246652,L475718,u7328,m495,EARL,Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
246653,L475717,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You said that last time!
246654,L475716,u7328,m495,EARL,"For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down."
246655,L475715,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?"
246656,L475712,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not."
246657,L475711,u7328,m495,EARL,He's going to be trouble.
246658,L475710,u7328,m495,EARL,Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
246659,L475709,u7324,m495,BOOTH,He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
246660,L475708,u7328,m495,EARL,All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
246661,L475707,u7324,m495,BOOTH,And how do you figure we do that?
246662,L475706,u7328,m495,EARL,I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
246663,L475705,u7324,m495,BOOTH,...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
246664,L475704,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
246665,L475703,u7328,m495,EARL,Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
246666,L475702,u7324,m495,BOOTH,All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
246667,L475701,u7328,m495,EARL,I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
246668,L475629,u7328,m495,EARL,"Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner."
246669,L475628,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"He would have done it to us, right?"
246670,L475627,u7328,m495,EARL,"Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do."
246671,L475626,u7324,m495,BOOTH,That's not what I mean.
246672,L475625,u7328,m495,EARL,Okay then.  I'll do it.
246673,L475624,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I can't do that.
246674,L475623,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway."
246675,L475622,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
246676,L475621,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know...
246677,L475620,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What are you thinking?
246678,L475619,u7328,m495,EARL,Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
246679,L475616,u7324,m495,BOOTH,He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
246680,L475615,u7328,m495,EARL,"How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!"
246681,L475564,u7328,m495,EARL,Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
246682,L475563,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I should have known something like this was going to happen!
246683,L475562,u7328,m495,EARL,"It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is."
246684,L475561,u7324,m495,BOOTH,It's the right thing to do.
246685,L475560,u7328,m495,EARL,"Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way."
246686,L475559,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape."
246687,L475558,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape..."
246688,L475557,u7328,m495,EARL,No we didn't.  He died on his own.
246689,L475556,u7324,m495,BOOTH,We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
246690,L475555,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well, we didn't know that at the time."
246691,L475554,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us."
246692,L475553,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
246693,L475552,u7324,m495,BOOTH,This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
246694,L475551,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know...
246695,L475550,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!"
246696,L475495,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?"
246697,L475494,u7328,m495,EARL,"Fair enough, I'll take it to my place."
246698,L475493,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
246699,L475492,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own."
246700,L475491,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
246701,L475490,u7328,m495,EARL,I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
246702,L475451,u7328,m495,EARL,"Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do."
246703,L475450,u7324,m495,BOOTH,That's not what I mean.
246704,L475449,u7328,m495,EARL,Okay then.  I'll do it.
246705,L475448,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I...I can't do that.
246706,L475447,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway."
246707,L475446,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
246708,L475445,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know...
246709,L475444,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What are you thinking?
246710,L475443,u7328,m495,EARL,I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
246711,L475438,u7324,m495,BOOTH,He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
246712,L475437,u7328,m495,EARL,"How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!"
246713,L475436,u7324,m495,BOOTH,He saw everything!
246714,L475435,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
246715,L475430,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --"
246716,L475429,u7328,m495,EARL,What are you gonna do?
246717,L475428,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Shhh!
246718,L475414,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well, we won't do any of that shit!"
246719,L475413,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions."
246720,L475412,u7328,m495,EARL,What's that?
246721,L475411,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I've got one condition.
246722,L475408,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I don't know.
246723,L475407,u7328,m495,EARL,"We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight."
246724,L475406,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Torch it?!
246725,L475405,u7328,m495,EARL,"We'll torch the bases, how's that?"
246726,L475403,u7328,m495,EARL,All right we will.
246727,L475402,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
246728,L475401,u7328,m495,EARL,Maybe.  Who cares?
246729,L475400,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?"
246730,L475398,u7328,m495,EARL,"They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?"
246731,L475397,u7324,m495,BOOTH,At the expense of six people.
246732,L475396,u7328,m495,EARL,That's right!
246733,L475395,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
246734,L475394,u7328,m495,EARL,"It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true."
246735,L475393,u7328,m495,EARL,Because...I know.
246736,L475392,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What makes you so sure?
246737,L475391,u7328,m495,EARL,"I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!"
246738,L475390,u7324,m495,BOOTH,It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
246739,L475389,u7328,m495,EARL,Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
246740,L475388,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
246741,L475387,u7328,m495,EARL,"We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!"
246742,L475385,u7328,m495,EARL,We'll figure something out.
246743,L475384,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!"
246744,L475383,u7328,m495,EARL,Why?
246745,L475382,u7324,m495,BOOTH,It won't work.
246746,L475381,u7328,m495,EARL,"Hell, it won't be us!"
246747,L475380,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Well someone's gonna find them.
246748,L475379,u7328,m495,EARL,Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
246749,L475378,u7324,m495,BOOTH,We don't know that.
246750,L475377,u7328,m495,EARL,"Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!"
246751,L475376,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?"
246752,L475375,u7328,m495,EARL,Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
246753,L475374,u7324,m495,BOOTH,No.  We can't.
246754,L475373,u7328,m495,EARL,Why?  Are you kidding me?
246755,L475372,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Call it in I guess.  Why?
246756,L475370,u7328,m495,EARL,I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
246757,L475369,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What do you mean what are we going to do?
246758,L475368,u7328,m495,EARL,What are we going to do?
246759,L475364,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Shit, more than that."
246760,L475363,u7328,m495,EARL,There must be over a million dollars in here.
246761,L475362,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Ten thousand right here.
246762,L475357,u7328,m495,EARL,They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
246763,L475356,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What the hell...
246764,L475351,u7328,m495,EARL,"That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate."
246765,L475350,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
246766,L475349,u7328,m495,EARL,"Oh, you would have done great."
246767,L475348,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Never heard of it.
246768,L475347,u7328,m495,EARL,"Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two..."
246769,L475346,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Cash and what?
246770,L475345,u7328,m495,EARL,He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
246771,L475344,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Seven thousand...
246772,L475343,u7328,m495,EARL,"Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all."
246773,L475342,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I hear you.
246774,L475341,u7328,m495,EARL,"I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble."
246775,L475340,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
246776,L475339,u7328,m495,EARL,"Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise."
246777,L475338,u7324,m495,BOOTH,The horniest dog in Nevada.
246778,L475337,u7328,m495,EARL,"How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?"
246779,L475326,u7328,m495,EARL,I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
246780,L475325,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Don't spend it all in one place.
246781,L475324,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Sure thing, and --"
246782,L475323,u7328,m495,EARL,"Ready to roll, partner?"
246783,L475975,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"What are you doing, Earl?"
246784,L475974,u7330,m495,JESSE,OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
246785,L475973,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Whoa, Earl!"
246786,L475963,u7330,m495,JESSE,HELLLLLP!!!!
246787,L475962,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Shut up, Jesse."
246788,L475961,u7330,m495,JESSE,You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
246789,L475960,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!"
246790,L475959,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!"
246791,L475952,u7330,m495,JESSE,You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
246792,L475951,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You don't expect us to believe that do you?
246793,L475933,u7324,m495,BOOTH,No.  It's not.
246794,L475932,u7330,m495,JESSE,I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
246795,L475862,u7330,m495,JESSE,I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
246796,L475861,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Just take it in stride.
246797,L475860,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem."
246798,L475859,u7324,m495,BOOTH,None of us like it!
246799,L475858,u7330,m495,JESSE,"I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!"
246800,L475853,u7330,m495,JESSE,I want my share. All of it.
246801,L475852,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What are you proposing?
246802,L475851,u7330,m495,JESSE,There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
246803,L475675,u7330,m495,JESSE,By Friday.
246804,L475674,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Two thousand...
246805,L475673,u7330,m495,JESSE,"I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?"
246806,L475672,u7324,m495,BOOTH,How much?
246807,L475671,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak."
246808,L475670,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins."
246809,L475669,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Well, I don't know..."
246810,L475668,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down."
246811,L475667,u7330,m495,JESSE,I'm all ears.
246812,L475666,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition."
246813,L475665,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me."
246814,L475659,u7330,m495,JESSE,"My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is..."
246815,L475658,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"What's your offer, Jesse?"
246816,L475657,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!"
246817,L475654,u7330,m495,JESSE,"My point, well..."
246818,L475653,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Why don't you get to the point.
246819,L475652,u7330,m495,JESSE,You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
246820,L475813,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation."
246821,L475812,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Yeah?  So?
246822,L475542,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Denning was wearing a bug.
246823,L475541,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What's that?
246824,L475540,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next."
246825,L475537,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks."
246826,L475536,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You mean that guy was an agent?
246827,L475535,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago."
246828,L475532,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
246829,L475531,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Could it have been in the Mercedes?
246830,L475527,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Because someone may have gotten away.
246831,L475526,u7324,m495,BOOTH,No.  Why?
246832,L475525,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?"

246838,L476106,u7333,m495,SALLY,I don't believe it.
246839,L476105,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Things just got a little screwed up, that's all."
246840,L476103,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.

246843,L476086,u7333,m495,SALLY,"Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden..."
246844,L476085,u7324,m495,BOOTH,We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
246845,L476084,u7333,m495,SALLY,I don't know.  My friends...
246846,L476083,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?"
246847,L476082,u7333,m495,SALLY,"I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else..."
246848,L476081,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Why does that bother you?
246849,L476069,u7324,m495,BOOTH,It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
246850,L476068,u7333,m495,SALLY,Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
246851,L476067,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
246852,L476066,u7333,m495,SALLY,When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
246853,L476065,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
246854,L476064,u7333,m495,SALLY,"I don't know, Booth."
246855,L476063,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
246856,L476062,u7333,m495,SALLY,How are we going to do all this?
246857,L475747,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Well I was just throwing out ideas...
246858,L475746,u7333,m495,SALLY,A satellite dish?
246859,L475743,u7333,m495,SALLY,I love you.
246860,L475742,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I love you Sally.
246861,L475741,u7333,m495,SALLY,So do I.
246862,L475737,u7333,m495,SALLY,It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
246863,L475736,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside..."
246864,L475735,u7333,m495,SALLY,I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
246865,L475734,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish..."
246866,L475731,u7333,m495,SALLY,"I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer."
246867,L475730,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?"
246868,L475729,u7333,m495,SALLY,"He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year."
246869,L475728,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you."
246870,L475727,u7333,m495,SALLY,I know.
246871,L475726,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Dammit, I'm so sick of this."
246872,L475725,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all."
246873,L475724,u7333,m495,SALLY,"It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal."
246874,L475723,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Great...
246875,L475722,u7333,m495,SALLY,"He started digging through my closet, something he never does."
246876,L475721,u7324,m495,BOOTH,How the hell did he find it?
246877,L475720,u7333,m495,SALLY,"I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it."
246878,L475611,u7333,m495,SALLY,"Well, I can't let you down now, can I?"
246879,L475610,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You're worth every last penny.
246880,L475605,u7324,m495,BOOTH,There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
246881,L475604,u7333,m495,SALLY,And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
246882,L475603,u7324,m495,BOOTH,And I'd take it out on him.
246883,L475602,u7333,m495,SALLY,"Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me."
246884,L475601,u7333,m495,SALLY,Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
246885,L475600,u7324,m495,BOOTH,That son of a bitch.
246886,L475599,u7333,m495,SALLY,"He's not, he's..."
246887,L475598,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
246888,L475597,u7333,m495,SALLY,Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
246889,L475596,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Nothing happened?
246890,L475595,u7324,m495,BOOTH,What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
246891,L475593,u7324,m495,BOOTH,You deserve it is the occasion.
246892,L475592,u7333,m495,SALLY,You got me something?  What's the occasion?
246893,L475591,u7333,m495,SALLY,I'm in here.
246894,L475590,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
246895,L475515,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I love you too.
246896,L475514,u7333,m495,SALLY,OK.  I love you.
246897,L475513,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
246898,L475512,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Yeah I'm fine.
246899,L475511,u7333,m495,SALLY,Are you sure you're OK?
246900,L475510,u7324,m495,BOOTH,OK.
246901,L475509,u7333,m495,SALLY,Oh.  You coming by tonight?
246902,L475508,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Nothing's wrong.
246903,L475507,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Nothing.
246904,L475506,u7333,m495,SALLY,What's wrong?
246905,L475505,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I know.
246906,L475504,u7333,m495,SALLY,"It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official."
246907,L475503,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Yeah.
246908,L475502,u7333,m495,SALLY,Heard you had quite a night.
246909,L475501,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Hi.
246910,L475500,u7333,m495,SALLY,Hi.
246911,L475289,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I might have to look into that...
246912,L475288,u7333,m495,SALLY,Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
246913,L475286,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"No.  But he would, probably."
246914,L475285,u7333,m495,SALLY,Has he?
246915,L475284,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Ah hell, he'd do the same for me."
246916,L475283,u7333,m495,SALLY,He's irresponsible.
246917,L475282,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car."
246918,L475280,u7324,m495,BOOTH,Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
246919,L475279,u7333,m495,SALLY,There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
246920,L475278,u7324,m495,BOOTH,"I gotta take some money out, that's what for."
246921,L475277,u7333,m495,SALLY,What for?
246922,L475276,u7324,m495,BOOTH,I have to go to the bank before it closes.
246923,L476051,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Thanks for your time.
246924,L476050,u7325,m495,CLERK,"A week ago, at most."
246925,L476049,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Be more specific.  A month, a week..."
246926,L476045,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Could it have been this?
246927,L476044,u7325,m495,CLERK,I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
246928,L476043,u7331,m495,MARTIN,What did he buy?
246929,L476042,u7325,m495,CLERK,"Yeah, I've seen him."
246930,L475271,u7335,m495,WILLIE,"First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son."
246931,L475270,u7326,m495,CLIFF,What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
246932,L475267,u7335,m495,WILLIE,Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
246933,L475266,u7326,m495,CLIFF,What?
246934,L475265,u7335,m495,WILLIE,How about you give us what you have and leave.
246935,L475264,u7326,m495,CLIFF,And what's that?
246936,L475263,u7335,m495,WILLIE,I have a better plan.
246937,L475262,u7326,m495,CLIFF,What?
246938,L475261,u7335,m495,WILLIE,I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
246939,L475257,u7326,m495,CLIFF,"You said that, I didn't."
246940,L475256,u7335,m495,WILLIE,You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
246941,L475255,u7326,m495,CLIFF,"Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?"
246942,L475251,u7335,m495,WILLIE,Sounds like you don't trust me.
246943,L475250,u7326,m495,CLIFF,Yeah.
246944,L475249,u7335,m495,WILLIE,Test the product?
246945,L475828,u7328,m495,EARL,"Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up."
246946,L475827,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,What do you think about all this?
246947,L475569,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,This just might be our ticket!
246948,L475568,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't know.
246949,L475529,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity."
246950,L475528,u7328,m495,EARL,What makes you say that?
246951,L475487,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction."
246952,L475486,u7328,m495,EARL,Why?
246953,L475320,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that."
246954,L475319,u7328,m495,EARL,Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
246955,L475318,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf."
246956,L475905,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Did you say After Midnight?
246957,L475904,u7331,m495,MARTIN,OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
246958,L475901,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
246959,L475900,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
246960,L475899,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Dwayne.
246961,L475898,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Sheriff Hogan --
246962,L475897,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here."
246963,L475896,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
246964,L475895,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Have you known this all along?
246965,L475894,u7331,m495,MARTIN,We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
246966,L475842,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Mm-hmm...
246967,L475841,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all."
246968,L475840,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Don't you have to be here?
246969,L475839,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Maybe I should come along.
246970,L475838,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
246971,L475819,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously."
246972,L475818,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Why would someone do that?
246973,L475817,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it."
246974,L475816,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,What are you getting at?
246975,L475815,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Maybe.  Maybe not.
246976,L475810,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Don't you think I would have told you that!
246977,L475809,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"Uh, no..."
246978,L475579,u7331,m495,MARTIN,We appreciate that.
246979,L475578,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers."
246980,L475575,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --"
246981,L475574,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
246982,L475546,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Excellent. I'll go down with you.
246983,L475545,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
246984,L475544,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
246985,L475543,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back."
246986,L475521,u7331,m495,MARTIN,I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
246987,L475520,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,I guess we can get started.
246988,L475911,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
246989,L475910,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?"
246990,L475909,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Lingerie...
246991,L475908,u7334,m495,WALLACE,Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
246992,L475907,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?"
246993,L475906,u7334,m495,WALLACE,Yeah.
246994,L475893,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
246995,L475892,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills."
246996,L475891,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Is this marked money, or what?"
246997,L475890,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them."
246998,L476041,u7332,m495,SALESPERSON,"Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you."
246999,L476040,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,A lot of men come in here?
247000,L476039,u7332,m495,SALESPERSON,"Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here."
247001,L476038,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
247002,L476037,u7332,m495,SALESPERSON,Sure.
247003,L476036,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not."
247004,L476035,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
247005,L476034,u7332,m495,SALESPERSON,Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
247006,L476033,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Yeah I'd say C...C.
247007,L476032,u7332,m495,SALESPERSON,C?

247036,L475759,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Uh, sure.  I hear you."
247037,L475758,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can."
247038,L475757,u7330,m495,JESSE,About what?
247039,L475756,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us."
247040,L475755,u7330,m495,JESSE,Why?
247041,L475754,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?

247045,L475316,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws."
247046,L475315,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,She's not his type.
247047,L475312,u7330,m495,JESSE,Sort of.
247048,L475311,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?"
247049,L475304,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Take it or leave it.
247050,L475303,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!"
247051,L475302,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
247052,L475301,u7330,m495,JESSE,"No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man."

247055,L475297,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play."
247056,L475296,u7330,m495,JESSE,Damn its hot in here...
247057,L475295,u7330,m495,JESSE,"I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look."
247058,L475294,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Just goes to show you.
247059,L476129,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Calm down --
247060,L476128,u7333,m495,SALLY,Dwayne please calm down!
247061,L476119,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,You'd do this to me!
247062,L476118,u7333,m495,SALLY,Dwayne -
247063,L476117,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,You'd do this to me?!
247064,L476116,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
247065,L476115,u7333,m495,SALLY,Dwayne put the gun down --
247066,L476114,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
247067,L475930,u7333,m495,SALLY,It certainly is...
247068,L475929,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring."
247069,L475928,u7333,m495,SALLY,"No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!"
247070,L475927,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?"
247071,L475926,u7333,m495,SALLY,Whatever...
247072,L475923,u7333,m495,SALLY,"Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner."
247073,L475922,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Yeah let's hear about your day.
247074,L475921,u7333,m495,SALLY,Don't you want to hear about my day?
247075,L475920,u7333,m495,SALLY,Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
247076,L475919,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
247077,L475918,u7333,m495,SALLY,I didn't say that.  You did.
247078,L475917,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
247079,L475915,u7333,m495,SALLY,That hasn't stopped you before.
247080,L475914,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
247081,L475913,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
247082,L475700,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Watch that.  Watch that tone.
247083,L475699,u7333,m495,SALLY,I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
247084,L475698,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,What are you saying?
247085,L475696,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,"A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!"
247086,L475695,u7333,m495,SALLY,It was going to be a surprise!
247087,L475688,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Forget it.
247088,L475687,u7333,m495,SALLY,I can't hear a word you're saying!
247089,L475686,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
247090,L475685,u7333,m495,SALLY,What?
247091,L475684,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,Hey where's the hot pad?
247092,L475679,u7333,m495,SALLY,I don't know...
247093,L475678,u7327,m495,DWAYNE,What's this?
247094,L475969,u7330,m495,JESSE,Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
247095,L475968,u7328,m495,EARL,"Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot."
247096,L475967,u7328,m495,EARL,"We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are."
247097,L475966,u7330,m495,JESSE,Don't hurt me.
247098,L475945,u7330,m495,JESSE,Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
247099,L475944,u7328,m495,EARL,I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
247100,L475943,u7328,m495,EARL,We're gonna talk.
247101,L475942,u7330,m495,JESSE,"What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --"
247102,L475873,u7330,m495,JESSE,I think I am.
247103,L475872,u7328,m495,EARL,You're never getting that much.
247104,L475871,u7330,m495,JESSE,You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
247105,L475867,u7328,m495,EARL,Well you can't have it.
247106,L475866,u7330,m495,JESSE,So I want the money and I want it now.
247107,L475865,u7328,m495,EARL,Oh Jesus Christ...
247108,L475864,u7330,m495,JESSE,I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
247109,L475863,u7328,m495,EARL,What do you mean?  You gambled it?
247110,L475857,u7330,m495,JESSE,Listen -
247111,L475856,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well you're not getting, either."
247112,L475855,u7330,m495,JESSE,I'm not asking.
247113,L475850,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Just do it!  Meet me there, now."
247114,L475849,u7328,m495,EARL,What?
247115,L475848,u7330,m495,JESSE,Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
247116,L475836,u7330,m495,JESSE,Right behind you.
247117,L475835,u7328,m495,EARL,We're out of here.
247118,L475664,u7330,m495,JESSE,"True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?"
247119,L475663,u7328,m495,EARL,"And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?"
247120,L475662,u7330,m495,JESSE,I'll settle for a third of that.
247121,L475656,u7328,m495,EARL,Then what the hell are you all about?
247122,L475655,u7330,m495,JESSE,"Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about."
247123,L475800,u7328,m495,EARL,Absolutely positively.
247124,L475799,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
247125,L475796,u7328,m495,EARL,"You've done without it long enough, ma."
247126,L475795,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Well I don't know --
247127,L475794,u7328,m495,EARL,"Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it."
247128,L475793,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Don't you want it?
247129,L475792,u7328,m495,EARL,Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
247130,L475791,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,This whole place?
247131,L475790,u7328,m495,EARL,"Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place."
247132,L475789,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,That's great Earl!
247133,L475788,u7328,m495,EARL,And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
247134,L475787,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
247135,L475785,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well..."
247136,L475784,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,And what happened?
247137,L475783,u7328,m495,EARL,"There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks..."
247138,L475780,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,You do?
247139,L475779,u7328,m495,EARL,Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
247140,L475778,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Are you hungry?
247141,L475777,u7328,m495,EARL,At least around here it does.
247142,L475776,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
247143,L475775,u7328,m495,EARL,"Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool."
247144,L475774,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Did they ever find out who they were?
247145,L475773,u7328,m495,EARL,"It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say."
247146,L475772,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
247147,L475771,u7328,m495,EARL,"Well, same ol' same ol'."
247148,L475770,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,How's work?
247149,L475769,u7328,m495,EARL,Yeah.
247150,L475768,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Is that the mail?
247151,L475767,u7328,m495,EARL,I was in the neighborhood.
247152,L475766,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,I didn't know you were coming.
247153,L475765,u7329,m495,EARL'S MOTHER,Hi.
247154,L475764,u7328,m495,EARL,Hi ma.
247155,L476078,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
247156,L476077,u7334,m495,WALLACE,I'm not getting an answer.
247157,L476076,u7331,m495,MARTIN,This isn't right...
247158,L476073,u7334,m495,WALLACE,What do you think?  Heart attack?
247159,L476072,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Yeah.
247160,L476057,u7331,m495,MARTIN,We're going to find out.
247161,L476056,u7334,m495,WALLACE,You think he skipped town?
247162,L476055,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!"
247163,L476054,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"He didn't make it into work, and he's not home."
247164,L475647,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?"
247165,L475646,u7331,m495,MARTIN,"No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?"
247166,L475645,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense."
247167,L475644,u7331,m495,MARTIN,So someone did get away.
247168,L475643,u7334,m495,WALLACE,That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
247169,L475641,u7331,m495,MARTIN,So...what's the good news?
247170,L475640,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane."
247171,L475639,u7331,m495,MARTIN,That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
247172,L475638,u7334,m495,WALLACE,Not in the trunk.
247173,L475637,u7331,m495,MARTIN,There was more than that.
247174,L475636,u7334,m495,WALLACE,But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
247175,L475635,u7334,m495,WALLACE,Money.
247176,L475634,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Anything in it?
247177,L475633,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth."
247178,L475632,u7331,m495,MARTIN,Give me the bad news.
247179,L475631,u7334,m495,WALLACE,"You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?"
247180,L478251,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!"
247181,L478250,u7336,m496,CAPTAIN DIEL,"No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?"
247182,L478249,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely."
247183,L478248,u7336,m496,CAPTAIN DIEL,"I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?"
247184,L478247,u7337,m496,CARTER,Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
247185,L478246,u7336,m496,CAPTAIN DIEL,"Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there."
247186,L478245,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit."
247187,L478244,u7336,m496,CAPTAIN DIEL,It's nine-thirty in the morning.
247188,L478243,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?"
247189,L478242,u7336,m496,CAPTAIN DIEL,"Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?"
247190,L478723,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
247191,L478722,u7338,m496,CRAPS DEALER,"Winner!  Four, winner!"
247192,L478701,u7337,m496,CARTER,Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
247193,L478700,u7338,m496,CRAPS DEALER,Two-hundred thousand!
247194,L478699,u7337,m496,CARTER,How much is that?
247195,L478698,u7338,m496,CRAPS DEALER,Winner six!
247196,L478686,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?"
247197,L478685,u7338,m496,CRAPS DEALER,"No, sir."
247198,L478684,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?"
247199,L478683,u7338,m496,CRAPS DEALER,"No, I just assumed..."
247200,L478682,u7337,m496,CARTER,Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
247201,L478681,u7338,m496,CRAPS DEALER,Those are five hundred dollar chips.
247202,L478680,u7337,m496,CARTER,What the hell is that?
247203,L478280,u7339,m496,DOORMAN #1,Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
247204,L478279,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?"
247205,L478278,u7339,m496,DOORMAN #1,Wait.
247206,L478277,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests."
247207,L478276,u7339,m496,DOORMAN #1,The band has been playing over an hour.
247208,L478275,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
247209,L478274,u7339,m496,DOORMAN #1,"Invitation, please."
247210,L478540,u7337,m496,CARTER,"All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now."
247211,L478539,u7342,m496,KENNY,I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
247212,L478533,u7342,m496,KENNY,"One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%."
247213,L478532,u7337,m496,CARTER,What?
247214,L478531,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference."
247215,L478530,u7342,m496,KENNY,"I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?"
247216,L478529,u7337,m496,CARTER,So tell me what you know.
247217,L478528,u7342,m496,KENNY,"You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about."
247218,L478527,u7337,m496,CARTER,How'd you know?
247219,L478526,u7342,m496,KENNY,Is this about the funny money?
247220,L478525,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around."
247221,L478515,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'd like to see you try.
247222,L478514,u7342,m496,KENNY,"Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass."
247223,L478513,u7337,m496,CARTER,Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
247224,L478512,u7342,m496,KENNY,"James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?"
247225,L478511,u7337,m496,CARTER,"And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down."
247226,L478510,u7342,m496,KENNY,I got my sources.
247227,L478509,u7337,m496,CARTER,What??  Where'd you hear that?
247228,L478508,u7342,m496,KENNY,"Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James."
247229,L478491,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation."
247230,L478490,u7337,m496,CARTER,What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
247231,L478489,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
247232,L478484,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market."
247233,L478483,u7337,m496,CARTER,How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
247234,L478482,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
247235,L478481,u7337,m496,CARTER,It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
247236,L478478,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
247237,L478477,u7337,m496,CARTER,So what's your story?
247238,L478476,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"Look, I've been working this case for months now..."
247239,L478475,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
247240,L478474,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Yeah, that's right."
247241,L478469,u7337,m496,CARTER,How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
247242,L478468,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
247243,L478467,u7337,m496,CARTER,Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
247244,L478466,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction."
247245,L478297,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work."
247246,L478296,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party."
247247,L478295,u7337,m496,CARTER,Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
247248,L478294,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was ""Red Dragon."""
247249,L478293,u7337,m496,CARTER,Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
247250,L478292,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?"
247251,L478291,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes."
247252,L478290,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,El Capitan?
247253,L478289,u7337,m496,CARTER,"That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan."
247254,L478288,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,This is your ship?
247255,L478287,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship."
247256,L478286,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,I don't think so.
247257,L478285,u7337,m496,CARTER,San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
247258,L478284,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken."
247259,L478283,u7337,m496,CARTER,"How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria."
247260,L478783,u7337,m496,CARTER,"C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down."
247261,L478782,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?"
247262,L478778,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Lee, you okay?"
247263,L478777,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
247264,L478321,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key."
247265,L478320,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
247266,L478209,u7337,m496,CARTER,"That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted."
247267,L478208,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector."
247268,L478207,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
247269,L478206,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,I don't think so...
247270,L478205,u7337,m496,CARTER,Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
247271,L478201,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!"
247272,L478200,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?"
247273,L478199,u7337,m496,CARTER,I said get on your feet!
247274,L478198,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,I'm busy at the moment.
247275,L478184,u7337,m496,CARTER,"She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet."
247276,L478183,u7340,m496,HOSTESS,"Oh yes, she's very nice."
247277,L478182,u7337,m496,CARTER,Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
247278,L478181,u7340,m496,HOSTESS,You pick any girl for you and your friend.
247279,L478180,u7337,m496,CARTER,No.  It's my first time.
247280,L478179,u7340,m496,HOSTESS,You get massage from Chinese girl before?
247281,L478178,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money."
247282,L478177,u7340,m496,HOSTESS,You bring American money?
247283,L478176,u7337,m496,CARTER,That's right.
247284,L478175,u7340,m496,HOSTESS,"Oh, you American?"
247285,L478662,u7347,m496,STEVEN REIGN,"You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house."
247286,L478661,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius."
247287,L478660,u7347,m496,STEVEN REIGN,Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
247288,L478659,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz..."
247289,L478658,u7347,m496,STEVEN REIGN,"Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong."
247290,L478657,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot."
247291,L478301,u7347,m496,STEVEN REIGN,"I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights."
247292,L478300,u7337,m496,CARTER,Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
247293,L478820,u7343,m496,LEE,"Amen to that, brother."
247294,L478819,u7337,m496,CARTER,I could use a little vacation.
247295,L478818,u7337,m496,CARTER,Some Kung-Pao?
247296,L478817,u7343,m496,LEE,A little Mu-shu.
247297,L478816,u7337,m496,CARTER,The Plaza Hotel?
247298,L478815,u7343,m496,LEE,First class.
247299,L478814,u7337,m496,CARTER,New York City?
247300,L478813,u7343,m496,LEE,I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
247301,L478812,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want."
247302,L478811,u7343,m496,LEE,This money is evidence.
247303,L478810,u7337,m496,CARTER,"They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do."
247304,L478809,u7337,m496,CARTER,"It's okay, I got lots more."
247305,L478808,u7343,m496,LEE,"No, Carter.  I can't take this."
247306,L478807,u7337,m496,CARTER,About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
247307,L478806,u7343,m496,LEE,What is this?
247308,L478804,u7343,m496,LEE,It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
247309,L478803,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this."
247310,L478801,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You take care of yourself, Lee."
247311,L478800,u7343,m496,LEE,"I guess so.  Thank you, Carter."
247312,L478799,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
247313,L478798,u7343,m496,LEE,Yes.
247314,L478797,u7337,m496,CARTER,That your gate down there?
247315,L478796,u7343,m496,LEE,She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
247316,L478795,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back."
247317,L478791,u7343,m496,LEE,No problem.
247318,L478790,u7337,m496,CARTER,"We made it, man."
247319,L478781,u7343,m496,LEE,It's worth it to me.
247320,L478780,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this."
247321,L478751,u7337,m496,CARTER,Just GO!
247322,L478750,u7343,m496,LEE,Carter...
247323,L478749,u7337,m496,CARTER,You go after Ricky.  I got this.
247324,L478747,u7343,m496,LEE,We have to get to the Penthouse.
247325,L478746,u7337,m496,CARTER,What?!?!
247326,L478745,u7343,m496,LEE,Ricky Tan is alive.
247327,L478744,u7343,m496,LEE,Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
247328,L478743,u7337,m496,CARTER,No you didn't!
247329,L478742,u7343,m496,LEE,I did!
247330,L478741,u7337,m496,CARTER,Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
247331,L478736,u7343,m496,LEE,MMMMMM!!!!
247332,L478735,u7337,m496,CARTER,Lee!
247333,L478677,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'll give it my best shot.
247334,L478676,u7343,m496,LEE,Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
247335,L478675,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move."
247336,L478674,u7337,m496,CARTER,Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
247337,L478673,u7343,m496,LEE,No.  I'm going to find out.
247338,L478672,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!"
247339,L478671,u7343,m496,LEE,It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
247340,L478670,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?"
247341,L478669,u7343,m496,LEE,Dancing?
247342,L478668,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Lee, what the hell are you doing?"
247343,L478643,u7337,m496,CARTER,Wait here.  I'll handle this.
247344,L478642,u7343,m496,LEE,Carter...here comes the rich white man.
247345,L478636,u7337,m496,CARTER,Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
247346,L478635,u7343,m496,LEE,Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
247347,L478634,u7337,m496,CARTER,That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
247348,L478629,u7343,m496,LEE,Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
247349,L478628,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case."
247350,L478623,u7337,m496,CARTER,Follow me my Asian brother.
247351,L478622,u7343,m496,LEE,What is Mac out?
247352,L478621,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out."
247353,L478620,u7343,m496,LEE,Let's go.
247354,L478619,u7337,m496,CARTER,That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
247355,L478618,u7343,m496,LEE,Red Dragon.
247356,L478617,u7337,m496,CARTER,Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
247357,L478616,u7343,m496,LEE,Vegas...
247358,L478614,u7337,m496,CARTER,Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
247359,L478613,u7343,m496,LEE,You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
247360,L478612,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton."
247361,L478611,u7343,m496,LEE,"You've been a good friend, James Carter."
247362,L478610,u7337,m496,CARTER,End of the line.
247363,L478609,u7343,m496,LEE,We're slowing down.  This must be it.
247364,L478607,u7337,m496,CARTER,Now that I believe.
247365,L478606,u7343,m496,LEE,Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
247366,L478605,u7337,m496,CARTER,No Chinese man discovered electricity.
247367,L478604,u7343,m496,LEE,A Chinese man discovered electricity.
247368,L478603,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity."
247369,L478602,u7343,m496,LEE,Who's Benjamin?
247370,L478601,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Hello, Benjamin."
247371,L478600,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
247372,L478599,u7343,m496,LEE,"It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike."
247373,L478598,u7337,m496,CARTER,Very nice.
247374,L478595,u7337,m496,CARTER,Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
247375,L478594,u7343,m496,LEE,"They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head."
247376,L478593,u7337,m496,CARTER,That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
247377,L478592,u7343,m496,LEE,I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
247378,L478591,u7337,m496,CARTER,As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
247379,L478590,u7343,m496,LEE,Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
247380,L478589,u7337,m496,CARTER,Are you serious?
247381,L478588,u7343,m496,LEE,"Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?"
247382,L478587,u7337,m496,CARTER,"That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy."
247383,L478586,u7343,m496,LEE,"Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk."
247384,L478585,u7337,m496,CARTER,Steamed dumplings?
247385,L478584,u7343,m496,LEE,No kung pao chicken.  Never.
247386,L478583,u7337,m496,CARTER,What about a little king pao chicken?
247387,L478582,u7343,m496,LEE,No mu-shu.
247388,L478581,u7337,m496,CARTER,You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
247389,L478580,u7343,m496,LEE,There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
247390,L478579,u7337,m496,CARTER,How was the sex?
247391,L478578,u7343,m496,LEE,Mind your own business.
247392,L478577,u7337,m496,CARTER,"If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her."
247393,L478576,u7343,m496,LEE,No.
247394,L478575,u7337,m496,CARTER,You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
247395,L478574,u7337,m496,CARTER,Fine by me.
247396,L478573,u7343,m496,LEE,I think we should stop talking.
247397,L478572,u7337,m496,CARTER,I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
247398,L478571,u7343,m496,LEE,What's a Chinese heaven?
247399,L478570,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?"
247400,L478569,u7343,m496,LEE,Yes.  We have heaven.
247401,L478568,u7337,m496,CARTER,I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
247402,L478567,u7343,m496,LEE,Fine.
247403,L478566,u7337,m496,CARTER,I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
247404,L478565,u7343,m496,LEE,See you in the next world.
247405,L478564,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace."
247406,L478563,u7343,m496,LEE,Fine with me.
247407,L478562,u7337,m496,CARTER,You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
247408,L478561,u7343,m496,LEE,Well we're not friends.
247409,L478560,u7337,m496,CARTER,"We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead."
247410,L478559,u7343,m496,LEE,I'm not used to having a partner.
247411,L478558,u7337,m496,CARTER,It doesn't matter.
247412,L478557,u7343,m496,LEE,Why did you help me?
247413,L478556,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I'm about to be killed and you ""Shhh"" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you."
247414,L478555,u7343,m496,LEE,"Shhh, my head hurts."
247415,L478554,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her."
247416,L478553,u7337,m496,CARTER,"For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides."
247417,L478552,u7343,m496,LEE,She saved our lives.
247418,L478551,u7337,m496,CARTER,What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
247419,L478550,u7343,m496,LEE,Are you okay?
247420,L478503,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance."
247421,L478502,u7343,m496,LEE,"I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy."
247422,L478501,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly."
247423,L478500,u7343,m496,LEE,She never even looked at you.
247424,L478499,u7337,m496,CARTER,"They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me."
247425,L478498,u7343,m496,LEE,We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
247426,L478497,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy."
247427,L478471,u7343,m496,LEE,We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
247428,L478470,u7337,m496,CARTER,Let me see it again?
247429,L478465,u7343,m496,LEE,It's a bomb.
247430,L478464,u7337,m496,CARTER,I wouldn't do that!!!
247431,L478462,u7337,m496,CARTER,Take it!
247432,L478461,u7343,m496,LEE,Get it out of here!
247433,L478460,u7337,m496,CARTER,There's people up here!
247434,L478459,u7343,m496,LEE,Wait!  There's people down there!
247435,L478452,u7337,m496,CARTER,I don't need a turn!
247436,L478451,u7343,m496,LEE,It's your turn!
247437,L478450,u7337,m496,CARTER,Pick it up!
247438,L478444,u7337,m496,CARTER,She's walking back towards the door.
247439,L478443,u7343,m496,LEE,I don't understand?
247440,L478442,u7337,m496,CARTER,"No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired..."
247441,L478441,u7343,m496,LEE,What is it?
247442,L478440,u7337,m496,CARTER,"She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick."
247443,L478439,u7343,m496,LEE,What?
247444,L478438,u7337,m496,CARTER,Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
247445,L478435,u7337,m496,CARTER,She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
247446,L478434,u7343,m496,LEE,Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
247447,L478433,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy."
247448,L478432,u7343,m496,LEE,I don't want to hear this.
247449,L478431,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Oh, sweet glory hallelujah..."
247450,L478430,u7343,m496,LEE,What's she doing?
247451,L478429,u7337,m496,CARTER,Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
247452,L478428,u7343,m496,LEE,No.  It's not right.
247453,L478427,u7337,m496,CARTER,Gimme the binoculars.
247454,L478426,u7343,m496,LEE,She's getting undressed.
247455,L478425,u7337,m496,CARTER,What's going on?
247456,L478424,u7343,m496,LEE,I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
247457,L478423,u7337,m496,CARTER,Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
247458,L478422,u7343,m496,LEE,Is it hot in here?
247459,L478421,u7343,m496,LEE,Nothing.  I said nothing.
247460,L478420,u7337,m496,CARTER,What did you say?
247461,L478419,u7343,m496,LEE,"Slow down, baby."
247462,L478418,u7343,m496,LEE,I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
247463,L478417,u7337,m496,CARTER,Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
247464,L478416,u7343,m496,LEE,She's just standing around -- not doing much.
247465,L478412,u7343,m496,LEE,She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
247466,L478411,u7337,m496,CARTER,Excuse me?
247467,L478410,u7343,m496,LEE,No.  It was my singing.
247468,L478409,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times."
247469,L478408,u7343,m496,LEE,It's a long story.
247470,L478407,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?"
247471,L478406,u7343,m496,LEE,My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
247472,L478405,u7337,m496,CARTER,You pull a muscle or something?
247473,L478404,u7343,m496,LEE,"The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months."
247474,L478403,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic."
247475,L478402,u7343,m496,LEE,"Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now."
247476,L478401,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over."
247477,L478400,u7343,m496,LEE,How do you know?
247478,L478399,u7337,m496,CARTER,He'll be back soon.
247479,L478398,u7343,m496,LEE,He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
247480,L478397,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?"
247481,L478396,u7337,m496,CARTER,"The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear."
247482,L478395,u7343,m496,LEE,Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
247483,L478394,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off."
247484,L478393,u7343,m496,LEE,Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
247485,L478392,u7337,m496,CARTER,Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
247486,L478391,u7343,m496,LEE,You sound like that all the time.
247487,L478390,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like ""Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!"
247488,L478389,u7343,m496,LEE,How do you know he's our man?
247489,L478388,u7337,m496,CARTER,Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
247490,L478387,u7343,m496,LEE,Who?
247491,L478386,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign."
247492,L478385,u7343,m496,LEE,Follow the RichWhiteMan...
247493,L478384,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Almost, but you've got to say ""Rich White Man"" all run together like it's one word."
247494,L478383,u7343,m496,LEE,Follow the Rich White Man?
247495,L478382,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man."
247496,L478381,u7343,m496,LEE,I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
247497,L478380,u7337,m496,CARTER,I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
247498,L478379,u7343,m496,LEE,Why LA?
247499,L478378,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane."
247500,L478377,u7337,m496,CARTER,"-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it."
247501,L478376,u7343,m496,LEE,You said --
247502,L478375,u7337,m496,CARTER,It sounds impossible --
247503,L478374,u7343,m496,LEE,I cannot go to LA...
247504,L478373,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first."
247505,L478372,u7343,m496,LEE,What?
247506,L478371,u7337,m496,CARTER,So are you getting on the plane or not?!
247507,L478370,u7343,m496,LEE,I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
247508,L478369,u7337,m496,CARTER,IT IS CRAZY!
247509,L478368,u7343,m496,LEE,I thought you'd think it was crazy.
247510,L478367,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You thought the ""Customs Agents get blown up"" and ""smuggling"" and ""Ricky Tan"" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing..."
247511,L478366,u7343,m496,LEE,"No, no, that would be crazy --"
247512,L478365,u7337,m496,CARTER,"This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?"
247513,L478364,u7343,m496,LEE,"All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly."
247514,L478363,u7337,m496,CARTER,How the hell did Tan get away with it?
247515,L478362,u7343,m496,LEE,"He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty."
247516,L478360,u7337,m496,CARTER,Ask me if I give a shit.
247517,L478359,u7343,m496,LEE,"Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case."
247518,L478358,u7337,m496,CARTER,Forget it.
247519,L478357,u7343,m496,LEE,Good at what?
247520,L478356,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You're not very good at this, are you?"
247521,L478355,u7343,m496,LEE,No.  She's a school teacher.
247522,L478354,u7337,m496,CARTER,I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
247523,L478353,u7343,m496,LEE,Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
247524,L478352,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy."
247525,L478351,u7343,m496,LEE,I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
247526,L478350,u7337,m496,CARTER,"What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?"
247527,L478327,u7337,m496,CARTER,What the hell is going on here?
247528,L478326,u7343,m496,LEE,Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
247529,L478325,u7337,m496,CARTER,Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
247530,L478324,u7343,m496,LEE,"I'm okay, you go."
247531,L478323,u7337,m496,CARTER,"What, leave you alone so he can cap you?"
247532,L478314,u7337,m496,CARTER,Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
247533,L478313,u7343,m496,LEE,Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
247534,L478312,u7337,m496,CARTER,Who?
247535,L478311,u7343,m496,LEE,Not Yu.  You!
247536,L478310,u7337,m496,CARTER,Detective Yu?  Never met him.
247537,L478309,u7343,m496,LEE,You.
247538,L478308,u7337,m496,CARTER,Who died?
247539,L478307,u7343,m496,LEE,Carter?
247540,L478233,u7337,m496,CARTER,And you ain't black!
247541,L478232,u7343,m496,LEE,You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
247542,L478231,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?"
247543,L478230,u7343,m496,LEE,I have plenty of dates.
247544,L478229,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?"
247545,L478228,u7343,m496,LEE,It's my job!
247546,L478227,u7337,m496,CARTER,My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
247547,L478226,u7343,m496,LEE,Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
247548,L478225,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards."
247549,L478224,u7343,m496,LEE,Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
247550,L478223,u7337,m496,CARTER,Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
247551,L478222,u7343,m496,LEE,Where are you going?
247552,L478213,u7343,m496,LEE,Don't look at my ass!
247553,L478212,u7337,m496,CARTER,Goddamn you got a small ass.
247554,L478196,u7343,m496,LEE,I'm calling for back up!
247555,L478195,u7337,m496,CARTER,I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
247556,L478194,u7343,m496,LEE,This is a very dangerous man.
247557,L478193,u7337,m496,CARTER,"That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down."
247558,L478192,u7343,m496,LEE,Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
247559,L478191,u7337,m496,CARTER,What's wrong?
247560,L478188,u7337,m496,CARTER,Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
247561,L478187,u7343,m496,LEE,"Well, hurry up."
247562,L478186,u7337,m496,CARTER,She said I could pick any girl I want.
247563,L478185,u7343,m496,LEE,What are you doing?
247564,L478174,u7343,m496,LEE,"My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time."
247565,L478173,u7337,m496,CARTER,How you doin'?
247566,L478172,u7343,m496,LEE,Hello.
247567,L478170,u7337,m496,CARTER,I am a tourist.
247568,L478169,u7343,m496,LEE,Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
247569,L478168,u7343,m496,LEE,Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
247570,L478167,u7337,m496,CARTER,And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
247571,L478143,u7343,m496,LEE,This won't take long.
247572,L478142,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner."
247573,L478140,u7343,m496,LEE,No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
247574,L478139,u7337,m496,CARTER,"You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home."
247575,L478138,u7343,m496,LEE,I'm sorry.
247576,L478137,u7337,m496,CARTER,You lied to me.
247577,L478135,u7343,m496,LEE,Try to land on your feet.
247578,L478134,u7337,m496,CARTER,All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
247579,L478124,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out."
247580,L478123,u7343,m496,LEE,You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
247581,L478122,u7337,m496,CARTER,What'd I say?
247582,L478120,u7337,m496,CARTER,You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
247583,L478119,u7343,m496,LEE,"No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto."
247584,L478118,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done."
247585,L478117,u7343,m496,LEE,"Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China."
247586,L478116,u7337,m496,CARTER,Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
247587,L478115,u7343,m496,LEE,"No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open."
247588,L478114,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing."
247589,L478113,u7343,m496,LEE,I'm sorry.
247590,L478112,u7337,m496,CARTER,I knew you were lying.
247591,L478111,u7343,m496,LEE,"This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover."
247592,L478110,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!"
247593,L478109,u7343,m496,LEE,"Carter, get off that stage!"
247594,L478105,u7343,m496,LEE,Bathroom.
247595,L478104,u7337,m496,CARTER,Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
247596,L478103,u7343,m496,LEE,"I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in."
247597,L478102,u7337,m496,CARTER,Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
247598,L478101,u7343,m496,LEE,No.
247599,L478100,u7337,m496,CARTER,Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
247600,L478099,u7337,m496,CARTER,You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
247601,L478098,u7343,m496,LEE,No.
247602,L478097,u7337,m496,CARTER,That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
247603,L478096,u7343,m496,LEE,"Carter, would I lie to you?"
247604,L478095,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty."
247605,L478094,u7343,m496,LEE,Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
247606,L478088,u7337,m496,CARTER,Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
247607,L478087,u7343,m496,LEE,Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
247608,L478086,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu."
247609,L478085,u7343,m496,LEE,"You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two."
247610,L478084,u7337,m496,CARTER,"I said that?  Which word was ""goat?"""
247611,L478083,u7343,m496,LEE,You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
247612,L478082,u7337,m496,CARTER,All I did was invite them for a drink.
247613,L478081,u7343,m496,LEE,Those girls drove off because of you.
247614,L478080,u7337,m496,CARTER,Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
247615,L478079,u7343,m496,LEE,That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
247616,L478078,u7337,m496,CARTER,I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
247617,L478343,u7337,m496,CARTER,Fine with me.
247618,L478342,u7346,m496,SPECIAL AGENT STERLING,"Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A."
247619,L478341,u7337,m496,CARTER,"Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --"
247620,L478340,u7346,m496,SPECIAL AGENT STERLING,"I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?"
247621,L478339,u7337,m496,CARTER,"What ""revenge"" is he talking about?"
247622,L478338,u7346,m496,SPECIAL AGENT STERLING,"Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation."
247623,L478758,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,Now you know.
247624,L478757,u7343,m496,LEE,I didn't know which side you were on.
247625,L478756,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,I'm fine.
247626,L478755,u7343,m496,LEE,Are you okay?
247627,L478667,u7343,m496,LEE,No.  But I'll help you.
247628,L478666,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
247629,L478665,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,Dip me!
247630,L478664,u7343,m496,LEE,How do I know I can trust you?
247631,L478663,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in."
247632,L478656,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
247633,L478655,u7343,m496,LEE,Why don't you go get them?
247634,L478654,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
247635,L478653,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
247636,L478652,u7343,m496,LEE,Just trying to make it look real.
247637,L478651,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,You move well.
247638,L478650,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
247639,L478649,u7343,m496,LEE,Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
247640,L478648,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,I need your help.
247641,L478647,u7343,m496,LEE,What's going on?
247642,L478645,u7343,m496,LEE,Excuse me?
247643,L478644,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,Put your arms around me.
247644,L478488,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake."
247645,L478487,u7343,m496,LEE,And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
247646,L478486,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
247647,L478480,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
247648,L478479,u7343,m496,LEE,Is this a payoff?
247649,L478473,u7343,m496,LEE,Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
247650,L478472,u7341,m496,ISABELLA,"I know who you are, Inspector Lee."
247651,L478535,u7342,m496,KENNY,I still have my lunch money from third grade.
247652,L478534,u7343,m496,LEE,Do you still have the bills?
247653,L478523,u7342,m496,KENNY,That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
247654,L478522,u7343,m496,LEE,Baby Duck?
247655,L478521,u7342,m496,KENNY,What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
247656,L478520,u7342,m496,KENNY,"No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw."
247657,L478519,u7343,m496,LEE,"The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?"
247658,L478518,u7342,m496,KENNY,Master Ching taught me.
247659,L478346,u7343,m496,LEE,I'll take him.
247660,L478345,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
247661,L478271,u7343,m496,LEE,Thank you.
247662,L478270,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
247663,L478269,u7343,m496,LEE,Did you tell Sterling?
247664,L478268,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,"Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to..."
247665,L478262,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,"Are you okay, Lee?"
247666,L478261,u7343,m496,LEE,All he wanted was some mu-shu.
247667,L478235,u7343,m496,LEE,The Secret Service?  Why?
247668,L478234,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,"Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service."
247669,L478092,u7343,m496,LEE,It's my responsibility.
247670,L478091,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,"We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand."
247671,L478090,u7343,m496,LEE,Any leads?
247672,L478089,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,"Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed."
247673,L478775,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
247674,L478774,u7343,m496,LEE,"If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you."
247675,L478773,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did."
247676,L478772,u7343,m496,LEE,Put the plates down.  It's over.
247677,L478771,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery."
247678,L478334,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor..."
247679,L478333,u7343,m496,LEE,Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
247680,L478332,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong."
247681,L478331,u7343,m496,LEE,The police can protect you.
247682,L478330,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death."
247683,L478329,u7343,m496,LEE,Don't.
247684,L478328,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
247685,L478204,u7343,m496,LEE,You must come with me for questioning.
247686,L478203,u7345,m496,RICKY TAN,"Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure."
247687,L478164,u7344,m496,MASTER FU,"It's a massage parlor downtown.  ""Heaven on Earth.""  You will find your answers there."
247688,L478163,u7343,m496,LEE,"Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --"
247689,L478162,u7344,m496,MASTER FU,The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
247690,L478161,u7343,m496,LEE,"I know, Master, but..."
247691,L478160,u7344,m496,MASTER FU,A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
247692,L478158,u7344,m496,MASTER FU,No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
247693,L478157,u7343,m496,LEE,Ricky Tan?
247694,L478156,u7344,m496,MASTER FU,"He was the best I ever trained, you know."
247695,L478155,u7344,m496,MASTER FU,Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
247696,L478154,u7343,m496,LEE,"I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal."
247697,L478149,u7343,m496,LEE,"Yes, Master."
247698,L478148,u7344,m496,MASTER FU,Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
247699,L478221,u7346,m496,SPECIAL AGENT STERLING,"Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee."
247700,L478220,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.

247704,L478216,u7346,m496,SPECIAL AGENT STERLING,Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
247705,L478215,u7348,m496,SUPERINDENDENT CHIN,This is still Hong Kong.
247706,L478214,u7346,m496,SPECIAL AGENT STERLING,"Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us."
247707,L477745,u7355,m497,MAN'S VOICE,"The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter."

247709,L477743,u7355,m497,MAN'S VOICE,Shut up!
247710,L477742,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!"
247711,L477741,u7355,m497,MAN'S VOICE,Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
247712,L477740,u7349,m497,CARTER,That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.

247718,L477733,u7349,m497,CARTER,Lee!  It's him!
247719,L477732,u7355,m497,MAN'S VOICE,"The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk."
247720,L477731,u7349,m497,CARTER,You know what a phone booth is?!
247721,L477381,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my ""still""."

247723,L477459,u7350,m497,DIEL,"Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it."
247724,L477458,u7349,m497,CARTER,"And that, of course, would be me."
247725,L477457,u7350,m497,DIEL,They asked for the best street man I had.
247726,L477456,u7349,m497,CARTER,Feds asked for me?
247727,L477455,u7350,m497,DIEL,I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.

247729,L477453,u7350,m497,DIEL,Good job.
247730,L477452,u7350,m497,DIEL,That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
247731,L477451,u7349,m497,CARTER,"I know, but --"
247732,L477450,u7350,m497,DIEL,What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.

247877,L477523,u7349,m497,CARTER,You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
247878,L477522,u7354,m497,LEE,Beach Boy.
247879,L477517,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that."
247880,L477516,u7354,m497,LEE,You talk very fast.
247881,L478068,u7349,m497,CARTER,Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
247882,L478067,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,How about a lift home?
247883,L478066,u7349,m497,CARTER,Not to me. Never to me.
247884,L478065,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
247885,L478064,u7349,m497,CARTER,Yeah. So why you look do down?
247886,L478063,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,"We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?"
247887,L478062,u7349,m497,CARTER,You OK?
247888,L478021,u7349,m497,CARTER,It's okay. For restaurants.
247889,L478020,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,You don't like it?
247890,L478005,u7349,m497,CARTER,"That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!"
247891,L478004,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,"Yeah, if you're Superfly."
247892,L478003,u7349,m497,CARTER,"What?! This is a class ride, Johnson."
247893,L478002,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
247894,L477996,u7349,m497,CARTER,It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
247895,L477995,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,It's called a dress.
247896,L477994,u7349,m497,CARTER,Oh my god...what happened to you?
247897,L477971,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?"
247898,L477970,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
247899,L477969,u7349,m497,CARTER,This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
247900,L477968,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,Jesus...what do you want?
247901,L477967,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something."
247902,L477966,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
247903,L477965,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust."
247904,L477964,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,You got a lot of guts calling me.
247905,L477676,u7349,m497,CARTER,"No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby."
247906,L477675,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
247907,L477504,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
247908,L477503,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it."
247909,L477502,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,"Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?"
247910,L477501,u7349,m497,CARTER,In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
247911,L477500,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,They put you in charge?
247912,L477499,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team."
247913,L477498,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
247914,L477497,u7349,m497,CARTER,How'd what go?
247915,L477469,u7349,m497,CARTER,"I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?"
247916,L477468,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,What's wrong with that?
247917,L477467,u7349,m497,CARTER,I could get promoted right out of here.
247918,L477466,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,No...what?
247919,L477465,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?"
247920,L477464,u7349,m497,CARTER,FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
247921,L477463,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,The Feds?!
247922,L477462,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds."
247923,L477447,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks."
247924,L477446,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
247925,L477439,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Oh, baby, you cruel..."
247926,L477438,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,"Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours."
247927,L477437,u7349,m497,CARTER,You're killin' me here.
247928,L477417,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,Where'd you get it?
247929,L477416,u7349,m497,CARTER,Not anymore.
247930,L477396,u7352,m497,JOHNSON,Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
247931,L477395,u7349,m497,CARTER,Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
247932,L477940,u7356,m497,RUSS,"And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you."
247933,L477939,u7349,m497,CARTER,What?!
247934,L477938,u7356,m497,RUSS,"I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment."
247935,L477937,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night..."
247936,L477756,u7349,m497,CARTER,"No, sir. I'm as good as it gets."
247937,L477755,u7356,m497,RUSS,Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
247938,L477754,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?"
247939,L477753,u7349,m497,CARTER,Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
247940,L477752,u7356,m497,RUSS,Don't play bullshit games with me.
247941,L477751,u7349,m497,CARTER,Hmmmm?
247942,L477726,u7356,m497,RUSS,That's what you were supposed to be!
247943,L477725,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!"
247944,L477724,u7356,m497,RUSS,"You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!"
247945,L477723,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Yo, Johnson..."
247946,L477640,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Carter, shut up!"
247947,L477639,u7349,m497,CARTER,You understand what I'm sayin'?
247948,L477637,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --"
247949,L477636,u7356,m497,RUSS,What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
247950,L477494,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late."
247951,L477493,u7349,m497,CARTER,What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
247952,L477492,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job."
247953,L477491,u7349,m497,CARTER,Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
247954,L477490,u7356,m497,RUSS,Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
247955,L477489,u7349,m497,CARTER,What kind of assignment is that?
247956,L477488,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee."
247957,L477487,u7349,m497,CARTER,I'm talking about the girl.
247958,L477486,u7356,m497,RUSS,He is the situation.
247959,L477485,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation..."
247960,L477484,u7356,m497,RUSS,"... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason."
247961,L477481,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte."
247962,L477480,u7356,m497,RUSS,"You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent."
247963,L477479,u7349,m497,CARTER,How much they want?
247964,L477478,u7356,m497,RUSS,At this point we don't have much.
247965,L477477,u7349,m497,CARTER,Any demands yet?
247966,L477819,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
247967,L477818,u7349,m497,CARTER,Where do we find him?
247968,L477815,u7349,m497,CARTER,I'm waitin' here for a name.
247969,L477814,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,You sonuvabitch.
247970,L477813,u7349,m497,CARTER,"All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella."
247971,L477812,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
247972,L477811,u7349,m497,CARTER,"You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO."
247973,L477810,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,What are you talking about?
247974,L477809,u7349,m497,CARTER,You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
247975,L477412,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,Do it!
247976,L477411,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?"
247977,L477402,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
247978,L477401,u7349,m497,CARTER,What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
247979,L477398,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,What are you talking about?
247980,L477397,u7349,m497,CARTER,"You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk."
247981,L477391,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?"
247982,L477390,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,Nobody touches me.
247983,L477389,u7349,m497,CARTER,I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
247984,L477388,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
247985,L477387,u7349,m497,CARTER,"This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him."
247986,L477385,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,Or somethin'.
247987,L477384,u7349,m497,CARTER,You a cop or something?
247988,L477383,u7353,m497,LAFONTAINE,Shut up!
247989,L477382,u7349,m497,CARTER,"Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother..."
247990,L477993,u7351,m497,HAN,I want to speak with my daughter!
247991,L477992,u7357,m497,SANG'S VOICE,Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
247992,L477991,u7351,m497,HAN,Hello.
247993,L477953,u7351,m497,HAN,"Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --"
247994,L477952,u7357,m497,SANG'S VOICE,You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
247995,L477951,u7351,m497,HAN,Yes.
247996,L477647,u7351,m497,HAN,Can I speak with her?
247997,L477646,u7357,m497,SANG'S VOICE,She's fine.
247998,L477645,u7351,m497,HAN,My daughter.
247999,L477644,u7357,m497,SANG'S VOICE,"Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying."

248003,L477891,u7355,m497,MAN'S VOICE,Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
248004,L477890,u7351,m497,HAN,I do.
248005,L477889,u7355,m497,MAN'S VOICE,You have what I asked for?

248011,L477532,u7351,m497,HAN,Hello.
248012,L477823,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Don't worry, he's with Carter."
248013,L477822,u7351,m497,HAN,And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
248014,L477821,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em."
248015,L477820,u7351,m497,HAN,I am so sorry about your men.
248016,L477634,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Carter, can I have a moment?"
248017,L477633,u7351,m497,HAN,Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
248018,L477433,u7351,m497,HAN,He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
248019,L477432,u7356,m497,RUSS,"I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States..."
248020,L477431,u7351,m497,HAN,"I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American."
248021,L477430,u7356,m497,RUSS,"As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need."
248022,L477429,u7351,m497,HAN,He is very good.
248023,L477428,u7356,m497,RUSS,"Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case."
248024,L477427,u7351,m497,HAN,I would like one of my people to help.
248025,L477378,u7354,m497,LEE,"Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place."
248026,L477377,u7358,m497,SOON YOUNG,I will not have friends in America.
248027,L477375,u7358,m497,SOON YOUNG,After I left?
248028,L477374,u7354,m497,LEE,I was trying to find the right time.
248029,L477373,u7358,m497,SOON YOUNG,I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
248030,L477372,u7354,m497,LEE,I still have work to do here.
248031,L477371,u7358,m497,SOON YOUNG,When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?

248034,L479933,u7360,m498,BOB,"I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift."
248035,L479932,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Right.
248036,L479729,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
248037,L479728,u7360,m498,BOB,"So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade."
248038,L479727,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I'm not running.

248041,L479724,u7360,m498,BOB,"Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game."
248042,L479723,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?"
248043,L479719,u7360,m498,BOB,I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
248044,L479718,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
248045,L479716,u7360,m498,BOB,Ike just came by to check out the team.
248046,L479715,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What is he up to now?
248047,L480192,u7360,m498,BOB,Maintain eye contact.
248048,L480191,u7366,m498,IKE,Got any last minute advice?
248049,L480190,u7360,m498,BOB,I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
248050,L480189,u7366,m498,IKE,Really?
248051,L480187,u7366,m498,IKE,Thank you.
248052,L480186,u7360,m498,BOB,You look awful.
248053,L480126,u7366,m498,IKE,"How about -- ""I hope you'll be very happy together""?"
248054,L480125,u7360,m498,BOB,What do you expect me to say to this?
248055,L480116,u7360,m498,BOB,Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
248056,L480115,u7366,m498,IKE,"At this pace, it could be an evening wedding."
248057,L479722,u7366,m498,IKE,"You bet ya, Coach."
248058,L479721,u7360,m498,BOB,See you at the wedding.
248059,L479675,u7360,m498,BOB,"I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy."
248060,L479674,u7366,m498,IKE,Ahh.
248061,L479762,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Of course.
248062,L479761,u7361,m498,BRIAN,Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
248063,L479760,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Of course.
248064,L479759,u7361,m498,BRIAN,"I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?"
248065,L479758,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian."
248066,L479756,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
248067,L479755,u7361,m498,BRIAN,He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
248068,L479753,u7361,m498,BRIAN,"God bless you, Maggie."
248069,L479752,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next."
248070,L479751,u7361,m498,BRIAN,It happens to be how I feel.
248071,L479750,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Good one!  Thanks.
248072,L479749,u7361,m498,BRIAN,How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
248073,L479748,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,And what did you say?
248074,L479747,u7361,m498,BRIAN,Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
248075,L479743,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What did he ask?
248076,L479742,u7361,m498,BRIAN,"Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie."
248077,L479741,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
248078,L479740,u7361,m498,BRIAN,"Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad."
248079,L480171,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,He's here!... He's here!
248080,L480170,u7362,m498,CINDY,I'll get the dress.
248081,L480168,u7362,m498,CINDY,We'll rub.
248082,L480167,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,It's hurting.
248083,L480166,u7362,m498,CINDY,We do it to our dog.
248084,L480163,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Eight is good... ""V"" could be Victory."
248085,L480162,u7362,m498,CINDY,"And in a ""V""."
248086,L479579,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully."
248087,L479578,u7362,m498,CINDY,That's it.  Back to obedience school.
248088,L480165,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate."
248089,L480164,u7362,m498,CINDY,Rub your ears.
248090,L480150,u7370,m498,PEGGY,His hair... any color.
248091,L480149,u7362,m498,CINDY,I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
248092,L480112,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"""Never say die."""
248093,L480111,u7362,m498,CINDY,"""Nothing but net."""
248094,L480110,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"""Make the shot."""
248095,L480109,u7362,m498,CINDY,"""Sink the putt."""
248096,L480108,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? ""Be the ball."""
248097,L480107,u7362,m498,CINDY,Bob's in a hurry.
248098,L480096,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
248099,L480095,u7362,m498,CINDY,"Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this."
248100,L480226,u7363,m498,ELLIE,Where do you think she's going?
248101,L480225,u7366,m498,IKE,Maggie!
248102,L480030,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say."
248103,L480029,u7366,m498,IKE,"Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie."
248104,L480028,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"No.  No, you didn't."
248105,L480027,u7366,m498,IKE,Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
248106,L480024,u7366,m498,IKE,"But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be."
248107,L480023,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"Fisher, let him talk."
248108,L479554,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent."
248109,L479553,u7366,m498,IKE,See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
248110,L479552,u7363,m498,ELLIE,I already made an appointment for later today.
248111,L479551,u7366,m498,IKE,"Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you."
248112,L479549,u7366,m498,IKE,I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
248113,L479548,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"No, that's what makes you unemployed."
248114,L479545,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?"
248115,L479544,u7366,m498,IKE,I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
248116,L479543,u7363,m498,ELLIE,That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
248117,L479542,u7366,m498,IKE,Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
248118,L479541,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired."
248119,L479540,u7366,m498,IKE,What?
248120,L479539,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"-- It's for you, Ike."
248121,L479536,u7366,m498,IKE,"So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?"
248122,L479535,u7363,m498,ELLIE,I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
248123,L479534,u7366,m498,IKE,Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
248124,L480224,u7363,m498,ELLIE,Poor Ike.
248125,L480223,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Look, he's in pretty good shape."
248126,L480222,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"Look, he's running after her."
248127,L480020,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"Or does she pick ""NGB'S"" -- ""Nice Guys, But...""  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison."
248128,L480019,u7364,m498,FISHER,Or a vegetarian?
248129,L480018,u7363,m498,ELLIE,"... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?"
248130,L480017,u7364,m498,FISHER,Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
248131,L480196,u7364,m498,FISHER,I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
248132,L480195,u7366,m498,IKE,Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
248133,L480194,u7364,m498,FISHER,I have no idea what I'm doing.
248134,L480184,u7366,m498,IKE,Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
248135,L480183,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best."
248136,L480182,u7366,m498,IKE,Then you'll be my best man.
248137,L480181,u7364,m498,FISHER,Of course we are.  Of course.
248138,L480022,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?"
248139,L480021,u7366,m498,IKE,"No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that..."
248140,L479993,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?..."
248141,L479992,u7366,m498,IKE,"Okay, we'll order out."
248142,L479991,u7364,m498,FISHER,Then come for dinner.
248143,L479990,u7366,m498,IKE,Yeah.
248144,L479989,u7364,m498,FISHER,You're coming here?
248145,L479988,u7366,m498,IKE,Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
248146,L479987,u7366,m498,IKE,I don't know.
248147,L479986,u7364,m498,FISHER,"No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?"
248148,L479985,u7366,m498,IKE,"This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?"
248149,L479984,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention."
248150,L479575,u7366,m498,IKE,Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
248151,L479574,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Don't say ""spec"" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance..."
248152,L479572,u7366,m498,IKE,"But I'll get my normal fee, right?"
248153,L479571,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints."
248154,L479570,u7366,m498,IKE,"""Paid vindication""  That's what I call justice."
248155,L479569,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot."
248156,L479568,u7366,m498,IKE,"Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment."
248157,L479567,u7364,m498,FISHER,"If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate."
248158,L479566,u7366,m498,IKE,"This is good.  It is a good story, Fish."
248159,L479565,u7364,m498,FISHER,It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
248160,L479564,u7366,m498,IKE,The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
248161,L479563,u7364,m498,FISHER,All the gory details.
248162,L479562,u7366,m498,IKE,The real story on Miss Carpenter.
248163,L479561,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct."
248164,L479560,u7366,m498,IKE,"What are you trying to say to me, Fish?"
248165,L479559,u7364,m498,FISHER,"Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now..."
248166,L479547,u7366,m498,IKE,Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
248167,L479546,u7364,m498,FISHER,In vino veritas.
248168,L479538,u7366,m498,IKE,Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
248169,L479537,u7364,m498,FISHER,Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
248170,L480013,u7366,m498,IKE,"Oh, please!"
248171,L480012,u7365,m498,GEORGE,"Unbelievable, she got to you."
248172,L480011,u7366,m498,IKE,No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
248173,L480010,u7365,m498,GEORGE,And you defending her?
248174,L480009,u7366,m498,IKE,I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
248175,L480008,u7365,m498,GEORGE,Why do YOU think she ran?
248176,L480007,u7366,m498,IKE,I don't think that's why she ran.
248177,L480006,u7365,m498,GEORGE,"Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A ""man-eater"", ""a devouring death goddess."""
248178,L480004,u7366,m498,IKE,"Neuter a locust, feed the world."
248179,L480003,u7365,m498,GEORGE,Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
248180,L480002,u7366,m498,IKE,"Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?"
248181,L480001,u7365,m498,GEORGE,"Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame."
248182,L480000,u7366,m498,IKE,"Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony."
248183,L479999,u7365,m498,GEORGE,She's a cacophony of contradictions.
248184,L479998,u7366,m498,IKE,Thanks.
248185,L479997,u7365,m498,GEORGE,"And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned."
248186,L479996,u7366,m498,IKE,You could have told me you were fiance number three.
248187,L479995,u7365,m498,GEORGE,"Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job."
248188,L479994,u7366,m498,IKE,Get this man a Kamikaze.
248189,L480179,u7366,m498,IKE,"No, I'm not."
248190,L480178,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
248191,L479937,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,Tootaloo.
248192,L479936,u7366,m498,IKE,"Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you."
248193,L479612,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,"Oh, I will."
248194,L479611,u7366,m498,IKE,"Good fact.  Well, you let me know."
248195,L479610,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,"I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say."
248196,L479608,u7366,m498,IKE,I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
248197,L479607,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,"It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said."
248198,L479606,u7366,m498,IKE,"Yes, Mrs. Pressman."
248199,L479605,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,"Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you."
248200,L479604,u7366,m498,IKE,"Sorry, no.  I just got one."
248201,L479807,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men..."
248202,L479806,u7366,m498,IKE,It's nice that they're still friends.
248203,L479804,u7366,m498,IKE,That must have made you proud.
248204,L479803,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know."
248205,L479802,u7366,m498,IKE,Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
248206,L479801,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"Have you listened to his morning show, ""Wake up with ballplayer""?"
248207,L479626,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"No, she's talking about your hair."
248208,L479625,u7366,m498,IKE,I think you'd look good in red.
248209,L479596,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
248210,L479595,u7366,m498,IKE,Looking for Maggie.
248211,L479594,u7370,m498,PEGGY,And you are?
248212,L479590,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
248213,L479589,u7366,m498,IKE,I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
248214,L479588,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired."
248215,L479587,u7366,m498,IKE,About her upcoming wedding and all.
248216,L479586,u7370,m498,PEGGY,It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
248217,L479585,u7366,m498,IKE,What?
248218,L479584,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Are you a reporter?
248219,L479583,u7366,m498,IKE,Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
248220,L480199,u7369,m498,MRS. TROUT,"Oh, come on.  You're practically family."
248221,L480198,u7366,m498,IKE,Thank you.
248222,L480197,u7369,m498,MRS. TROUT,You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
248223,L479710,u7366,m498,IKE,"Bye, Betty.  Thanks."
248224,L479709,u7369,m498,MRS. TROUT,Your two cinnamon rolls.
248225,L479699,u7369,m498,MRS. TROUT,-- The luau for Maggie.
248226,L479698,u7366,m498,IKE,"Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --"
248227,L479697,u7369,m498,MRS. TROUT,Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
248228,L479696,u7366,m498,IKE,"Yes, I am.  And who are you?"
248229,L479666,u7371,m498,WALTER,"Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest."
248230,L479665,u7366,m498,IKE,"Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday..."
248231,L479661,u7366,m498,IKE,"Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that."
248232,L479660,u7371,m498,WALTER,Like her mother.
248233,L479657,u7366,m498,IKE,"You know, your daughter seems..."
248234,L479656,u7371,m498,WALTER,"Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know."
248235,L479655,u7366,m498,IKE,"Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?"
248236,L479649,u7371,m498,WALTER,"Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper."
248237,L479648,u7366,m498,IKE,They made me put my hat back on.
248238,L480288,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
248239,L480287,u7366,m498,IKE,"Pretty good speech, Maggie."
248240,L480286,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"""I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me""."
248241,L480285,u7366,m498,IKE,I'm listening.
248242,L480284,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I was, because if you said ""yes"" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?"
248243,L480283,u7366,m498,IKE,You were not.
248244,L480277,u7366,m498,IKE,This is getting serious.
248245,L480276,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
248246,L480275,u7366,m498,IKE,Used?
248247,L480270,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
248248,L480269,u7366,m498,IKE,"Yes, I did."
248249,L480268,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me."
248250,L480267,u7366,m498,IKE,Does it matter?
248251,L480266,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
248252,L480265,u7366,m498,IKE,"You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?"
248253,L480264,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,It's something I've always wanted to do.
248254,L480263,u7366,m498,IKE,"Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific."
248255,L480261,u7366,m498,IKE,"I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!"
248256,L480260,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
248257,L480145,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"So, we'll..."
248258,L480144,u7366,m498,IKE,So am I.
248259,L480143,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I'm okay with that.
248260,L480142,u7366,m498,IKE,"And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back."
248261,L480141,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,And the church.
248262,L480140,u7366,m498,IKE,"Well, you do have the dress."
248263,L480139,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes, you!"
248264,L480138,u7366,m498,IKE,Me?
248265,L480137,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,To who?  Are you asking me?
248266,L480135,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I love you, too."
248267,L480134,u7366,m498,IKE,I love you.  I love you.
248268,L480133,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Me, either."
248269,L480132,u7366,m498,IKE,"I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it."
248270,L480131,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?"
248271,L480124,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Really?
248272,L480123,u7366,m498,IKE,A little longer for me.
248273,L480122,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,About a minute...?
248274,L480120,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I kissed him back.
248275,L480119,u7366,m498,IKE,"I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back."
248276,L480100,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey."
248277,L480099,u7366,m498,IKE,I'd rather not.
248278,L480098,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor."
248279,L480089,u7366,m498,IKE,No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
248280,L480088,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Yes I do!
248281,L480087,u7366,m498,IKE,"No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma."
248282,L480086,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,That's called changing your mind.
248283,L480085,u7366,m498,IKE,"With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much."
248284,L480084,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What!?
248285,L480083,u7366,m498,IKE,That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
248286,L480082,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Lost!
248287,L480081,u7366,m498,IKE,Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
248288,L480080,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
248289,L480079,u7366,m498,IKE,Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
248290,L480078,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Brian told you that?
248291,L480077,u7366,m498,IKE,And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
248292,L480076,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I already explained about that.
248293,L480075,u7366,m498,IKE,What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
248294,L480074,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,That was very interesting research George was doing!
248295,L480073,u7366,m498,IKE,Or the sexual habits of locusts?
248296,L480072,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,It's fun!  It's high.
248297,L480071,u7366,m498,IKE,"Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again."
248298,L480070,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
248299,L480069,u7366,m498,IKE,"No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party."
248300,L480068,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,You humiliated me!
248301,L480067,u7366,m498,IKE,I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
248302,L480057,u7366,m498,IKE,I don't and I don't think you should...
248303,L480056,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Yes.
248304,L480055,u7366,m498,IKE,Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
248305,L480054,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Excuse me?
248306,L480053,u7366,m498,IKE,"I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?"
248307,L480044,u7366,m498,IKE,"Missed me bad, huh?"
248308,L480043,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Where did you disappear to?
248309,L479979,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
248310,L479978,u7366,m498,IKE,"No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting."
248311,L479973,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
248312,L479972,u7366,m498,IKE,Kind of isolated.
248313,L479971,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
248314,L479970,u7366,m498,IKE,Of what?
248315,L479969,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
248316,L479968,u7366,m498,IKE,Can you fix it?
248317,L479967,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
248318,L479962,u7366,m498,IKE,Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
248319,L479961,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this."
248320,L479952,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
248321,L479951,u7366,m498,IKE,"Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?"
248322,L479950,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,No.  You take it.
248323,L479949,u7366,m498,IKE,It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
248324,L479948,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
248325,L479947,u7366,m498,IKE,"Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is ""King of Blue""!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?"
248326,L479940,u7366,m498,IKE,Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
248327,L479939,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Ike... Hi, Grandma."
248328,L479935,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You know, there's no..."
248329,L479934,u7366,m498,IKE,"Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?"
248330,L479930,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
248331,L479929,u7366,m498,IKE,Of course.
248332,L479928,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I'll have the same.
248333,L479923,u7366,m498,IKE,Bob will be very happy.
248334,L479922,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
248335,L479921,u7366,m498,IKE,You look... uh... You look fine.
248336,L479898,u7366,m498,IKE,Agreed.
248337,L479897,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
248338,L479893,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
248339,L479892,u7366,m498,IKE,No.
248340,L479891,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,You don't know.
248341,L479890,u7366,m498,IKE,I don't know.
248342,L479889,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
248343,L479888,u7366,m498,IKE,"No.  I think I said something eloquent like, ""So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"""
248344,L479887,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,So?  Is that what you said to her?
248345,L479886,u7366,m498,IKE,I'm a work in progress.
248346,L479884,u7366,m498,IKE,"Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true."
248347,L479883,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
248348,L479882,u7366,m498,IKE,Highly suspect.
248349,L479881,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
248350,L479879,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
248351,L479878,u7366,m498,IKE,"It's a little ""Silence of the Lambs"" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run."
248352,L479877,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Still sweet.
248353,L479876,u7366,m498,IKE,Always a mood killer.
248354,L479874,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
248355,L479873,u7366,m498,IKE,"Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room."
248356,L479872,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday."
248357,L479871,u7366,m498,IKE,You afraid to try?
248358,L479870,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Maybe someday.
248359,L479869,u7366,m498,IKE,I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
248360,L479868,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I think so.
248361,L479865,u7366,m498,IKE,Cindy the manicurist.
248362,L479864,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
248363,L479862,u7366,m498,IKE,Done.
248364,L479861,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Six-fifty.
248365,L479860,u7366,m498,IKE,Five hundred.
248366,L479859,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Seven-fifty.
248367,L479858,u7366,m498,IKE,Too much.
248368,L479857,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing."
248369,L479856,u7366,m498,IKE,You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
248370,L479855,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards."
248371,L479854,u7366,m498,IKE,My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
248372,L479852,u7366,m498,IKE,Really.
248373,L479851,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth."
248374,L479850,u7366,m498,IKE,I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
248375,L479849,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud."
248376,L479847,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
248377,L479846,u7366,m498,IKE,I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
248378,L479811,u7366,m498,IKE,"Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me."
248379,L479810,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
248380,L479809,u7366,m498,IKE,You can turn that finger around.
248381,L479808,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
248382,L479783,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,He is not!
248383,L479782,u7366,m498,IKE,"Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken."
248384,L479771,u7366,m498,IKE,But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
248385,L479770,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Give me that!
248386,L479701,u7366,m498,IKE,A pre-wedding luau?
248387,L479700,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
248388,L479684,u7366,m498,IKE,Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
248389,L479683,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,We think so.
248390,L479682,u7366,m498,IKE,How romantic.
248391,L479680,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Without oxygen...
248392,L479679,u7366,m498,IKE,Really?
248393,L479678,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Twice...
248394,L479677,u7366,m498,IKE,Everest.  Is that right?
248395,L479672,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again."
248396,L479671,u7366,m498,IKE,That's fair.
248397,L479642,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job."
248398,L479641,u7366,m498,IKE,We'll see.
248399,L479640,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,You're going to be very disappointed.
248400,L479639,u7366,m498,IKE,"Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to ""poor bastard number four"" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do."
248401,L479638,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Did something happen to make you care about reality?
248402,L479636,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,You have one?
248403,L479635,u7366,m498,IKE,I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
248404,L479620,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Yes.
248405,L479619,u7366,m498,IKE,Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
248406,L479618,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
248407,L479617,u7366,m498,IKE,Getting nervous?
248408,L479614,u7366,m498,IKE,You'll answer my questions?
248409,L479613,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it."
248410,L479601,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Excellent.
248411,L479600,u7366,m498,IKE,Originality is my speciality.
248412,L479599,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
248413,L480238,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Quick.  Very quick.
248414,L480237,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Thank you.  You still think that he was....
248415,L480236,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
248416,L480235,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,What are you talking about?
248417,L480234,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Okay.
248418,L480233,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No, I'm just going to head home."
248419,L480232,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
248420,L480231,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm just finishing up, too."
248421,L480230,u7370,m498,PEGGY,You okay?  I'm closing.
248422,L480210,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
248423,L480209,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Let's go.
248424,L480161,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Not eight...
248425,L480160,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
248426,L480159,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a ""V""."
248427,L480158,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
248428,L480153,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it."
248429,L480152,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Grandma!
248430,L480106,u7370,m498,PEGGY,It's for the bell.
248431,L480105,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
248432,L480104,u7370,m498,PEGGY,What happened at the luau?
248433,L480103,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
248434,L480102,u7370,m498,PEGGY,He's going to be the pastor?
248435,L480038,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Would it?
248436,L480037,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
248437,L480036,u7370,m498,PEGGY,This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
248438,L480035,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Lighten up, what?"
248439,L480034,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"Lighten up, wahine."
248440,L479844,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
248441,L479843,u7370,m498,PEGGY,You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
248442,L479842,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
248443,L479841,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
248444,L479840,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
248445,L479839,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one."
248446,L479838,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness."
248447,L479837,u7370,m498,PEGGY,No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
248448,L479836,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,But I'm weird.
248449,L479835,u7370,m498,PEGGY,No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
248450,L479834,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
248451,L479833,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"No, I don't think you're like, ""I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you"".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery."
248452,L479832,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Because you think I'm all like... ""Hey man, check me out""."
248453,L479831,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Why?
248454,L479830,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,I'm going to kill myself.
248455,L479828,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
248456,L479827,u7370,m498,PEGGY,I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
248457,L479825,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Yes.
248458,L479824,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
248459,L479823,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"Good morning to you, too.  You look good."
248460,L479795,u7370,m498,PEGGY,He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
248461,L479794,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those ""sources say"" things."
248462,L479793,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Where?
248463,L479792,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
248464,L479791,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
248465,L479790,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Ya think?
248466,L479789,u7370,m498,PEGGY,It's probably because you got him fired.
248467,L479788,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot."
248468,L479787,u7370,m498,PEGGY,For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
248469,L479786,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me."
248470,L479603,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,She's the boss.
248471,L479602,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
248472,L479598,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Yup!
248473,L479597,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Reporter?
248474,L479582,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me."
248475,L479581,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid."
248476,L479580,u7370,m498,PEGGY,You're a goddess!
248477,L479523,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!"
248478,L479522,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?"
248479,L480255,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room."
248480,L480254,u7371,m498,WALTER,A harmless joke.
248481,L480253,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,No.  It's my life.
248482,L480252,u7371,m498,WALTER,"Maggie, it's just a joke..."
248483,L480251,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
248484,L480250,u7371,m498,WALTER,What?
248485,L480207,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Thank you, Dad."
248486,L480206,u7371,m498,WALTER,I'm really rooting for this one.
248487,L479958,u7371,m498,WALTER,"I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own."
248488,L479957,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady."
248489,L479956,u7371,m498,WALTER,"Good boy, Port Hole."
248490,L479955,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady."
248491,L479670,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,Not this one.  This one's on me.
248492,L479669,u7371,m498,WALTER,"So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings."
248493,L479516,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
248494,L479515,u7370,m498,PEGGY,Yeah.
248495,L479514,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,"You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet."
248496,L479513,u7370,m498,PEGGY,No.
248497,L479512,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,"No, no.  You're her best friend."
248498,L479511,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"No, you tell her."
248499,L479510,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,You tell Maggie.
248500,L479509,u7368,m498,MRS. PRESSMAN,"""And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground""  Holy moly."
248501,L479508,u7370,m498,PEGGY,"""What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar.""... I can't ready anymore."
248502,L480305,u7385,m499,SETH,So you're angry.  Big deal.
248503,L480304,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time."
248504,L480303,u7385,m499,SETH,What am I going to do with a microwave?
248505,L480302,u7372,m499,ANNIE,You take the microwave?
248506,L480299,u7385,m499,SETH,That's good.
248507,L480298,u7372,m499,ANNIE,How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
248508,L480297,u7385,m499,SETH,Nope.
248509,L480296,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You don't love me, is that it?"
248510,L480295,u7385,m499,SETH,Nope.
248511,L480294,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Is there somebody else?
248512,L480293,u7385,m499,SETH,"There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was."
248513,L480853,u7390,m499,WHEEDLE,"No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living."
248514,L480852,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
248515,L480851,u7390,m499,WHEEDLE,It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
248516,L480850,u7372,m499,ANNIE,But it's on the water.
248517,L480849,u7390,m499,WHEEDLE,It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
248518,L480848,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind."
248519,L480847,u7390,m499,WHEEDLE,Houseboats don't go anywhere.
248520,L480846,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
248521,L480845,u7390,m499,WHEEDLE,It sounds nice.
248522,L480844,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I hate boats.
248523,L480843,u7390,m499,WHEEDLE,He's got a houseboat.
248524,L480842,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home."
248525,L481180,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Look!
248526,L481179,u7389,m499,WALTER,What?
248527,L481178,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Oh!
248528,L481177,u7389,m499,WALTER,Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
248529,L481176,u7372,m499,ANNIE,You okay?
248530,L481175,u7389,m499,WALTER,I think that's what I'm saying.
248531,L481174,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you."
248532,L481173,u7389,m499,WALTER,"Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?"
248533,L481172,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
248534,L481171,u7389,m499,WALTER,At the top of the Empire State Building --
248535,L481170,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I told you.  Nothing --
248536,L481169,u7389,m499,WALTER,So what happened?
248537,L481168,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
248538,L481167,u7389,m499,WALTER,-- it was a betrayal.
248539,L481166,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --"
248540,L481148,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Walter, there's something I have to tell you --"
248541,L481147,u7389,m499,WALTER,"Beautiful view, isn't it?"
248542,L481088,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated."
248543,L481087,u7389,m499,WALTER,It was my mother's.
248544,L481086,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Walter.
248545,L481082,u7389,m499,WALTER,It's just like my grandmother's china.
248546,L481081,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I do.
248547,L481080,u7389,m499,WALTER,You couldn't.
248548,L481079,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
248549,L481075,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect."
248550,L481074,u7389,m499,WALTER,No.
248551,L481073,u7372,m499,ANNIE,About forever.
248552,L481072,u7389,m499,WALTER,What?
248553,L481071,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?"
248554,L481070,u7389,m499,WALTER,"Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were."
248555,L481069,u7372,m499,ANNIE,You go.
248556,L480937,u7389,m499,WALTER,"Okay, okay."
248557,L480936,u7372,m499,ANNIE,And then I'll see you in New York --
248558,L480935,u7389,m499,WALTER,"When you get back, I'll be gone --"
248559,L480934,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
248560,L480933,u7389,m499,WALTER,Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
248561,L480913,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
248562,L480912,u7389,m499,WALTER,That doesn't make any sense.
248563,L480911,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth."
248564,L480903,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again."
248565,L480902,u7389,m499,WALTER,Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
248566,L480886,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs."
248567,L480885,u7389,m499,WALTER,Who is it?
248568,L480642,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I don't think so.
248569,L480641,u7389,m499,WALTER,Does it have wheat in it?
248570,L480640,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's delicious, trust me."
248571,L480639,u7389,m499,WALTER,What is it?
248572,L480638,u7372,m499,ANNIE,We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
248573,L480637,u7389,m499,WALTER,Go to the Symphony --
248574,L480636,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Go for a walk in Central Park --
248575,L480635,u7389,m499,WALTER,We'll stay at the Plaza --
248576,L480634,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Walter, I'd love to --"
248577,L480633,u7389,m499,WALTER,"I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?"
248578,L480632,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Happy New Year.
248579,L480631,u7389,m499,WALTER,"Happy New Year, darling."
248580,L480426,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
248581,L480425,u7389,m499,WALTER,I'll wait.
248582,L480424,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident."
248583,L480423,u7389,m499,WALTER,You sure you don't want to drive with me?
248584,L480422,u7389,m499,WALTER,Nope.  Not even when I was young.
248585,L480421,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Even when you were young?
248586,L480420,u7389,m499,WALTER,Nope.
248587,L480419,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?"
248588,L480418,u7389,m499,WALTER,I love you.
248589,L480417,u7372,m499,ANNIE,They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
248590,L480383,u7389,m499,WALTER,Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
248591,L480382,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Is that all right with you?
248592,L480364,u7389,m499,WALTER,My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
248593,L480363,u7372,m499,ANNIE,If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
248594,L480360,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --"
248595,L480359,u7389,m499,WALTER,Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
248596,L480347,u7372,m499,ANNIE,They're going to love you.
248597,L480346,u7389,m499,WALTER,Am I what they had in mind?
248598,L480345,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
248599,L480344,u7389,m499,WALTER,"Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --"
248600,L480343,u7372,m499,ANNIE,-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
248601,L480342,u7389,m499,WALTER,And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
248602,L480341,u7372,m499,ANNIE,-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
248603,L480340,u7389,m499,WALTER,"Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --"
248604,L480339,u7372,m499,ANNIE,-- who's married to --
248605,L480338,u7389,m499,WALTER,The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
248606,L481052,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is history."
248607,L481051,u7374,m499,BECKY,I love the symphony.
248608,L481050,u7372,m499,ANNIE,We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
248609,L481049,u7374,m499,BECKY,What are your plans in New York?
248610,L481048,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No, I'm not."
248611,L481047,u7374,m499,BECKY,You're going to miss the train.
248612,L481015,u7372,m499,ANNIE,It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
248613,L481014,u7374,m499,BECKY,What about the letter?
248614,L481013,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me."
248615,L481012,u7374,m499,BECKY,"So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble."
248616,L481010,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Made for each other.
248617,L481009,u7374,m499,BECKY,M.F.E.O.?
248618,L481008,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."""
248619,L481007,u7374,m499,BECKY,So I mailed your letter.
248620,L481006,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Becky?
248621,L481005,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle."
248622,L481004,u7374,m499,BECKY,This is a photo of hair.
248623,L481003,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I saw her.  She looked just like this --
248624,L481002,u7374,m499,BECKY,"You don't know who she was, Annie --"
248625,L481001,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk."
248626,L481000,u7374,m499,BECKY,It's a sign --
248627,L480996,u7372,m499,ANNIE,He said hello.
248628,L480995,u7374,m499,BECKY,"But he saw you, right?"
248629,L480994,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing."
248630,L480993,u7374,m499,BECKY,I love that dream.
248631,L480992,u7372,m499,ANNIE,You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
248632,L480991,u7374,m499,BECKY,You were standing in the middle of the street?
248633,L480984,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Good night.
248634,L480983,u7374,m499,BECKY,"I love you, too."
248635,L480982,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Thank you.  I love you.
248636,L480981,u7374,m499,BECKY,No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
248637,L480980,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Is this crazy?
248638,L480979,u7374,m499,BECKY,What?
248639,L480978,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Becky?
248640,L480977,u7374,m499,BECKY,Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
248641,L480976,u7372,m499,ANNIE,That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
248642,L480975,u7374,m499,BECKY,You told a lie and got on a plane.
248643,L480974,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
248644,L480973,u7374,m499,BECKY,Did you talk to him?
248645,L480921,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Definitely.
248646,L480920,u7374,m499,BECKY,You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
248647,L480919,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
248648,L480884,u7374,m499,BECKY,"The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on."
248649,L480883,u7372,m499,ANNIE,What?
248650,L480882,u7374,m499,BECKY,Turn on your radio!
248651,L480881,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Hello.
248652,L480764,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I always wondered about that too.
248653,L480763,u7374,m499,BECKY,Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
248654,L480762,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I know.
248655,L480761,u7374,m499,BECKY,Men never get this movie.
248656,L480760,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Listen to this, I love this part --"
248657,L480759,u7374,m499,BECKY,Plus he fell in love with a temp.
248658,L480758,u7372,m499,ANNIE,And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
248659,L480757,u7374,m499,BECKY,Yes.
248660,L480756,u7372,m499,ANNIE,No.
248661,L480755,u7374,m499,BECKY,Can too.
248662,L480754,u7372,m499,ANNIE,That's impossible.  A guy can't --
248663,L480753,u7374,m499,BECKY,He lost all the weight... there.
248664,L480752,u7372,m499,ANNIE,You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
248665,L480751,u7374,m499,BECKY,"You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says ""vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied"" --"
248666,L480750,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in."
248667,L480749,u7374,m499,BECKY,"""On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."""
248668,L480748,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""I want to meet you..."""
248669,L480747,u7374,m499,BECKY,Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
248670,L480746,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?"
248671,L480745,u7374,m499,BECKY,What?
248672,L480744,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I should say something in this about magic.
248673,L480743,u7374,m499,BECKY,Right.
248674,L480742,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
248675,L480741,u7374,m499,BECKY,You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
248676,L480740,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know that.  You think I don't know that? ""I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."""
248677,L480739,u7374,m499,BECKY,And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
248678,L480738,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows"" --"
248679,L480737,u7374,m499,BECKY,It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
248680,L480736,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""Dear Sleepless and Son..."""
248681,L480735,u7374,m499,BECKY,... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
248682,L480734,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was..."
248683,L480733,u7374,m499,BECKY,You're a basket case.
248684,L480588,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Not.
248685,L480587,u7374,m499,BECKY,"Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it."
248686,L480586,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Actually, he sounded nice."
248687,L480585,u7374,m499,BECKY,"And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick."
248688,L480584,u7372,m499,ANNIE,That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
248689,L480583,u7374,m499,BECKY,"""Sleepless in Seattle""?"
248690,L480582,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Nothing's with me.
248691,L480581,u7374,m499,BECKY,What's with you?
248692,L480580,u7372,m499,ANNIE,What was what?
248693,L480579,u7374,m499,BECKY,What was that about up there?
248694,L480571,u7372,m499,ANNIE,There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
248695,L480570,u7374,m499,BECKY,"It's not true, but it feels true."
248696,L480565,u7374,m499,BECKY,Whatever it is.
248697,L480564,u7372,m499,ANNIE,About what?
248698,L480563,u7374,m499,BECKY,You should write something about this.
248699,L480798,u7376,m499,DET. WHEEDLE,You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
248700,L480797,u7372,m499,ANNIE,No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
248701,L480796,u7376,m499,DET. WHEEDLE,Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
248702,L480795,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him."
248703,L480794,u7376,m499,DET. WHEEDLE,A sense of humor.
248704,L480793,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --"
248705,L480792,u7376,m499,DET. WHEEDLE,"So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --"
248706,L480791,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No, I know that part --"
248707,L480790,u7376,m499,DET. WHEEDLE,"Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--"
248708,L480789,u7372,m499,ANNIE,She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
248709,L480788,u7376,m499,DET. WHEEDLE,Okay.
248710,L480787,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
248711,L480320,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?"
248712,L480319,u7382,m499,LAURIE,Go home for the weekend.
248713,L480318,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I want my money.
248714,L480317,u7382,m499,LAURIE,Maybe you should see a shrink.
248715,L480316,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I know.
248716,L480315,u7382,m499,LAURIE,"He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was."
248717,L480314,u7372,m499,ANNIE,I know.
248718,L480313,u7382,m499,LAURIE,"Honey, he wasn't right for you."
248719,L481212,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Howard.
248720,L481211,u7381,m499,JONAH,Howard.
248721,L481210,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?"
248722,L481209,u7381,m499,JONAH,I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
248723,L481206,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Yes.
248724,L481205,u7381,m499,JONAH,Are you Annie?
248725,L480898,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Come on, Jonah --"
248726,L480897,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this."
248727,L480888,u7372,m499,ANNIE,How am I going to explain this to Walter?
248728,L480887,u7381,m499,JONAH,"This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --"
248729,L480477,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --"
248730,L480476,u7381,m499,JONAH,Please --
248731,L480453,u7381,m499,JONAH,And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
248732,L480452,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
248733,L480700,u7387,m499,TOM,Any time.
248734,L480699,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off."
248735,L480698,u7387,m499,TOM,"Yes, I did."
248736,L480697,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?"
248737,L480696,u7387,m499,TOM,It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
248738,L480695,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle."
248739,L480694,u7387,m499,TOM,"Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match."
248740,L480693,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?"
248741,L480692,u7387,m499,TOM,I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
248742,L480691,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --"
248743,L480690,u7387,m499,TOM,What?
248744,L480689,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?"
248745,L480416,u7373,m499,BARBARA,You don't believe in signs.
248746,L480415,u7372,m499,ANNIE,It's a sign.
248747,L480414,u7373,m499,BARBARA,So you'll get married in a new dress.
248748,L480413,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Like... clockwork.
248749,L480412,u7373,m499,BARBARA,"Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?"
248750,L480411,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Mom, we already..."
248751,L480410,u7373,m499,BARBARA,"Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --"
248752,L480409,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Mom!
248753,L480408,u7373,m499,BARBARA,"I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --"
248754,L480407,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Magic.
248755,L480406,u7373,m499,BARBARA,Magic.  It was magic.
248756,L480405,u7372,m499,ANNIE,What?
248757,L480404,u7373,m499,BARBARA,You know.
248758,L480403,u7372,m499,ANNIE,What?
248759,L480402,u7373,m499,BARBARA,"I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew."
248760,L480401,u7372,m499,ANNIE,It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
248761,L480400,u7373,m499,BARBARA,Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
248762,L480399,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental."
248763,L480398,u7373,m499,BARBARA,Destiny takes a hand.
248764,L480397,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life."
248765,L480396,u7373,m499,BARBARA,How amazing.
248766,L480395,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white."
248767,L480394,u7373,m499,BARBARA,How did it happen?
248768,L480393,u7372,m499,ANNIE,You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
248769,L480392,u7373,m499,BARBARA,Are his folks nice?
248770,L480391,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?"
248771,L480390,u7373,m499,BARBARA,"I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie."
248772,L480389,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom."
248773,L480388,u7373,m499,BARBARA,The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
248774,L480358,u7373,m499,BARBARA,We'll move them --
248775,L480357,u7372,m499,ANNIE,It's probably just the flowers --
248776,L480349,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Walter and I are engaged!
248777,L480348,u7373,m499,BARBARA,Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
248778,L481204,u7384,m499,SAM,The one in the street.  I chased after you.
248779,L481203,u7372,m499,ANNIE,It's me?
248780,L481202,u7384,m499,SAM,It's you.
248781,L481046,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Shhhh --
248782,L481045,u7384,m499,SAM,"Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?"
248783,L481044,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Hi.
248784,L480989,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Hello.
248785,L480988,u7384,m499,SAM,Hello.
248786,L480524,u7384,m499,SAM,Magic.
248787,L480523,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Magic.
248788,L480522,u7384,m499,SAM,"You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like..."
248789,L480487,u7384,m499,SAM,Sure you do --
248790,L480486,u7372,m499,ANNIE,Sure you do.
248791,L480609,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone."
248792,L480608,u7375,m499,BOB,"Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened."
248793,L480599,u7384,m499,SAM,Why me? What about Jay?
248794,L480598,u7375,m499,BOB,"The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets."
248795,L480597,u7384,m499,SAM,Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
248796,L480596,u7375,m499,BOB,Grace heard it.
248797,L480595,u7384,m499,SAM,"Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?"
248798,L480592,u7384,m499,SAM,The cabinets have to be redone --
248799,L480591,u7375,m499,BOB,Which means --
248800,L480521,u7384,m499,SAM,"And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling."
248801,L480520,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Why not?
248802,L480519,u7384,m499,SAM,I don't think I could really describe it.
248803,L480518,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,What was it that made you know?
248804,L480517,u7384,m499,SAM,"I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>."
248805,L480516,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,"What are you going to do, Sam?"
248806,L480515,u7384,m499,SAM,It's hard to imagine.
248807,L480514,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
248808,L480499,u7384,m499,SAM,What's she talking about?
248809,L480498,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,"We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is..."
248810,L480485,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,And I don't want to invade your privacy --
248811,L480484,u7384,m499,SAM,"Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --"
248812,L480483,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Why not?
248813,L480482,u7384,m499,SAM,No.
248814,L480481,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Have you had any relationship since?
248815,L480480,u7384,m499,SAM,It's been about a year and a half.
248816,L480479,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
248817,L480478,u7384,m499,SAM,All righ...
248818,L480475,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
248819,L480474,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you."
248820,L480471,u7384,m499,SAM,"Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --"
248821,L480470,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
248822,L480469,u7384,m499,SAM,Who is this?
248823,L480468,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
248824,L480467,u7384,m499,SAM,I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
248825,L480466,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,"Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America."
248826,L480465,u7384,m499,SAM,Hello.
248827,L480490,u7381,m499,JONAH,Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
248828,L480489,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
248829,L480460,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Fair enough.
248830,L480459,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again."
248831,L480458,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
248832,L480457,u7381,m499,JONAH,I don't know --
248833,L480456,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,"Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly."
248834,L480455,u7381,m499,JONAH,Yeah.
248835,L480454,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Is he home right now?
248836,L480451,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,You want me to talk to him?
248837,L480450,u7381,m499,JONAH,It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
248838,L480449,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Why not?
248839,L480448,u7381,m499,JONAH,No.
248840,L480445,u7381,m499,JONAH,"I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas."
248841,L480444,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,And you're worried about him.
248842,L480443,u7381,m499,JONAH,"I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse."
248843,L480442,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,"I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah."
248844,L480440,u7381,m499,JONAH,She died.
248845,L480439,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,Where's your mom?
248846,L480438,u7381,m499,JONAH,He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
248847,L480437,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,You don't like the one he was now?
248848,L480436,u7381,m499,JONAH,It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
248849,L480435,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,"Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?"
248850,L480434,u7381,m499,JONAH,It's not that late in Seattle.
248851,L480433,u7377,m499,DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE,"No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?"
248852,L481040,u7378,m499,GREG,"Right, right."
248853,L481039,u7386,m499,SUZY,It is not --
248854,L481038,u7378,m499,GREG,It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
248855,L481037,u7386,m499,SUZY,No.
248856,L481036,u7378,m499,GREG,How about rapacious and love- starved?
248857,L481035,u7386,m499,SUZY,Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
248858,L481032,u7378,m499,GREG,What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
248859,L481031,u7386,m499,SUZY,"They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind."
248860,L480717,u7384,m499,SAM,This is going to be tougher than I thought.
248861,L480716,u7379,m499,JAY,You'll like it.
248862,L480715,u7384,m499,SAM,Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
248863,L480714,u7379,m499,JAY,You'll see.
248864,L480713,u7384,m499,SAM,What is it?
248865,L480712,u7379,m499,JAY,You'll find out.
248866,L480711,u7384,m499,SAM,What's tira misu?
248867,L480710,u7379,m499,JAY,Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
248868,L480709,u7384,m499,SAM,I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
248869,L480708,u7379,m499,JAY,"Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check."
248870,L480707,u7384,m499,SAM,Seventy... eight.
248871,L480706,u7379,m499,JAY,When's the latest time you were out there?
248872,L480705,u7379,m499,JAY,"Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on."
248873,L480704,u7384,m499,SAM,"You mean, like, ""He has the cutest butt""? Where did I hear that recently?"
248874,L480703,u7379,m499,JAY,"And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt."
248875,L480702,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there."
248876,L480701,u7379,m499,JAY,"Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --"
248877,L480601,u7384,m499,SAM,"Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction."
248878,L480600,u7379,m499,JAY,"Hey, my plate is full."
248879,L481067,u7380,m499,JESSICA,I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
248880,L481066,u7381,m499,JONAH,I don't know.  Do I?
248881,L481065,u7380,m499,JESSICA,Do you want a fruit plate?
248882,L481064,u7381,m499,JONAH,Window.
248883,L481063,u7380,m499,JESSICA,Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
248884,L481060,u7381,m499,JONAH,But how am I going to get there?
248885,L481059,u7380,m499,JESSICA,"I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think."
248886,L481058,u7381,m499,JONAH,Eighty dollars.
248887,L481057,u7380,m499,JESSICA,Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
248888,L481056,u7381,m499,JONAH,Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
248889,L481055,u7380,m499,JESSICA,"You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her."
248890,L481054,u7381,m499,JONAH,I don't get it.
248891,L481053,u7380,m499,JESSICA,This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
248892,L480918,u7380,m499,JESSICA,Your only hope.
248893,L480917,u7381,m499,JONAH,Yeah.  What's that?
248894,L480916,u7380,m499,JESSICA,It's Y. O. H.
248895,L480915,u7381,m499,JONAH,You think so?
248896,L480914,u7380,m499,JESSICA,Write her.
248897,L480728,u7380,m499,JESSICA,H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
248898,L480727,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Dad, could you close the door?"
248899,L481189,u7381,m499,JONAH,Sure.
248900,L481188,u7384,m499,SAM,"What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?"
248901,L481187,u7381,m499,JONAH,Okay.
248902,L481186,u7384,m499,SAM,Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
248903,L481165,u7381,m499,JONAH,It was all they had.
248904,L481164,u7384,m499,SAM,I can't believe you flew first class.
248905,L481163,u7381,m499,JONAH,No.
248906,L481162,u7384,m499,SAM,"I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?"
248907,L481161,u7381,m499,JONAH,No.
248908,L481160,u7384,m499,SAM,"Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?"
248909,L481159,u7381,m499,JONAH,If I didn't go.
248910,L481158,u7384,m499,SAM,When I found you?
248911,L481157,u7381,m499,JONAH,I was scared of what you were gonna do.
248912,L481156,u7384,m499,SAM,What if I couldn't get to you?
248913,L481111,u7384,m499,SAM,"Goddammit, I am sick of this --"
248914,L481110,u7381,m499,JONAH,No.
248915,L481109,u7384,m499,SAM,Get out.
248916,L481108,u7381,m499,JONAH,I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
248917,L481107,u7384,m499,SAM,"I can't know what I said, but we're not going."
248918,L481106,u7381,m499,JONAH,Did too.
248919,L481105,u7384,m499,SAM,Did not.
248920,L481104,u7381,m499,JONAH,You said we could go to New York.
248921,L481103,u7384,m499,SAM,This conversation is finished.
248922,L481102,u7381,m499,JONAH,Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
248923,L481101,u7384,m499,SAM,Shut up.
248924,L481100,u7381,m499,JONAH,What's wrong with Annie?
248925,L481099,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission."
248926,L481098,u7381,m499,JONAH,Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
248927,L481096,u7381,m499,JONAH,This is the one I like.
248928,L481095,u7384,m499,SAM,I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
248929,L481094,u7384,m499,SAM,Yes.
248930,L481093,u7381,m499,JONAH,Are you going with her?
248931,L481092,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know."
248932,L481091,u7381,m499,JONAH,It might be in the kitchen.
248933,L481090,u7384,m499,SAM,Have you seen my wallet?
248934,L480963,u7384,m499,SAM,I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
248935,L480962,u7381,m499,JONAH,The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
248936,L480959,u7381,m499,JONAH,The one who wrote us.
248937,L480958,u7384,m499,SAM,Who is Annie?
248938,L480957,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life."
248939,L480956,u7381,m499,JONAH,Victoria? She's okay.
248940,L480955,u7384,m499,SAM,"God, she's beautiful."
248941,L480953,u7384,m499,SAM,I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
248942,L480952,u7381,m499,JONAH,Was Mom an adjustment?
248943,L480951,u7384,m499,SAM,"Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment."
248944,L480931,u7381,m499,JONAH,"If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you."
248945,L480930,u7384,m499,SAM,This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
248946,L480929,u7381,m499,JONAH,It's a short word.
248947,L480928,u7384,m499,SAM,Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
248948,L480927,u7381,m499,JONAH,I just called for a second.
248949,L480926,u7384,m499,SAM,Everyone at work heard you.
248950,L480925,u7381,m499,JONAH,No.
248951,L480924,u7384,m499,SAM,Did you call that radio station again?
248952,L480910,u7384,m499,SAM,That's true.  Why is that?
248953,L480909,u7381,m499,JONAH,The water tastes better in the kitchen.
248954,L480908,u7384,m499,SAM,There's a bathroom upstairs.
248955,L480907,u7381,m499,JONAH,I was thirsty.
248956,L480906,u7384,m499,SAM,What are you doing up?
248957,L480905,u7381,m499,JONAH,I thought I saw a black widow spider.
248958,L480904,u7384,m499,SAM,Don't ever do that again.
248959,L480880,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah."
248960,L480879,u7381,m499,JONAH,Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
248961,L480878,u7384,m499,SAM,Thank Victoria for dinner.
248962,L480877,u7381,m499,JONAH,Okay.
248963,L480876,u7384,m499,SAM,Jonah!
248964,L480875,u7381,m499,JONAH,It's only ten o'clock.
248965,L480874,u7384,m499,SAM,"Okay, tiger.  Time for bed."
248966,L480858,u7384,m499,SAM,She's going to cook something for us?
248967,L480857,u7381,m499,JONAH,Why is she bringing that bag?
248968,L480856,u7384,m499,SAM,There she is.
248969,L480855,u7381,m499,JONAH,"I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --"
248970,L480827,u7384,m499,SAM,Perfect.  We'll be there.
248971,L480826,u7381,m499,JONAH,She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
248972,L480825,u7384,m499,SAM,Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed.
248973,L480823,u7384,m499,SAM,"Oh, right."
248974,L480822,u7381,m499,JONAH,It's a sign.
248975,L480821,u7384,m499,SAM,Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
248976,L480820,u7381,m499,JONAH,Dad!
248977,L480819,u7381,m499,JONAH,"WAIT!!!  -- ""and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore.""  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest."
248978,L480818,u7384,m499,SAM,"Jonah, I'm leaving --"
248979,L480817,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Just this one part, okay?  ""I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"""
248980,L480816,u7384,m499,SAM,"Not now, Jonah --"
248981,L480815,u7381,m499,JONAH,Listen to this --
248982,L480814,u7384,m499,SAM,Now I'm late.  Bye.
248983,L480813,u7381,m499,JONAH,Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
248984,L480812,u7384,m499,SAM,The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
248985,L480811,u7381,m499,JONAH,"This is a good letter, Dad."
248986,L480810,u7384,m499,SAM,"I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut."
248987,L480809,u7381,m499,JONAH,Great.
248988,L480805,u7381,m499,JONAH,Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
248989,L480804,u7384,m499,SAM,This one's for both of us.
248990,L480779,u7381,m499,JONAH,Good.
248991,L480778,u7384,m499,SAM,I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
248992,L480777,u7384,m499,SAM,"I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom."
248993,L480776,u7381,m499,JONAH,I'm starting to forget her.
248994,L480775,u7384,m499,SAM,"I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?"
248995,L480774,u7381,m499,JONAH,Like do you believe in heaven?
248996,L480773,u7384,m499,SAM,I don't know.
248997,L480772,u7381,m499,JONAH,I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
248998,L480771,u7384,m499,SAM,Is that what she used to sing?
248999,L480770,u7381,m499,JONAH,Bye bye blackbird.
249000,L480769,u7384,m499,SAM,You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
249001,L480768,u7381,m499,JONAH,Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
249002,L480767,u7384,m499,SAM,What was?
249003,L480766,u7381,m499,JONAH,It was sinking.
249004,L480726,u7381,m499,JONAH,How do you know?
249005,L480725,u7384,m499,SAM,I know.
249006,L480724,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says ""Paul is dead."""
249007,L480723,u7384,m499,SAM,"It's nice to meet you, Jessica."
249008,L480722,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica."
249009,L480676,u7384,m499,SAM,Go to sleep.
249010,L480675,u7381,m499,JONAH,Jed's got cables.
249011,L480674,u7384,m499,SAM,Whose show was this on?
249012,L480673,u7381,m499,JONAH,In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
249013,L480672,u7384,m499,SAM,What?
249014,L480671,u7381,m499,JONAH,Will she scratch up your back?
249015,L480670,u7384,m499,SAM,What do you think?
249016,L480669,u7381,m499,JONAH,"If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?"
249017,L480668,u7384,m499,SAM,I'm starting to notice that.
249018,L480667,u7381,m499,JONAH,It doesn't.  They ask you.
249019,L480666,u7384,m499,SAM,"But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way."
249020,L480665,u7381,m499,JONAH,-- a slice of pizza --
249021,L480664,u7384,m499,SAM,"You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --"
249022,L480663,u7381,m499,JONAH,English muffin.  How do you do it?
249023,L480662,u7384,m499,SAM,This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
249024,L480661,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Dad, you're not taking this seriously."
249025,L480660,u7384,m499,SAM,She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
249026,L480659,u7381,m499,JONAH,She's willing to fly anywhere.
249027,L480658,u7384,m499,SAM,I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
249028,L480657,u7381,m499,JONAH,Somewhere in the middle.
249029,L480656,u7384,m499,SAM,Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
249030,L480655,u7381,m499,JONAH,"This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  ""Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa."" Where is that? --"
249031,L480654,u7384,m499,SAM,Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
249032,L480653,u7381,m499,JONAH,"""Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF""--  What is that?"
249033,L480652,u7381,m499,JONAH,You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
249034,L480651,u7384,m499,SAM,How did they get our phone number?
249035,L480650,u7381,m499,JONAH,"They called and asked for it.  ""Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."""
249036,L480649,u7384,m499,SAM,"Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?"
249037,L480626,u7384,m499,SAM,"Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry."
249038,L480625,u7381,m499,JONAH,Stressed.
249039,L480624,u7384,m499,SAM,I'm sorry.  I'm just --
249040,L480621,u7384,m499,SAM,I think I know how to have a spice rack.
249041,L480620,u7381,m499,JONAH,Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
249042,L480619,u7384,m499,SAM,Sure.  Looking good.
249043,L480618,u7381,m499,JONAH,So I can go.
249044,L480617,u7384,m499,SAM,Fine.  Fine.
249045,L480616,u7381,m499,JONAH,Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
249046,L480615,u7384,m499,SAM,"Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?"
249047,L480614,u7381,m499,JONAH,I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
249048,L480613,u7384,m499,SAM,What?
249049,L480612,u7381,m499,JONAH,P.  Dad?
249050,L480611,u7384,m499,SAM,Does red pepper go under R or P?
249051,L480606,u7381,m499,JONAH,Dad --
249052,L480605,u7384,m499,SAM,What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
249053,L480604,u7381,m499,JONAH,"No, I'm not, but --"
249054,L480603,u7384,m499,SAM,"Oh, you're changing your mind --"
249055,L480602,u7381,m499,JONAH,"Dad, I don't know about this one --"
249056,L480554,u7384,m499,SAM,You're right.  You better hope so.
249057,L480553,u7381,m499,JONAH,Nobody else is going to know it was us.
249058,L480552,u7384,m499,SAM,What?!
249059,L480551,u7381,m499,JONAH,It plays in 50 states.
249060,L480550,u7384,m499,SAM,How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
249061,L480549,u7384,m499,SAM,My feelings exactly.
249062,L480548,u7381,m499,JONAH,Not.
249063,L480538,u7381,m499,JONAH,Right.
249064,L480537,u7384,m499,SAM,It's never happening again. Right?
249065,L480536,u7381,m499,JONAH,Dad?  About last night?
249066,L480534,u7384,m499,SAM,We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
249067,L480533,u7381,m499,JONAH,It's a spice rack.
249068,L480532,u7384,m499,SAM,"The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --"
249069,L480493,u7384,m499,SAM,I don't think I have to now.
249070,L480492,u7381,m499,JONAH,"I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad."
249071,L480463,u7381,m499,JONAH,There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
249072,L480462,u7384,m499,SAM,What is it?
249073,L480461,u7381,m499,JONAH,Dad --
249074,L480943,u7381,m499,JONAH,I think they're announcing your flight.
249075,L480942,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,Well...
249076,L480941,u7381,m499,JONAH,Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
249077,L480873,u7381,m499,JONAH,"We ought to start camping again, Dad."
249078,L480872,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
249079,L480871,u7381,m499,JONAH,Do you like it?
249080,L480870,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,What about it?
249081,L480869,u7381,m499,JONAH,What about camping?
249082,L480868,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,"Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?"
249083,L480867,u7381,m499,JONAH,Do you like baseball?
249084,L480860,u7381,m499,JONAH,Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
249085,L480859,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,"Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah."
249086,L480547,u7383,m499,LULU,"Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting."
249087,L480546,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thanks, but... we've got plans."
249088,L480545,u7383,m499,LULU,"We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by."
249089,L480543,u7383,m499,LULU,You must be Jonah.
249090,L480542,u7384,m499,SAM,Yes?
249091,L480541,u7383,m499,LULU,Hi.  Sam?
249092,L480540,u7384,m499,SAM,Hi.
249093,L481043,u7384,m499,SAM,"Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies."
249094,L481042,u7386,m499,SUZY,Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
249095,L481041,u7384,m499,SAM,"Anyway, Victoria's nice."
249096,L481029,u7386,m499,SUZY,"""An Affair To Remember."" Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called ""Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."""
249097,L481028,u7384,m499,SAM,What do you mean?
249098,L481027,u7386,m499,SUZY,It's a little derivative.
249099,L481023,u7384,m499,SAM,"Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing."
249100,L481022,u7386,m499,SUZY,You're kidding --
249101,L481021,u7384,m499,SAM,It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
249102,L481020,u7386,m499,SUZY,How's Jonah taking it?
249103,L481017,u7384,m499,SAM,I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
249104,L481016,u7386,m499,SUZY,You saw her in the airport and then here?
249105,L480986,u7386,m499,SUZY,He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
249106,L480985,u7384,m499,SAM,"God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?"
249107,L480324,u7386,m499,SUZY,I'm sorry --
249108,L480323,u7384,m499,SAM,"Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart."
249109,L480322,u7386,m499,SUZY,"Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone."
249110,L480301,u7384,m499,SAM,Microwave.  Five minutes.
249111,L480300,u7386,m499,SUZY,"Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?"
249112,L480950,u7384,m499,SAM,Sure.  Sure.
249113,L480949,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,"Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?"
249114,L480948,u7384,m499,SAM,It takes time --
249115,L480947,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,I read the same article...
249116,L480946,u7384,m499,SAM,I read an article about this ...
249117,L480945,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,He's good at it.
249118,L480944,u7384,m499,SAM,He's ten.
249119,L480896,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,Absolutely.  Right.
249120,L480895,u7384,m499,SAM,"No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway."
249121,L480894,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,Is he there?
249122,L480864,u7384,m499,SAM,I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
249123,L480863,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
249124,L480862,u7384,m499,SAM,"We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --"
249125,L480839,u7384,m499,SAM,"So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months."
249126,L480838,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,Oh.
249127,L480837,u7384,m499,SAM,You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
249128,L480836,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
249129,L480835,u7384,m499,SAM,You could have called me --
249130,L480834,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,"I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --"
249131,L480833,u7384,m499,SAM,You did?
249132,L480832,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,I thought you were never going to call me.
249133,L480831,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,You look good yourself.
249134,L480830,u7384,m499,SAM,You look good.
249135,L480829,u7388,m499,VICTORIA,Hi.
249136,L480828,u7384,m499,SAM,Hi.
249137,L481462,u7399,m500,RAMN,There's nothing stopping you.
249138,L481461,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
249139,L481460,u7399,m500,RAMN,No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
249140,L481459,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,"I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?"
249141,L481448,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,That's none of their affair.
249142,L481447,u7399,m500,RAMN,The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
249143,L481446,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,No thanks.
249144,L481445,u7399,m500,RAMN,You're welcome to one.
249145,L481444,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
249146,L481443,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?"
249147,L481362,u7399,m500,RAMN,Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
249148,L481361,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,Why didn't you give a warning signal?
249149,L481360,u7399,m500,RAMN,I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
249150,L481871,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,I don't make policy.
249151,L481870,u7403,m500,SHERIFF,Got any more ideas?
249152,L481698,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,"No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?"
249153,L481697,u7403,m500,SHERIFF,You want 'em all arrested?
249154,L481696,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,You haven't tried locking them up!
249155,L481695,u7403,m500,SHERIFF,I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
249156,L481694,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,Well?
249157,L481657,u7403,m500,SHERIFF,"Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail."
249158,L481656,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,Whose side are you on anyway?
249159,L481655,u7403,m500,SHERIFF,"Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners."
249160,L481431,u7403,m500,SHERIFF,"Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail."
249161,L481430,u7391,m500,ALEXANDER,How's it going?
249162,L481429,u7403,m500,SHERIFF,Mornin'.
249163,L481749,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
249164,L481748,u7399,m500,RAMN,What do you mean -- sex equality?
249165,L481747,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,"He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality."
249166,L481746,u7399,m500,RAMN,So? What does he want to do about 'em?
249167,L481745,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,"Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em."
249168,L481744,u7399,m500,RAMN,The woman question?
249169,L481743,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,"It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it."
249170,L481742,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,Yeah.
249171,L481741,u7399,m500,RAMN,Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
249172,L481740,u7399,m500,RAMN,It never ends.
249173,L481739,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,How goes it?
249174,L481591,u7399,m500,RAMN,You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
249175,L481590,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
249176,L481437,u7399,m500,RAMN,"No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?"
249177,L481436,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
249178,L481435,u7399,m500,RAMN,Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
249179,L481297,u7399,m500,RAMN,I say we gotta take action. Now.
249180,L481296,u7392,m500,ANTONIO,Take a drink. Calm down!
249181,L481365,u7393,m500,BARTON,"You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ..."
249182,L481364,u7399,m500,RAMN,You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
249183,L481363,u7393,m500,BARTON,I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
249184,L481259,u7393,m500,BARTON,An American.
249185,L481258,u7399,m500,RAMN,Who? A scab?
249186,L481257,u7393,m500,BARTON,"You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can."
249187,L481256,u7399,m500,RAMN,Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
249188,L481251,u7399,m500,RAMN,He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
249189,L481250,u7393,m500,BARTON,Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
249190,L481249,u7399,m500,RAMN,So much the better.
249191,L481248,u7393,m500,BARTON,Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
249192,L481247,u7399,m500,RAMN,"You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super."
249193,L481246,u7393,m500,BARTON,"Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?"
249194,L481319,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Yes. We will light the candles.
249195,L481318,u7395,m500,ESTELLA,Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
249196,L481317,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,They are singing for me.
249197,L481316,u7395,m500,ESTELLA,"Why are they singing, Mama?"
249198,L481261,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?"
249199,L481260,u7395,m500,ESTELLA,"Mama, can I put the candles ..."
249200,L481236,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Later. When I finish the ironing.
249201,L481235,u7395,m500,ESTELLA,Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
249202,L481234,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"No, Estellita."
249203,L481233,u7395,m500,ESTELLA,"Are you sick, Mama?"
249204,L481843,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
249205,L481842,u7404,m500,TERESA,So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
249206,L481772,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down."
249207,L481771,u7404,m500,TERESA,It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
249208,L481716,u7404,m500,TERESA,Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
249209,L481715,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
249210,L481351,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
249211,L481350,u7404,m500,TERESA,"Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to."
249212,L481343,u7404,m500,TERESA,Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
249213,L481342,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,To the mine?
249214,L481861,u7399,m500,RAMN,This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
249215,L481860,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,What are you saying?
249216,L481859,u7399,m500,RAMN,This is what we've been waiting for.
249217,L481839,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
249218,L481838,u7399,m500,RAMN,Will you be still?
249219,L481837,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ..."
249220,L481836,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Shut up, you're talking crazy."
249221,L481835,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. ""Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican"" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, ""Stay in your place."" Do you feel better having someone lower than you?"
249222,L481834,u7399,m500,RAMN,You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
249223,L481833,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?"
249224,L481832,u7399,m500,RAMN,I don't know what you're talking about.
249225,L481831,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
249226,L481830,u7399,m500,RAMN,Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
249227,L481829,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
249228,L481828,u7399,m500,RAMN,Like what?
249229,L481827,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast."
249230,L481825,u7399,m500,RAMN,Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
249231,L481824,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,You mean you're ready to give up?
249232,L481823,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it."
249233,L481822,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
249234,L481821,u7399,m500,RAMN,"And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?"
249235,L481820,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
249236,L481819,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral."
249237,L481818,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
249238,L481817,u7399,m500,RAMN,Why not? I'm not needed here.
249239,L481816,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Ramn -- you can't.
249240,L481815,u7399,m500,RAMN,No.
249241,L481814,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Alone?
249242,L481813,u7399,m500,RAMN,Sun up.
249243,L481812,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,When?
249244,L481811,u7399,m500,RAMN,Hunting.
249245,L481810,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Where are you going?
249246,L481808,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
249247,L481807,u7399,m500,RAMN,We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
249248,L481806,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Tell me.
249249,L481805,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
249250,L481804,u7399,m500,RAMN,Be still ...
249251,L481803,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?"
249252,L481802,u7399,m500,RAMN,You weren't waiting for me.
249253,L481801,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I waited up till midnight.
249254,L481776,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
249255,L481775,u7399,m500,RAMN,A meeting?
249256,L481774,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"All right, but later. I've got a meeting now."
249257,L481773,u7399,m500,RAMN,"We've got to have a talk, you and me."
249258,L481770,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy."
249259,L481769,u7399,m500,RAMN,But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
249260,L481768,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"No, no ... we wouldn't do it."
249261,L481767,u7399,m500,RAMN,Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
249262,L481764,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
249263,L481763,u7399,m500,RAMN,Four nights. How did you sleep?
249264,L481762,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
249265,L481761,u7399,m500,RAMN,How do you feel?
249266,L481685,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line."
249267,L481684,u7399,m500,RAMN,I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
249268,L481683,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I've had them since the day they were born.
249269,L481682,u7399,m500,RAMN,"You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!"
249270,L481681,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I'm going back tomorrow.
249271,L481680,u7399,m500,RAMN,"I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?"
249272,L481679,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Yes.
249273,L481678,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Must've been some experience for you, huh?"
249274,L481677,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Sure.
249275,L481676,u7399,m500,RAMN,You all right?
249276,L481649,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Backward.
249277,L481648,u7399,m500,RAMN,Can be what?
249278,L481647,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Anglo husbands can also be backward.
249279,L481646,u7399,m500,RAMN,There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
249280,L481645,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky."
249281,L481644,u7399,m500,RAMN,"She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there."
249282,L481643,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes."
249283,L481642,u7399,m500,RAMN,The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
249284,L481641,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
249285,L481640,u7399,m500,RAMN,No.
249286,L481639,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote."
249287,L481580,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
249288,L481579,u7399,m500,RAMN,But it's yours. I won't let them ...
249289,L481578,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
249290,L481577,u7399,m500,RAMN,Over my dead body.
249291,L481576,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Let them take it!
249292,L481570,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone."
249293,L481569,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,What makes you so sure?
249294,L481568,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike."
249295,L481567,u7399,m500,RAMN,"I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you."
249296,L481566,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,You are no good to me -- in jail.
249297,L481565,u7399,m500,RAMN,They say I am no good to you.
249298,L481564,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,What were they saying? About you? In there?
249299,L481563,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,He'll have it good. Some day.
249300,L481562,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good."
249301,L481561,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,He was born fighting. And born hungry.
249302,L481560,u7399,m500,RAMN,"A fighter, huh?"
249303,L481508,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
249304,L481507,u7399,m500,RAMN,Mother of God ...have mercy ...
249305,L481466,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
249306,L481465,u7399,m500,RAMN,What's the matter?
249307,L481327,u7399,m500,RAMN,I did forget. Lus told me.
249308,L481326,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
249309,L481325,u7399,m500,RAMN,Antonio paid for it.
249310,L481324,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"Was it expensive, the beer?"
249311,L481323,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"No, no ..."
249312,L481322,u7399,m500,RAMN,I'm a fool.
249313,L481321,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
249314,L481292,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Aaah, what's the use?"
249315,L481291,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Never... never... never!
249316,L481290,u7399,m500,RAMN,Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
249317,L481289,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
249318,L481288,u7399,m500,RAMN,Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
249319,L481287,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio..."
249320,L481286,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!"
249321,L481285,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"What has it got me, your union?"
249322,L481284,u7399,m500,RAMN,Now don't start talking against the union again.
249323,L481283,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,"I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later."
249324,L481282,u7399,m500,RAMN,First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
249325,L481281,u7399,m500,RAMN,"The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there."
249326,L481280,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,What's more important than sanitation?
249327,L481279,u7399,m500,RAMN,We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
249328,L481278,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,What?
249329,L481277,u7399,m500,RAMN,We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
249330,L481275,u7399,m500,RAMN,Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
249331,L481274,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
249332,L481273,u7399,m500,RAMN,Forget it.
249333,L481272,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
249334,L481271,u7399,m500,RAMN,This water's cold again.
249335,L481270,u7399,m500,RAMN,Got to talk to the brothers.
249336,L481269,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,Where you going?
249337,L481267,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
249338,L481266,u7399,m500,RAMN,"But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen"
249339,L481265,u7399,m500,RAMN,"It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?"
249340,L481264,u7394,m500,ESPERANZA,We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
249341,L481553,u7400,m500,RUTH,"Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either."
249342,L481552,u7396,m500,FRANK,"Aw, cut it out, Ruth."
249343,L481551,u7400,m500,RUTH,"Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights."
249344,L481550,u7396,m500,FRANK,We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
249345,L481400,u7400,m500,RUTH,"Or why don't you just put a sign outside? ""No dogs or women allowed!"""
249346,L481399,u7396,m500,FRANK,But honey ...
249347,L481398,u7400,m500,RUTH,Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
249348,L481537,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, ""Who's that? His grandfather?"""
249349,L481536,u7396,m500,FRANK,You know I don't think that.
249350,L481535,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?"
249351,L481534,u7396,m500,FRANK,Go on. Spill it.
249352,L481523,u7396,m500,FRANK,"Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike."
249353,L481522,u7399,m500,RAMN,Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
249354,L481305,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!"
249355,L481304,u7396,m500,FRANK,"Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, ""Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."""
249356,L481303,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions."
249357,L481302,u7396,m500,FRANK,Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
249358,L481301,u7399,m500,RAMN,Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
249359,L481457,u7397,m500,HARTWELL,Are we talking to a union spokesman?
249360,L481456,u7399,m500,RAMN,It's possible. Just negotiate.
249361,L481455,u7397,m500,HARTWELL,"Well, if that's possible ..."
249362,L481454,u7399,m500,RAMN,Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
249363,L481453,u7397,m500,HARTWELL,No ...
249364,L481452,u7399,m500,RAMN,New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
249365,L481451,u7397,m500,HARTWELL,No. New York.
249366,L481450,u7399,m500,RAMN,You mean Delaware?
249367,L481449,u7397,m500,HARTWELL,That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
249368,L481758,u7399,m500,RAMN,You should have helped her without being asked.
249369,L481757,u7398,m500,LUIS,But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
249370,L481756,u7399,m500,RAMN,You've got to help around the house!
249371,L481755,u7398,m500,LUIS,But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
249372,L481754,u7399,m500,RAMN,Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
249373,L481753,u7398,m500,LUIS,The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
249374,L481752,u7399,m500,RAMN,The what!
249375,L481751,u7398,m500,LUIS,"Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ..."
249376,L481675,u7399,m500,RAMN,"I don't want you hanging around there, hear?"
249377,L481674,u7398,m500,LUIS,Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
249378,L481673,u7398,m500,LUIS,She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
249379,L481672,u7399,m500,RAMN,Where's your mama?
249380,L481470,u7398,m500,LUIS,Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
249381,L481469,u7399,m500,RAMN,Lus! Come down here!
249382,L481312,u7398,m500,LUIS,It's Mama's Saint's Day.
249383,L481311,u7399,m500,RAMN,Forgot what?
249384,L481310,u7398,m500,LUIS,I thought maybe you forgot...
249385,L481309,u7399,m500,RAMN,What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
249386,L481485,u7399,m500,RAMN,You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
249387,L481484,u7402,m500,SEBASTIAN,"I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go."
249388,L481483,u7399,m500,RAMN,"You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?"
249389,L481482,u7402,m500,SEBASTIAN,My kids don't have enough to eat!
249390,L481481,u7399,m500,RAMN,T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
249391,L481480,u7402,m500,SEBASTIAN,Ramn -- listen my kids ...
249392,L481479,u7399,m500,RAMN,You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
249393,L481478,u7402,m500,SEBASTIAN,Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
249394,L481477,u7399,m500,RAMN,"You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ..."
249395,L481476,u7402,m500,SEBASTIAN,Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
249396,L481533,u7399,m500,RAMN,Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
249397,L481532,u7401,m500,SAL,Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
249398,L481531,u7399,m500,RAMN,"He's a guest in my house, isn't he?"
249399,L481530,u7401,m500,SAL,You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
249400,L481529,u7399,m500,RAMN,What attitude?
249401,L481528,u7401,m500,SAL,And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
249402,L481307,u7399,m500,RAMN,"Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? ""Pay -- or we take it away."" Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!"
249403,L481306,u7401,m500,SAL,"But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win."
249404,L482520,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,I was talking to my wife.
249405,L482519,u7405,m501,BO,"No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it."
249406,L482518,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,You mind?
249407,L482517,u7405,m501,BO,Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
249408,L482516,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
249409,L482515,u7405,m501,BO,Good. I fucking hate Australians.
249410,L482514,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,No.
249411,L482513,u7405,m501,BO,Are you Australian?
249412,L482512,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,That's it?
249413,L482511,u7405,m501,BO,What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
249414,L481933,u7406,m501,BOBBY,"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ..."
249415,L481932,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"Fuck man. Come on, Bobby."
249416,L481926,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Come on.  Ease off the girl.
249417,L481925,u7406,m501,BOBBY,What?
249418,L481922,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us."
249419,L481921,u7406,m501,BOBBY,What can I do for you?
249420,L481920,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Yeah.
249421,L481919,u7406,m501,BOBBY,"Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy."
249422,L481916,u7406,m501,BOBBY,The spiders.
249423,L481915,u7413,m501,JIMMY,What?
249424,L481914,u7406,m501,BOBBY,Shhh.
249425,L481913,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Bobby?
249426,L482610,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Nothing, I'm trying to remember..."
249427,L482609,u7407,m501,BOOKMAN,What is it?
249428,L482607,u7410,m501,DANNY,"No, Why?"
249429,L482606,u7407,m501,BOOKMAN,Did you see his hair color?
249430,L482605,u7410,m501,DANNY,They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
249431,L482604,u7407,m501,BOOKMAN,How about in the house?
249432,L482603,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Yeah, but he was in silhouette."
249433,L482602,u7410,m501,DANNY,
249434,L482601,u7407,m501,BOOKMAN,Not even a guess?
249435,L482600,u7410,m501,DANNY,All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
249436,L482585,u7410,m501,DANNY,I'll see you tonight.
249437,L482584,u7408,m501,BUBBA,"I ain't a idiot, asshole."
249438,L482583,u7410,m501,DANNY,Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
249439,L482582,u7408,m501,BUBBA,Yeah.
249440,L482581,u7410,m501,DANNY,Everything go?
249441,L482580,u7408,m501,BUBBA,Yeah.
249442,L482241,u7408,m501,BUBBA,"Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss."
249443,L482240,u7410,m501,DANNY,I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
249444,L482239,u7408,m501,BUBBA,"I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules."
249445,L482238,u7410,m501,DANNY,Now that's down-right insulting.
249446,L482237,u7408,m501,BUBBA,"Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner."
249447,L482236,u7410,m501,DANNY,Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
249448,L482235,u7408,m501,BUBBA,I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
249449,L482040,u7410,m501,DANNY,It's downright classy is what it is.
249450,L482039,u7408,m501,BUBBA,"First rate, ain't it?"
249451,L482038,u7410,m501,DANNY,Who wouldn't?
249452,L482037,u7408,m501,BUBBA,You like that?
249453,L482036,u7410,m501,DANNY,Ride 'em cowboy)
249454,L482701,u7410,m501,DANNY,Your daughter needs you.  Go.
249455,L482700,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I don't want to leave you.
249456,L482699,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Colette, go."
249457,L482689,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Danny, it's not what you think."
249458,L482688,u7410,m501,DANNY,"You're good, princess. I'll give you that."
249459,L482541,u7410,m501,DANNY,Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
249460,L482540,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Why?
249461,L482539,u7410,m501,DANNY,Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
249462,L482537,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I don't want to.
249463,L482536,u7410,m501,DANNY,Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
249464,L482535,u7409,m501,COLETTE,What is it?
249465,L482534,u7410,m501,DANNY,I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
249466,L482533,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Really, I don't want to."
249467,L482530,u7410,m501,DANNY,Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
249468,L482529,u7409,m501,COLETTE,They would have killed you too.
249469,L482528,u7410,m501,DANNY,"No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something."
249470,L482507,u7410,m501,DANNY,I can't tell you.
249471,L482506,u7409,m501,COLETTE,No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
249472,L482505,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Look, maybe you oughta' leave."
249473,L482504,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"What's wrong, Danny?"
249474,L482503,u7410,m501,DANNY,I just can't. Okay?
249475,L482502,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Why not?
249476,L482498,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I been that way ever since.
249477,L482497,u7410,m501,DANNY,Ass first into the world.
249478,L482496,u7409,m501,COLETTE,From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
249479,L482495,u7410,m501,DANNY,You always been this stubborn?
249480,L482494,u7409,m501,COLETTE,It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
249481,L482493,u7410,m501,DANNY,Find a new job.
249482,L482492,u7409,m501,COLETTE,He knows where I work.
249483,L482491,u7410,m501,DANNY,You can still work.
249484,L482490,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I need my paycheck.
249485,L482489,u7410,m501,DANNY,What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
249486,L482488,u7409,m501,COLETTE,We been through that.
249487,L482486,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Please open the door, Danny."
249488,L482485,u7410,m501,DANNY,I'm kind of busy.
249489,L482484,u7409,m501,COLETTE,It's me.
249490,L482483,u7410,m501,DANNY,Who is it?
249491,L482359,u7410,m501,DANNY,No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
249492,L482358,u7409,m501,COLETTE,You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
249493,L482357,u7410,m501,DANNY,Therapy session is over.
249494,L482356,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"What are you hiding, Danny?"
249495,L482355,u7410,m501,DANNY,"You don't like the tune, find another station."
249496,L482354,u7409,m501,COLETTE,There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
249497,L482353,u7410,m501,DANNY,Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
249498,L482352,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield."
249499,L482351,u7410,m501,DANNY,How much time do you have?
249500,L482350,u7409,m501,COLETTE,What is wrong with you?
249501,L482349,u7410,m501,DANNY,How much time do you have?
249502,L482348,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
249503,L482347,u7410,m501,DANNY,"So you're just attracted to me, is that it?"
249504,L482346,u7409,m501,COLETTE,This has nothing to do with him.
249505,L482345,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after."
249506,L482344,u7409,m501,COLETTE,You really need to lighten up.
249507,L482343,u7410,m501,DANNY,It gets me through the day.
249508,L482342,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
249509,L482341,u7410,m501,DANNY,"What do you want from me, Colette?"
249510,L482340,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Nothing.
249511,L482339,u7410,m501,DANNY,: What are you up to?
249512,L482336,u7410,m501,DANNY,I try.
249513,L482335,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Is that how you play?
249514,L482334,u7410,m501,DANNY,It's the only way to play.
249515,L482333,u7409,m501,COLETTE,And you admire that?
249516,L482332,u7410,m501,DANNY,Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
249517,L482331,u7410,m501,DANNY,Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
249518,L482330,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Like you?
249519,L482329,u7410,m501,DANNY,Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
249520,L482328,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Never heard of him.
249521,L482327,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Miles Davis. ""All Blues."""
249522,L482326,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Trust me. We're safe.
249523,L482325,u7410,m501,DANNY,How far out of town?
249524,L482324,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Don't worry. He's out of town.
249525,L482323,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?"
249526,L482322,u7409,m501,COLETTE,What happened to your eye?
249527,L482321,u7410,m501,DANNY,Oh. Hi.
249528,L482233,u7409,m501,COLETTE,How?
249529,L482232,u7410,m501,DANNY,Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
249530,L482231,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
249531,L482230,u7410,m501,DANNY,That's long enough to get out of town.
249532,L482229,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
249533,L482228,u7410,m501,DANNY,Why don't you call the cops?
249534,L482227,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Because he'll kill me.
249535,L482226,u7410,m501,DANNY,Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
249536,L482225,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Fuck you.
249537,L482224,u7410,m501,DANNY,You get off on abuse or something?
249538,L482223,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I can't leave.
249539,L482222,u7410,m501,DANNY,There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
249540,L482221,u7409,m501,COLETTE,You don't understand.
249541,L482220,u7410,m501,DANNY,Why not?
249542,L482219,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I can't.
249543,L482218,u7410,m501,DANNY,Then leave.
249544,L482217,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch."
249545,L482216,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt."
249546,L482215,u7409,m501,COLETTE,It's not that easy.
249547,L482214,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?"
249548,L482213,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Go ahead.
249549,L482212,u7410,m501,DANNY,Nothing.
249550,L482211,u7409,m501,COLETTE,What?
249551,L482210,u7410,m501,DANNY,Colette ...
249552,L482209,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Oh, he's a keeper all right."
249553,L482208,u7410,m501,DANNY,This man sounds like a real catch.
249554,L482207,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now."
249555,L482206,u7410,m501,DANNY,Ouch.
249556,L482205,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to."
249557,L482203,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"That bad, huh?"
249558,L482202,u7410,m501,DANNY,Leave me out of this.
249559,L482201,u7409,m501,COLETTE,What about the guy on the very bottom?
249560,L482200,u7410,m501,DANNY,I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
249561,L482199,u7409,m501,COLETTE,How?
249562,L482198,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Come on, cheer up. It could be worse."
249563,L482197,u7409,m501,COLETTE,Oh God.
249564,L482196,u7410,m501,DANNY,I was thinking Alice Cooper.
249565,L482195,u7409,m501,COLETTE,"Jesus, I look like a raccoon."
249566,L482192,u7409,m501,COLETTE,I understand. Thanks anyway.
249567,L482191,u7410,m501,DANNY,Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
249568,L482631,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help."
249569,L482630,u7419,m501,TRAHN,What?
249570,L482629,u7410,m501,DANNY,Oh shit
249571,L482628,u7419,m501,TRAHN,"Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive."
249572,L482627,u7410,m501,DANNY,I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
249573,L482626,u7419,m501,TRAHN,How you holding up?
249574,L482620,u7410,m501,DANNY,These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
249575,L482619,u7419,m501,TRAHN,That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
249576,L482618,u7410,m501,DANNY,"I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it."
249577,L482476,u7410,m501,DANNY,How?
249578,L482475,u7416,m501,NANCY,It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
249579,L482474,u7410,m501,DANNY,I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
249580,L482473,u7416,m501,NANCY,Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
249581,L482472,u7410,m501,DANNY,"I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me."
249582,L482467,u7416,m501,NANCY,I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
249583,L482466,u7410,m501,DANNY,Maybe I am dealing with it.
249584,L482465,u7416,m501,NANCY,"You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding."
249585,L482464,u7410,m501,DANNY,Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
249586,L482463,u7416,m501,NANCY,I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
249587,L482462,u7410,m501,DANNY,Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
249588,L482456,u7416,m501,NANCY,"Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you."
249589,L482455,u7410,m501,DANNY,"All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?"
249590,L482454,u7410,m501,DANNY,It's Tom.
249591,L482453,u7416,m501,NANCY,Who is it?
249592,L482579,u7410,m501,DANNY,You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
249593,L482578,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
249594,L482576,u7410,m501,DANNY,Good for you Jimmy.
249595,L482575,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?"
249596,L482573,u7410,m501,DANNY,I'm sorry. I couldn't.
249597,L482572,u7413,m501,JIMMY,I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
249598,L482570,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear."
249599,L482569,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?"
249600,L482568,u7413,m501,JIMMY,And you want me to do you some big favor?
249601,L482567,u7410,m501,DANNY,I don't trust anybody.
249602,L482566,u7413,m501,JIMMY,You don't trust me?
249603,L482565,u7410,m501,DANNY,I can't tell you.
249604,L482564,u7413,m501,JIMMY,But... why? Why would you pretend?
249605,L482563,u7410,m501,DANNY,Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
249606,L482562,u7413,m501,JIMMY,No one ever noticed?
249607,L482561,u7410,m501,DANNY,"You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?"
249608,L482560,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?"
249609,L482559,u7410,m501,DANNY,When? When did you ever see me use?
249610,L482558,u7413,m501,JIMMY,But...I've seen you.
249611,L482557,u7410,m501,DANNY,I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
249612,L482556,u7413,m501,JIMMY,What?
249613,L482555,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?"
249614,L482554,u7410,m501,DANNY,What the hell is that?
249615,L482553,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"Hey, check it out..."
249616,L482552,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you."
249617,L482551,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you."
249618,L482550,u7410,m501,DANNY,Why?
249619,L482549,u7413,m501,JIMMY,It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
249620,L482548,u7410,m501,DANNY,Wait till I tell you what it is.
249621,L482547,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Okay
249622,L482546,u7410,m501,DANNY,You aren't coming with me.
249623,L482545,u7413,m501,JIMMY,But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
249624,L482544,u7410,m501,DANNY,Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
249625,L482543,u7413,m501,JIMMY,What's this?
249626,L482161,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Thanks for not laughing at me.
249627,L482160,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Yes, Jimmy."
249628,L482159,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Danny?
249629,L482158,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Yes, Jimmy"
249630,L482157,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Was he the president?
249631,L482156,u7410,m501,DANNY,John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
249632,L482155,u7413,m501,JIMMY,What does J.F.K. stand for?
249633,L482154,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Sure, Jimmy."
249634,L482153,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Can I ask you something?
249635,L482152,u7410,m501,DANNY,No. I'm good.
249636,L482151,u7413,m501,JIMMY,You want a hit?
249637,L482096,u7413,m501,JIMMY,No  You think she's a tweaker?
249638,L482095,u7410,m501,DANNY,You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
249639,L482093,u7410,m501,DANNY,"You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy."
249640,L482092,u7413,m501,JIMMY,He doesn't have one.
249641,L482091,u7410,m501,DANNY,You're going to have to explain that one.
249642,L482090,u7413,m501,JIMMY,I think on account of his nose.
249643,L482089,u7410,m501,DANNY,Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
249644,L482088,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Palmdale
249645,L482087,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?"
249646,L482086,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"You mean, like to throw 'em off?"
249647,L482085,u7410,m501,DANNY,"You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over."
249648,L482081,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world."
249649,L482080,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?"
249650,L482079,u7410,m501,DANNY,Not tonight.
249651,L482078,u7413,m501,JIMMY,You wanna score some go-fast?
249652,L482077,u7413,m501,JIMMY,The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
249653,L482076,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Jimmy, where do you find these people?"
249654,L482073,u7413,m501,JIMMY,10%.  That's ...
249655,L482072,u7410,m501,DANNY,I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
249656,L482071,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Sure.
249657,L482070,u7410,m501,DANNY,Can you set that up?
249658,L482069,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him."
249659,L482068,u7410,m501,DANNY,Can your man handle that?
249660,L482067,u7413,m501,JIMMY,Fuuuuuck
249661,L482066,u7410,m501,DANNY,"A quarter of a million, Jimmy."
249662,L482065,u7413,m501,JIMMY,A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
249663,L482064,u7410,m501,DANNY,I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
249664,L482063,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire."
249665,L482062,u7410,m501,DANNY,You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
249666,L482061,u7413,m501,JIMMY,I find myself in dire need of some cash.
249667,L482060,u7410,m501,DANNY,Don't get carried away.
249668,L482059,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man."
249669,L482058,u7410,m501,DANNY,What?
249670,L482057,u7413,m501,JIMMY,See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
249671,L482056,u7410,m501,DANNY,Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
249672,L482055,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"So, why'd you want to see me?"
249673,L482052,u7410,m501,DANNY,I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
249674,L482051,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'."
249675,L482050,u7410,m501,DANNY,That's a good one.

249702,L482479,u7420,m501,VERNE,You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
249703,L482478,u7410,m501,DANNY,What does that mean?
249704,L482477,u7420,m501,VERNE,By not disgracing her memory!

249715,L482438,u7410,m501,DANNY,Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
249716,L482437,u7417,m501,POOH-BEAR,No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.

249786,L482368,u7418,m501,TANNER,That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
249787,L482367,u7410,m501,DANNY,What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
249788,L482366,u7418,m501,TANNER,Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
249789,L482365,u7410,m501,DANNY,Whata you mean?  He told me -
249790,L482364,u7418,m501,TANNER,That's because he doesn't have one.
249791,L482295,u7418,m501,TANNER,"You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?"
249792,L482294,u7410,m501,DANNY,"News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat."
249793,L482293,u7418,m501,TANNER,Bullshit. He's a liar.
249794,L482282,u7418,m501,TANNER,"No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?"
249795,L482281,u7410,m501,DANNY,For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
249796,L482280,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ..."
249797,L482279,u7410,m501,DANNY,Whata you mean I've got no choice?
249798,L482278,u7418,m501,TANNER,You've got no choice.
249799,L482275,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him."
249800,L482274,u7418,m501,TANNER,Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
249801,L482273,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory."
249802,L482272,u7418,m501,TANNER,What're your taking down?
249803,L482267,u7410,m501,DANNY,After that ass-whipping you gave me?
249804,L482266,u7418,m501,TANNER,"You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne."
249805,L482265,u7410,m501,DANNY,Bubba.
249806,L482264,u7418,m501,TANNER,This chink have a name?
249807,L482263,u7410,m501,DANNY,I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
249808,L482254,u7410,m501,DANNY,"I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl."
249809,L482253,u7418,m501,TANNER,You think this is funny motherfucker?
249810,L482251,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play."
249811,L482250,u7410,m501,DANNY,Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
249812,L482249,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Cut the shit, Flynne."
249813,L482248,u7410,m501,DANNY,I was trying to score some dope.
249814,L482247,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Question is, what are you doing here?"
249815,L482246,u7410,m501,DANNY,What the hell are you doing here?
249816,L482035,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out."
249817,L482034,u7410,m501,DANNY,When?
249818,L482033,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A."
249819,L482028,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people."
249820,L482027,u7410,m501,DANNY,"If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man."
249821,L482014,u7410,m501,DANNY,Tell me what?
249822,L482013,u7418,m501,TANNER,I was getting to it.
249823,L482011,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money."
249824,L482010,u7410,m501,DANNY,Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
249825,L482009,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know."
249826,L482008,u7410,m501,DANNY,You don't find that repugnant?
249827,L482007,u7418,m501,TANNER,The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
249828,L482006,u7410,m501,DANNY,Don't you wonder why I do it?
249829,L482005,u7418,m501,TANNER,It's not my place.
249830,L482004,u7410,m501,DANNY,Thanks for not judging me.
249831,L482003,u7418,m501,TANNER,Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
249832,L482002,u7410,m501,DANNY,Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
249833,L482001,u7418,m501,TANNER,Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
249834,L482000,u7410,m501,DANNY,You think I'm a Judas?
249835,L481966,u7410,m501,DANNY,Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
249836,L481965,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Danny, I'm touched."
249837,L481964,u7410,m501,DANNY,Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
249838,L481963,u7418,m501,TANNER,"God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker."
249839,L481962,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too."
249840,L481951,u7410,m501,DANNY,It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
249841,L481950,u7418,m501,TANNER,No last name?
249842,L481949,u7410,m501,DANNY,Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
249843,L481948,u7418,m501,TANNER,What?
249844,L481947,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Bobby, rhymes with hobby."
249845,L481946,u7418,m501,TANNER,You got a name?
249846,L481945,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat."
249847,L481944,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?"
249848,L481943,u7410,m501,DANNY,"If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville."
249849,L481942,u7418,m501,TANNER,"You go, boy."
249850,L481941,u7410,m501,DANNY,I've got a hot one.
249851,L482588,u7410,m501,DANNY,With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
249852,L482587,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Nervous?
249853,L482447,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
249854,L482446,u7410,m501,DANNY,"You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit."
249855,L482388,u7410,m501,DANNY,"I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week."
249856,L482387,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,When is the deal going down?
249857,L482382,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
249858,L482381,u7410,m501,DANNY,Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
249859,L482376,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,You mean the menacing red car?
249860,L482375,u7410,m501,DANNY,Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
249861,L482372,u7410,m501,DANNY,What if he caps me before you can make a move?
249862,L482371,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
249863,L482370,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Funny, I don't feel lucky."
249864,L482369,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"You're lucky, Flynne."
249865,L482363,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,They have. But they never found a lab.
249866,L482362,u7410,m501,DANNY,Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
249867,L482361,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"Several possession charges, but nothing major."
249868,L482360,u7410,m501,DANNY,Excuse me?
249869,L482292,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack."
249870,L482291,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood."
249871,L482290,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"Who'd have thought it?  Danny ""Chickenshit"" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses."
249872,L482289,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?"
249873,L482288,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"What'd you do, piss your pants?"
249874,L482287,u7410,m501,DANNY,That would be me.
249875,L482286,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,What's that smell?
249876,L482271,u7410,m501,DANNY,Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
249877,L482270,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne."
249878,L482269,u7410,m501,DANNY,Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
249879,L482268,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,What's on the other end of this thing?
249880,L482262,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news."
249881,L482261,u7410,m501,DANNY,He's the only one I told.
249882,L482260,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Who the hell is Jimmy?
249883,L482259,u7410,m501,DANNY,Jimmy?
249884,L482257,u7410,m501,DANNY,I still don't know what you're talking about.
249885,L482256,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,We know what's going on.
249886,L482032,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
249887,L482031,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me."
249888,L482025,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
249889,L482024,u7410,m501,DANNY,What?!
249890,L482023,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,He knows somebody ratted him.
249891,L482022,u7410,m501,DANNY,And what does this have to do with me?
249892,L482021,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,The Mexicali Boys
249893,L482020,u7410,m501,DANNY,To who?
249894,L482019,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Turns out he's connected.
249895,L482018,u7410,m501,DANNY,Yeah.  What about him?
249896,L482017,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?"
249897,L481970,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect."
249898,L481969,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne."
249899,L481968,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?"
249900,L481967,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
249901,L481957,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,What's he holding?
249902,L481956,u7410,m501,DANNY,"Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards."
249903,L481955,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne."
249904,L481954,u7410,m501,DANNY,That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
249905,L481953,u7410,m501,DANNY,It speaks!
249906,L481952,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,This the guy?
249907,L482316,u7415,m501,LIZ,Why are you doing this?
249908,L482315,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,My sentiments exactly.
249909,L482314,u7415,m501,LIZ,That is so unfair.
249910,L482313,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right."
249911,L482312,u7415,m501,LIZ,"Here it comes, poor Tom."
249912,L482311,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
249913,L482310,u7415,m501,LIZ,"Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old."
249914,L482309,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?"
249915,L482308,u7415,m501,LIZ,Just admit you're wrong.
249916,L482307,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"Just no pleasing you, is there?"
249917,L482306,u7415,m501,LIZ,"I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost."
249918,L482305,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?"
249919,L482304,u7415,m501,LIZ,Look at that place. It's creepy.
249920,L482303,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,What do you mean?
249921,L482302,u7415,m501,LIZ,You think that's a good idea?
249922,L482301,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions."
249923,L482300,u7415,m501,LIZ,"Tom, quit fucking around."
249924,L482299,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?"
249925,L482298,u7415,m501,LIZ,You mean like the Donner Party?
249926,L482297,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?"
249927,L482296,u7415,m501,LIZ,Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
249928,L481996,u7415,m501,LIZ,No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
249929,L481995,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,There's no motels around here.
249930,L481994,u7415,m501,LIZ,"Tom, let's spend the night here."
249931,L481991,u7415,m501,LIZ,It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
249932,L481990,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,Really?
249933,L481989,u7415,m501,LIZ,And you've got wiener breath.
249934,L481988,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"You, madam, are a heartless wench."
249935,L481987,u7415,m501,LIZ,I was talking about Miles.
249936,L481986,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,"Again, I thank you."
249937,L481985,u7415,m501,LIZ,And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
249938,L481984,u7411,m501,DANNY/TOM,Thank you.  Thank you very much.
249939,L481983,u7415,m501,LIZ,"A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece."
249940,L482648,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Maybe he isn't showing.
249941,L482647,u7418,m501,TANNER,Where's Bubba?
249942,L482590,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident."
249943,L482589,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
249944,L482441,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,"Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat."
249945,L482440,u7418,m501,TANNER,We're in business.
249946,L482385,u7418,m501,TANNER,Now that's scary!
249947,L482384,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
249948,L482374,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,Don't we always take good care of you?
249949,L482373,u7418,m501,TANNER,"Golly, I hadn't thought of that."
249950,L482285,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
249951,L482284,u7418,m501,TANNER,"And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat."
249952,L482243,u7418,m501,TANNER,Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
249953,L482242,u7412,m501,GARCETTI,You thinking what I'm thinking?
249954,L482185,u7413,m501,JIMMY,I thought you were done.
249955,L482184,u7414,m501,KUJO,"Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team."
249956,L482180,u7414,m501,KUJO,"No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up."
249957,L482179,u7413,m501,JIMMY,I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
249958,L482178,u7414,m501,KUJO,Don't worry about it.
249959,L482177,u7413,m501,JIMMY,What is that? Rum and coke?
249960,L482165,u7414,m501,KUJO,Better than drugs.
249961,L482164,u7413,m501,JIMMY,"What is it, drugs?"
249962,L482163,u7414,m501,KUJO,"Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday."
249963,L482833,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Thank you, sir."
249964,L482832,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"Good luck, John."
249965,L482828,u7423,m502,MILLER,"The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is."
249966,L482827,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"Alright, I'll give you that. Continue."
249967,L482824,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir."
249968,L482823,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"Spit it out, Captain."
249969,L482822,u7423,m502,MILLER,"But, sir...I...I..."
249970,L482821,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff."
249971,L482820,u7423,m502,MILLER,"A private, sir?"
249972,L482819,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company."
249973,L482818,u7423,m502,MILLER,Sir?
249974,L482817,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you."
249975,L482816,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns."
249976,L482815,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,Where are your men now?
249977,L482814,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Yes, sir."
249978,L482813,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it."
249979,L482812,u7423,m502,MILLER,"They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir."
249980,L482811,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Fourty-four, twenty one dead."
249981,L482810,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,Casualties?
249982,L482809,u7423,m502,MILLER,"A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence."
249983,L482808,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,Resistance?
249984,L482807,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc."
249985,L482806,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,Report.
249986,L482804,u7421,m502,COLONEL ANDERSON,"...alright, let me know when."
249987,L482803,u7423,m502,MILLER,Find a chaplain.
249988,L483081,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Shit, that was no big deal."
249989,L483080,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across."
249990,L483064,u7428,m502,UPHAM,You take account of the wind?
249991,L483063,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Forty-two-hundred, I figure."
249992,L483062,u7428,m502,UPHAM,That must be four thousand yards.
249993,L483061,u7422,m502,JACKSON,Not where I come from.
249994,L483060,u7428,m502,UPHAM,You must be a hell a shot.
249995,L483059,u7422,m502,JACKSON,Yep.
249996,L483058,u7428,m502,UPHAM,The Army gave you that?
249997,L483057,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer."
249998,L482992,u7428,m502,UPHAM,What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
249999,L482991,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry."
250000,L482990,u7428,m502,UPHAM,So they travel around from place to place and preach?
250001,L482989,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family."
250002,L482988,u7428,m502,UPHAM,No kidding.
250003,L482987,u7422,m502,JACKSON,In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
250004,L482986,u7428,m502,UPHAM,In West Fork?
250005,L482985,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel."
250006,L482981,u7422,m502,JACKSON,Figured.
250007,L482980,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"As a matter of fact, I am."
250008,L482979,u7422,m502,JACKSON,You writin' a book or somethin'?
250009,L482978,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"So, where are you from?"
250010,L483541,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey."
250011,L483540,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee."
250012,L483539,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey..."
250013,L483533,u7424,m502,REIBEN,What deal?
250014,L483532,u7422,m502,JACKSON,No kiddin'?
250015,L483527,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Like hell, you did."
250016,L483526,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it."
250017,L483471,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Nope, he ain't Wade."
250018,L483470,u7422,m502,JACKSON,He ain't Wade.
250019,L483469,u7424,m502,REIBEN,I guess.
250020,L483468,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"He ain't half-bad, I guess."
250021,L483467,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?"
250022,L483466,u7422,m502,JACKSON,I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
250023,L483465,u7424,m502,REIBEN,What do you think?
250024,L483440,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Hell, no!"
250025,L483439,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?"
250026,L483438,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Y'all come back.
250027,L483393,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Of course, sir."
250028,L483392,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Yes, sir."
250029,L483384,u7422,m502,JACKSON,Cap'n...?
250030,L483383,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is."
250031,L483360,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
250032,L483359,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"So, that's Ryan."
250033,L483310,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live."
250034,L483309,u7424,m502,REIBEN,You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
250035,L483262,u7424,m502,REIBEN,The hell he didn't.
250036,L483261,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade."
250037,L483260,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard."
250038,L483259,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Shut up, will you?"
250039,L483258,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch."
250040,L483099,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother."
250041,L483098,u7422,m502,JACKSON,Last I knew.
250042,L483067,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"They got squirrels there, too, right?"
250043,L483066,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee."
250044,L483012,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there."
250045,L483011,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister."
250046,L483010,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me."
250047,L483005,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none."
250048,L483004,u7422,m502,JACKSON,You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
250049,L483003,u7424,m502,REIBEN,No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
250050,L482903,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off."
250051,L482902,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Jackson?
250052,L483549,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"To each, his own."
250053,L483548,u7423,m502,MILLER,It's worth it.
250054,L483547,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?"
250055,L483546,u7423,m502,MILLER,"You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all."
250056,L483545,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Say what, Cap'n?"
250057,L483544,u7423,m502,MILLER,"I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass."
250058,L483356,u7423,m502,MILLER,Keep trying.
250059,L483355,u7422,m502,JACKSON,Not yet.
250060,L483308,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Good, now get your goddamned gear."
250061,L483307,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand."
250062,L483306,u7423,m502,MILLER,"You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?"
250063,L483305,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner."
250064,L483303,u7423,m502,MILLER,Who's Wade?
250065,L483302,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade."
250066,L483301,u7423,m502,MILLER,"What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?"
250067,L483252,u7423,m502,MILLER,Gives Wade the second shot.
250068,L483251,u7422,m502,JACKSON,Watching.
250069,L483191,u7423,m502,MILLER,"They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast."
250070,L483190,u7422,m502,JACKSON,We left them eighty-eights.
250071,L483185,u7423,m502,MILLER,"My guess, too."
250072,L483184,u7422,m502,JACKSON,In the shadow by those two trees.
250073,L483183,u7423,m502,MILLER,Where?
250074,L483108,u7423,m502,MILLER,Wade?
250075,L483107,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent."
250076,L483106,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue."
250077,L483104,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on."
250078,L483103,u7423,m502,MILLER,I'd love to hear it.
250079,L483102,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Sir, I have an opinion on this matter."
250080,L483009,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity."
250081,L483008,u7423,m502,MILLER,"You didn't volunteer, Jackson."
250082,L483007,u7422,m502,JACKSON,"Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission."
250083,L482874,u7423,m502,MILLER,"No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there."
250084,L482873,u7427,m502,SUPPLY SERGEANT,Senator's son?
250085,L482872,u7423,m502,MILLER,"A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive."
250086,L482869,u7427,m502,SUPPLY SERGEANT,"That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me."
250087,L482868,u7423,m502,MILLER,How about that jeep?
250088,L482867,u7427,m502,SUPPLY SERGEANT,"Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?"
250089,L482866,u7423,m502,MILLER,"A half-track, anything."
250090,L482865,u7427,m502,SUPPLY SERGEANT,"No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir."
250091,L482864,u7423,m502,MILLER,White-walls?
250092,L482863,u7427,m502,SUPPLY SERGEANT,"Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior."
250093,L483529,u7423,m502,MILLER,I changed my mind.
250094,L483528,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Captain, what about our deal?"
250095,L483525,u7423,m502,MILLER,"I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania."
250096,L483524,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"What'd you say, Captain?"
250097,L483428,u7423,m502,MILLER,"That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers."
250098,L483427,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Goddamn it, sir..."
250099,L483426,u7423,m502,MILLER,"There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay."
250100,L483425,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"But, sir..."
250101,L483424,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice."
250102,L483420,u7428,m502,UPHAM,The Germans do.
250103,L483419,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Sure, you got one?"
250104,L483418,u7428,m502,UPHAM,Would they notice and eighty-eight?
250105,L483417,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades."
250106,L483416,u7428,m502,UPHAM,What about our grenades?
250107,L483408,u7423,m502,MILLER,Those guns are close.
250108,L483407,u7428,m502,UPHAM,I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
250109,L483387,u7423,m502,MILLER,You don't count.
250110,L483386,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"I'd like to stay, too, Captain."
250111,L483332,u7423,m502,MILLER,Same place we are.
250112,L483331,u7428,m502,UPHAM,I wonder where they're going.
250113,L483213,u7423,m502,MILLER,Plenty.
250114,L483212,u7428,m502,UPHAM,That only leaves three.
250115,L483211,u7423,m502,MILLER,"What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here."
250116,L483210,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"The men said, nine."
250117,L483209,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives."
250118,L483208,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Good luck, Captain."
250119,L483187,u7423,m502,MILLER,A machine gun.
250120,L483186,u7428,m502,UPHAM,What is it?
250121,L483181,u7423,m502,MILLER,Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
250122,L483180,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer."
250123,L483179,u7423,m502,MILLER,Did he see any sign of them?
250124,L483178,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone."
250125,L483175,u7423,m502,MILLER,I don't expect to live that long.
250126,L483174,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand."
250127,L483173,u7423,m502,MILLER,"I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money."
250128,L483172,u7428,m502,UPHAM,Over three-hundred.
250129,L483170,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Where are you from, Captain?"
250130,L483169,u7423,m502,MILLER,Some.
250131,L483168,u7428,m502,UPHAM,You know classical music?
250132,L483167,u7423,m502,MILLER,It seemed appropriate.
250133,L483166,u7428,m502,UPHAM,I heard.
250134,L483165,u7423,m502,MILLER,I've been humming it.
250135,L483164,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?"
250136,L483163,u7423,m502,MILLER,It looks like a Renoir.
250137,L483151,u7423,m502,MILLER,You think the rest of us were?
250138,L483150,u7428,m502,UPHAM,I wasn't made for this.
250139,L483113,u7423,m502,MILLER,Sarge?
250140,L483112,u7428,m502,UPHAM,Pass.
250141,L483111,u7423,m502,MILLER,Upham?
250142,L483079,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up."
250143,L483078,u7428,m502,UPHAM,But you could have gotten killed and I...
250144,L483077,u7423,m502,MILLER,It was nothing.
250145,L483076,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I..."
250146,L483045,u7423,m502,MILLER,DASHES across the street.
250147,L483044,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him."
250148,L483043,u7423,m502,MILLER,Glad of it.
250149,L482968,u7423,m502,MILLER,"That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell."
250150,L482967,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?"
250151,L482943,u7423,m502,MILLER,FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
250152,L482942,u7428,m502,UPHAM,I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
250153,L483435,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Yes, sir."
250154,L483434,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive."
250155,L483423,u7423,m502,MILLER,Out of the mouth of babes.
250156,L483422,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Uh, oh."
250157,L483413,u7423,m502,MILLER,We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
250158,L483412,u7426,m502,SARGE,What are we going to do?
250159,L483411,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks."
250160,L483410,u7426,m502,SARGE,What do you think?
250161,L483405,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Yes, sir."
250162,L483404,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable."
250163,L483296,u7423,m502,MILLER,"But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted."
250164,L483295,u7426,m502,SARGE,"You're welcome, John."
250165,L483294,u7423,m502,MILLER,Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
250166,L483292,u7426,m502,SARGE,I'll do my best.
250167,L483291,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore."
250168,L483290,u7426,m502,SARGE,I know.
250169,L483289,u7423,m502,MILLER,"You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive."
250170,L483288,u7426,m502,SARGE,Just what I want to do.
250171,L483287,u7423,m502,MILLER,"No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me."
250172,L483286,u7426,m502,SARGE,You want me to take over?
250173,L483285,u7423,m502,MILLER,"I think you're right, Keith."
250174,L483284,u7426,m502,SARGE,"John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up."
250175,L483283,u7423,m502,MILLER,"That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again."
250176,L483282,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Except this time, the mission IS a man."
250177,L483281,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men."
250178,L483280,u7426,m502,SARGE,And how do you bluff yourself?
250179,L483279,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie."
250180,L483278,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Oh, yeah?"
250181,L483277,u7423,m502,MILLER,It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
250182,L483276,u7423,m502,MILLER,"No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?"
250183,L483275,u7426,m502,SARGE,And what about your own hand?
250184,L483274,u7423,m502,MILLER,"She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him."
250185,L483273,u7426,m502,SARGE,Bits and pieces.
250186,L483272,u7423,m502,MILLER,You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
250187,L483271,u7426,m502,SARGE,Yeah.
250188,L483270,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?"
250189,L483269,u7426,m502,SARGE,Vecchio.
250190,L483268,u7423,m502,MILLER,"What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?"
250191,L483266,u7423,m502,MILLER,Let's just find someplace.
250192,L483265,u7426,m502,SARGE,You alright?
250193,L483247,u7423,m502,MILLER,Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
250194,L483246,u7426,m502,SARGE,Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
250195,L483245,u7423,m502,MILLER,"More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on..."
250196,L483244,u7423,m502,MILLER,SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
250197,L483238,u7423,m502,MILLER,About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
250198,L483237,u7426,m502,SARGE,Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
250199,L483231,u7423,m502,MILLER,Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
250200,L483230,u7426,m502,SARGE,HOLD YOUR FIRE!
250201,L483206,u7423,m502,MILLER,How about you shut up and take your position?
250202,L483205,u7426,m502,SARGE,How about...?
250203,L483204,u7423,m502,MILLER,How about you take your position?
250204,L483203,u7426,m502,SARGE,"How about I go right, sir?"
250205,L483202,u7423,m502,MILLER,Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
250206,L483161,u7423,m502,MILLER,I'll be alright.
250207,L483160,u7426,m502,SARGE,"You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore."
250208,L483159,u7423,m502,MILLER,No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
250209,L483158,u7426,m502,SARGE,Is it getting worse?
250210,L483157,u7423,m502,MILLER,A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
250211,L483149,u7423,m502,MILLER,It doesn't take this.
250212,L483148,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Makes you feel small, doesn't it?"
250213,L483146,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Yup, hell of a mission."
250214,L483145,u7423,m502,MILLER,Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
250215,L483144,u7426,m502,SARGE,I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
250216,L483143,u7423,m502,MILLER,You never know.
250217,L483142,u7426,m502,SARGE,You're kidding yourself.
250218,L483141,u7423,m502,MILLER,"If we stayed, we could make a difference."
250219,L483140,u7426,m502,SARGE,Three for three.
250220,L483139,u7423,m502,MILLER,Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
250221,L483138,u7426,m502,SARGE,Nope.
250222,L483137,u7423,m502,MILLER,They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
250223,L483136,u7426,m502,SARGE,And what about you?
250224,L483135,u7423,m502,MILLER,"They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright."
250225,L483134,u7426,m502,SARGE,You think they'll be alright?
250226,L483133,u7426,m502,SARGE,Good news?
250227,L483132,u7423,m502,MILLER,Nope.
250228,L483131,u7426,m502,SARGE,You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
250229,L483130,u7423,m502,MILLER,Since when have things been normal?
250230,L483129,u7426,m502,SARGE,"It's not normal, not reading letters from home."
250231,L483128,u7423,m502,MILLER,Maybe.
250232,L483127,u7426,m502,SARGE,You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
250233,L482975,u7423,m502,MILLER,Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
250234,L482974,u7426,m502,SARGE,"He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys."
250235,L482971,u7423,m502,MILLER,That's not what we're here for.
250236,L482970,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?"
250237,L482946,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Uh, Captain..."
250238,L482945,u7423,m502,MILLER,PUSH!
250239,L482944,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Uh, Captain..."
250240,L482900,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Yep, hell of a mission."
250241,L482899,u7426,m502,SARGE,Hell of a mission.
250242,L482898,u7423,m502,MILLER,"A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead."
250243,L482895,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind."
250244,L482894,u7426,m502,SARGE,We in radio contact with anybody up there?
250245,L482893,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot."
250246,L482860,u7423,m502,MILLER,I've got a line on one.
250247,L482859,u7426,m502,SARGE,"You get a translator, Captain?"
250248,L482849,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport."
250249,L482848,u7423,m502,MILLER,What about Talbot?
250250,L482847,u7426,m502,SARGE,Fresh out.
250251,L482846,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Okay, Wade.  Translators?"
250252,L482845,u7426,m502,SARGE,Beasley's dead.
250253,L482844,u7423,m502,MILLER,"I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition."
250254,L482843,u7426,m502,SARGE,Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
250255,L482842,u7423,m502,MILLER,Simpson.
250256,L482841,u7426,m502,SARGE,What about the company?
250257,L482840,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home."
250258,L482839,u7426,m502,SARGE,You?  Leading a squad?
250259,L482838,u7423,m502,MILLER,I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
250260,L482837,u7426,m502,SARGE,Caen?
250261,L482761,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered."
250262,L482760,u7426,m502,SARGE,You tryin' to get yourself killed?
250263,L482759,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Worked, didn't it?"
250264,L482753,u7423,m502,MILLER,I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
250265,L482752,u7426,m502,SARGE,"CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!"
250266,L482748,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind."
250267,L482747,u7423,m502,MILLER,GO!
250268,L483587,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die."
250269,L483586,u7423,m502,MILLER,Goddamn it!
250270,L483567,u7423,m502,MILLER,Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
250271,L483566,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
250272,L483555,u7423,m502,MILLER,FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
250273,L483554,u7424,m502,REIBEN,FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
250274,L483553,u7423,m502,MILLER,Here they come.
250275,L483552,u7423,m502,MILLER,Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
250276,L483537,u7424,m502,REIBEN,That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
250277,L483536,u7423,m502,MILLER,I wonder if his cabin is still available?
250278,L483531,u7423,m502,MILLER,"I coach the baseball team, too."
250279,L483530,u7424,m502,REIBEN,What deal?
250280,L483517,u7423,m502,MILLER,Get back to your positions!
250281,L483516,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
250282,L483483,u7424,m502,REIBEN,OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
250283,L483482,u7423,m502,MILLER,HERE THEY COME!
250284,L483481,u7423,m502,MILLER,Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
250285,L483430,u7423,m502,MILLER,See to it.
250286,L483429,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us."
250287,L483415,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here."
250288,L483414,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Maybe Caen.
250289,L483391,u7423,m502,MILLER,"You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?"
250290,L483390,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir."
250291,L483346,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Have it your way, Captain."
250292,L483345,u7423,m502,MILLER,"You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules."
250293,L483344,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"What if our guys open up, sir?"
250294,L483343,u7423,m502,MILLER,I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
250295,L483339,u7423,m502,MILLER,ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
250296,L483338,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain."
250297,L483334,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits."
250298,L483333,u7423,m502,MILLER,Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
250299,L483322,u7423,m502,MILLER,That's a mystery to me.
250300,L483321,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"No, sir."
250301,L483320,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?"
250302,L483319,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division."
250303,L483318,u7423,m502,MILLER,But we accomplish the mission.
250304,L483317,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him."
250305,L483316,u7423,m502,MILLER,I don't like that one.
250306,L483315,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another."
250307,L483314,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Except for the last part, that one's not bad."
250308,L483313,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive."
250309,L483312,u7423,m502,MILLER,Why's that?
250310,L483311,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead."
250311,L483300,u7423,m502,MILLER,Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
250312,L483299,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I thought you said we had an hour, sir?"
250313,L483298,u7423,m502,MILLER,Up.  We're moving out.
250314,L483255,u7423,m502,MILLER,Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
250315,L483254,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
250316,L483189,u7423,m502,MILLER,We can't leave it here.
250317,L483188,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around."
250318,L483125,u7423,m502,MILLER,"I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead."
250319,L483124,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan."
250320,L483123,u7423,m502,MILLER,Any further thoughts on the subject?
250321,L483121,u7423,m502,MILLER,"But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in..."
250322,L483120,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar."
250323,L483119,u7423,m502,MILLER,"In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance."
250324,L483117,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?"
250325,L483116,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?"
250326,L483101,u7423,m502,MILLER,"You have orders, too."
250327,L483100,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers."
250328,L483095,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck."
250329,L483094,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all."
250330,L483093,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing."
250331,L483092,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine."
250332,L483091,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Huh?
250333,L483090,u7423,m502,MILLER,Ours is not to reason why.
250334,L483089,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?"
250335,L483088,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Sure, what do you want to know?"
250336,L483087,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?"
250337,L483029,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?"
250338,L483028,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Jesus Christ, he's a natural!"
250339,L482961,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance."
250340,L482960,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain."
250341,L482913,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Well, I, for one, like cheese."
250342,L482912,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I'm listening, sir."
250343,L482911,u7423,m502,MILLER,There's always a bright side.
250344,L482910,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side."
250345,L482909,u7423,m502,MILLER,"There's to be a bright side, look for it."
250346,L482908,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead."
250347,L482907,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Yeah, how so?"
250348,L482906,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me."
250349,L482890,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?"
250350,L482889,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Sure, Reiben."
250351,L482888,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Captain, can I ask you a question?"
250352,L482858,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"But, sir..."
250353,L482857,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Trust me, you're the best."
250354,L482856,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?"
250355,L482855,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best."
250356,L482854,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir..."
250357,L482853,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading."
250358,L482797,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy."
250359,L482796,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I don't think so, Captain."
250360,L482793,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private."
250361,L482792,u7423,m502,MILLER,"There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen."
250362,L482791,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion."
250363,L482790,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?"
250364,L482789,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?"
250365,L482788,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen."
250366,L482782,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen."
250367,L482781,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?"
250368,L482745,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork."
250369,L482744,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Captain, can I put in for a transfer?"
250370,L483603,u7423,m502,MILLER,Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
250371,L483602,u7425,m502,RYAN,And Sarge?
250372,L483601,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson."
250373,L483598,u7425,m502,RYAN,Yeah?
250374,L483597,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book."
250375,L483596,u7425,m502,RYAN,"Upham and Jackson, what were they like?"
250376,L483595,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Yes, Private."
250377,L483581,u7423,m502,MILLER,Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
250378,L483580,u7425,m502,RYAN,FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
250379,L483520,u7425,m502,RYAN,"Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside."
250380,L483519,u7423,m502,MILLER,Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
250381,L483496,u7423,m502,MILLER,Struggling with a pair of Germans.
250382,L483495,u7425,m502,RYAN,Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
250383,L483476,u7425,m502,RYAN,"Yes, sir."
250384,L483475,u7423,m502,MILLER,You set?  Sarge nods.
250385,L483463,u7425,m502,RYAN,"I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so..."
250386,L483462,u7423,m502,MILLER,Don't do that again.
250387,L483432,u7423,m502,MILLER,"No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid."
250388,L483431,u7425,m502,RYAN,"I'd like to go, sir."
250389,L483399,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Alright, come with me."
250390,L483398,u7425,m502,RYAN,"Yes, sir."
250391,L483397,u7423,m502,MILLER,"Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?"
250392,L483396,u7425,m502,RYAN,"Thank you, sir."
250393,L483378,u7425,m502,RYAN,"I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving."
250394,L483377,u7423,m502,MILLER,"The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?"
250395,L483374,u7423,m502,MILLER,This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
250396,L483373,u7425,m502,RYAN,"Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks."
250397,L483372,u7423,m502,MILLER,Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
250398,L483110,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that."
250399,L483109,u7429,m502,WADE,"Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for..."
250400,L483085,u7429,m502,WADE,"We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing."
250401,L483084,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it."
250402,L483025,u7429,m502,WADE,"Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining."
250403,L483024,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this."
250404,L483023,u7429,m502,WADE,"Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes."
250405,L483022,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear."
250406,L483019,u7429,m502,WADE,"As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died."
250407,L483018,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again."
250408,L483015,u7429,m502,WADE,"No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things."
250409,L483014,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot."
250410,L483013,u7429,m502,WADE,"So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining."
250411,L483097,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?"
250412,L483096,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother."
250413,L483042,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Captain, he's fast!"
250414,L483041,u7426,m502,SARGE,Damn fool.  Sir.
250415,L482897,u7426,m502,SARGE,What are we likely to run into?
250416,L482896,u7424,m502,REIBEN,I usually like surprises.
250417,L482787,u7426,m502,SARGE,Yeah?  So?
250418,L482786,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Lingerie.
250419,L482785,u7426,m502,SARGE,Frogs?
250420,L482784,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?"
250421,L482783,u7426,m502,SARGE,Who cares?
250422,L482778,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine."
250423,L482777,u7426,m502,SARGE,"Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog."
250424,L482776,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"Shit, sir."
250425,L483543,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"What about you, Captain?"
250426,L483542,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti."
250427,L483250,u7428,m502,UPHAM,Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
250428,L483249,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
250429,L483248,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off."
250430,L483193,u7424,m502,REIBEN,"He's fast, Captain, I saw him."
250431,L483192,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Sir, I ran the 220 in high school."
250432,L482998,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living."
250433,L482997,u7424,m502,REIBEN,We know.
250434,L482996,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men."
250435,L482977,u7424,m502,REIBEN,Get lost.
250436,L482976,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"So, where are you from?"
250437,L483196,u7429,m502,WADE,"Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat."
250438,L483195,u7428,m502,UPHAM,Twenty-four-five.
250439,L483194,u7429,m502,WADE,How fast?
250440,L483021,u7429,m502,WADE,Who knows?  It worked.
250441,L483020,u7428,m502,UPHAM,You think he really believed it?
250442,L483017,u7429,m502,WADE,"It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example..."
250443,L483016,u7428,m502,UPHAM,How do you do it?

250445,L482983,u7428,m502,UPHAM,"Demolition, right?"
250446,L484348,u7430,m503,AGENT,"We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship."

250448,L484346,u7430,m503,AGENT,Because he's guilty.
250449,L484345,u7437,m503,DIANE,"How can you, how can you say that?"
250450,L484344,u7430,m503,AGENT,Don't let your father's business infect your life.
250451,L484343,u7437,m503,DIANE,"You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this."
250452,L484342,u7430,m503,AGENT,"Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?"
250453,L484341,u7437,m503,DIANE,What's the profile?
250454,L484340,u7430,m503,AGENT,"Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile."

250456,L484338,u7430,m503,AGENT,"We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money."

I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent."
250458,L484183,u7440,m503,JIM,"Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it."

250460,L484181,u7440,m503,JIM,That's right.
250461,L484180,u7431,m503,AGENT SIMS,"Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years."
250462,L484179,u7440,m503,JIM,"What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money."
250463,L484178,u7431,m503,AGENT SIMS,"The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family..."

250468,L484050,u7431,m503,AGENT SIMS,So you refuse to answer my questions?
250469,L484049,u7440,m503,JIM,Speak with my lawyer.

250474,L484331,u7440,m503,JIM,Keep it.
250475,L484330,u7432,m503,ASSISTANT,"Okay, thanks."
250476,L484329,u7440,m503,JIM,"Oh yeah, let me give you another card."
250477,L484328,u7432,m503,ASSISTANT,"I'm sorry, but they turned down your card."
250478,L484327,u7440,m503,JIM,"Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?"
250479,L484326,u7432,m503,ASSISTANT,"Thanks, I like yours too."
250480,L484324,u7432,m503,ASSISTANT,Excellent.
250481,L484323,u7440,m503,JIM,I'll take the whole set.
250482,L484322,u7432,m503,ASSISTANT,Good for her.
250483,L484321,u7440,m503,JIM,"Yeah, she won a fellowship."
250484,L484320,u7432,m503,ASSISTANT,For going to school?
250485,L484319,u7440,m503,JIM,"No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter."
250486,L484318,u7432,m503,ASSISTANT,Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together?

250490,L484264,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen."
250491,L483748,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,"Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!"
250492,L483747,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"No, no, don't go in there."
250493,L483710,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,"I just washed this shirt, didn't I?"
250494,L483709,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I'll be in my office.
250495,L483708,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,He's a mess!
250496,L483707,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"You're tough, J-man."
250497,L483688,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,I still am.
250498,L483687,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Yeah.
250499,L483686,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,"I was hilarious once, wasn't I?"
250500,L483685,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M."
250501,L483684,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,"Gee, it's easy."
250502,L483683,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?"
250503,L483682,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
250504,L483677,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!"
250505,L483676,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,"Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know."
250506,L483675,u7442,m503,LLOYD,How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
250507,L483674,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,"Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason."
250508,L483671,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?"
250509,L483670,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,I hope you understand.
250510,L483669,u7442,m503,LLOYD,It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
250511,L483668,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,"I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there."
250512,L483667,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Hey, sis."
250513,L483666,u7433,m503,CONSTANCE,Lloyd?
250514,L484309,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"If she wants me, she can come to me."
250515,L484308,u7434,m503,COREY,The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
250516,L484307,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I am.
250517,L484306,u7434,m503,COREY,"No, you're not a guy."
250518,L484301,u7434,m503,COREY,"Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart."
250519,L484300,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
250520,L484173,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Read it.
250521,L484172,u7434,m503,COREY,What does it say?
250522,L484171,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I already did.
250523,L484170,u7434,m503,COREY,"Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something."
250524,L484169,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Alright.
250525,L484161,u7434,m503,COREY,You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
250526,L484160,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"So, what's your point?"
250527,L484159,u7434,m503,COREY,"Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'."
250528,L484158,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different."
250529,L484154,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I admit nothing.
250530,L484153,u7434,m503,COREY,Did you sleep with her?
250531,L483925,u7434,m503,COREY,See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
250532,L483924,u7442,m503,LLOYD,See you tomorrow.
250533,L483923,u7434,m503,COREY,Yes.
250534,L483922,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Hang in there, man."
250535,L483921,u7434,m503,COREY,"You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person."
250536,L483663,u7434,m503,COREY,"Okay, I got it."
250537,L483662,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
250538,L483661,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here."
250539,L483660,u7434,m503,COREY,That's just so embarrassing.
250540,L483659,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Please?
250541,L483658,u7434,m503,COREY,C'mon Lloyd.
250542,L483657,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"C'mon, just do it."
250543,L483656,u7434,m503,COREY,Lloyd.
250544,L483655,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
250545,L483654,u7434,m503,COREY,"Lloyd, give it up."
250546,L483653,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Look at those eyes.
250547,L483627,u7434,m503,COREY,Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
250548,L483626,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her."
250549,L483623,u7434,m503,COREY,Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
250550,L483622,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I'm gonna call her.
250551,L483621,u7434,m503,COREY,Then what's love?
250552,L483617,u7434,m503,COREY,Going out as friends.
250553,L483616,u7442,m503,LLOYD,What's a scam?
250554,L483615,u7434,m503,COREY,That's not even a scam.
250555,L483614,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event."
250556,L483613,u7434,m503,COREY,But you never had a first date.
250557,L483612,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?"
250558,L483611,u7434,m503,COREY,That's unlikely.
250559,L484175,u7436,m503,DC,I dream about it.
250560,L484174,u7434,m503,COREY,"""Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd.""  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?"
250561,L484168,u7436,m503,DC,"I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants."
250562,L484167,u7434,m503,COREY,"What?  I'm sorry, talk."
250563,L484166,u7436,m503,DC,"You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk."
250564,L484165,u7434,m503,COREY,"And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever..."
250565,L484164,u7436,m503,DC,Wait a minute.
250566,L484163,u7434,m503,COREY,"You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe..."
250567,L484162,u7436,m503,DC,Wait a minute.
250568,L484157,u7436,m503,DC,You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
250569,L484156,u7434,m503,COREY,"Look at his face, he did the deed."
250570,L484155,u7436,m503,DC,"Lloyd, it's us."
250571,L483989,u7434,m503,COREY,He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
250572,L483988,u7436,m503,DC,I told him to be himself.
250573,L483984,u7434,m503,COREY,"Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd."
250574,L483983,u7436,m503,DC,Meaning?
250575,L483982,u7434,m503,COREY,Lloyd is doomed.
250576,L483629,u7434,m503,COREY,"I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt."
250577,L483628,u7436,m503,DC,I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
250578,L483625,u7434,m503,COREY,Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
250579,L483624,u7436,m503,DC,Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
250580,L483608,u7434,m503,COREY,"Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word."
250581,L483607,u7436,m503,DC,He wants to leave things on a good note.
250582,L483606,u7434,m503,COREY,"Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, ""You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll.""  Y'know, it's all so phoney."
250583,L483605,u7436,m503,DC,"Come on, it's graduation."
250584,L483604,u7434,m503,COREY,I don't feel anything.
250585,L483991,u7434,m503,COREY,"If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?"
250586,L483990,u7447,m503,REBECCA,"Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd."
250587,L483987,u7447,m503,REBECCA,What is wrong with this girl?
250588,L483986,u7434,m503,COREY,"It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd."
250589,L483985,u7447,m503,REBECCA,Why?
250590,L483843,u7434,m503,COREY,"Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it."
250591,L483842,u7447,m503,REBECCA,I just saw Joe.  He's here.
250592,L483841,u7434,m503,COREY,"I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight."
250593,L484405,u7435,m503,COURT'S ATTORNEY,Alright.
250594,L484404,u7448,m503,U.S. ATTORNEY,I'll put this past my boss
250595,L484403,u7435,m503,COURT'S ATTORNEY,Confirm this with my office and my client.
250596,L484402,u7448,m503,U.S. ATTORNEY,I can put that together.
250597,L484401,u7435,m503,COURT'S ATTORNEY,He'd like to start serving immediately.
250598,L484400,u7448,m503,U.S. ATTORNEY,And I want to turn the home over to the state.
250599,L484399,u7435,m503,COURT'S ATTORNEY,I can accept that.
250600,L484398,u7448,m503,U.S. ATTORNEY,One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
250601,L484397,u7435,m503,COURT'S ATTORNEY,One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
250602,L484396,u7448,m503,U.S. ATTORNEY,I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
250603,L484305,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride."
250604,L484304,u7436,m503,DC,"Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?"
250605,L484303,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
250606,L484302,u7436,m503,DC,Visit her at the home.
250607,L484299,u7436,m503,DC,"Look, why don't you just call Diane again?"
250608,L484298,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise."
250609,L483610,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
250610,L483609,u7436,m503,DC,"Lloyd, she's being difficult."
250611,L484429,u7437,m503,DIANE,"I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye."
250612,L484428,u7440,m503,JIM,Hi.
250613,L484427,u7437,m503,DIANE,Hello.
250614,L484377,u7437,m503,DIANE,You're right.

250978,L483755,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Whoah, what a day, huh?"
250979,L483754,u7437,m503,DIANE,Thank you very much.
250980,L483753,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible."

250984,L483749,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?"

250986,L483643,u7437,m503,DIANE,Thank-you.  The real world.

250989,L484286,u7438,m503,GUY 2,"Man, you're bringing me down!"
250990,L484285,u7443,m503,MARK,"Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again."
250991,L484284,u7438,m503,GUY 2,"Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that."
250992,L484283,u7443,m503,MARK,"It's your castle, man."
250993,L484271,u7443,m503,MARK,"Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall."
250994,L484270,u7438,m503,GUY 2,"Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind."

250999,L483679,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?"
251000,L483678,u7439,m503,JASON,YEAH!
251001,L483673,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man."
251002,L483672,u7439,m503,JASON,Yeah.
251003,L484426,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing."
251004,L484425,u7440,m503,JIM,Just her name.
251005,L484424,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that."
251006,L484423,u7440,m503,JIM,"She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better."
251007,L484422,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"I know this part, keep reading."
251008,L484421,u7440,m503,JIM,"""You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."""
251009,L484419,u7440,m503,JIM,"I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you."
251010,L484418,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
251011,L484417,u7440,m503,JIM,You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
251012,L484416,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it."
251013,L484415,u7440,m503,JIM,Very talented.
251014,L484414,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I know
251015,L484413,u7440,m503,JIM,She's very successful.
251016,L484412,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I know.
251017,L484411,u7440,m503,JIM,"Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you."
251018,L484410,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way."
251019,L484409,u7440,m503,JIM,Are you?
251020,L484408,u7442,m503,LLOYD,That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
251021,L484407,u7440,m503,JIM,Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
251022,L484406,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um..."
251023,L484312,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?"
251024,L484311,u7440,m503,JIM,"Go ahead, pick it up if you want."
251025,L484310,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call..."
251026,L484043,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter."
251027,L484042,u7440,m503,JIM,"No, really."
251028,L484041,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I'm totally and completely serious.
251029,L484040,u7440,m503,JIM,"Seriously, Lloyd."
251030,L484039,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
251031,L484038,u7440,m503,JIM,Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
251032,L484034,u7440,m503,JIM,"Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars."
251033,L484033,u7442,m503,LLOYD,How do you pay for one of those?
251034,L484032,u7440,m503,JIM,Thanks Lloyd.
251035,L483798,u7440,m503,JIM,Yeah.  Honey?
251036,L483797,u7442,m503,LLOYD,How ya doing?  Is she around?
251037,L483796,u7440,m503,JIM,Fine Lloyd.
251038,L483795,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours."
251039,L483794,u7440,m503,JIM,Hello Lloyd.
251040,L483793,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you."
251041,L483731,u7440,m503,JIM,"Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take..."
251042,L483730,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
251043,L483729,u7440,m503,JIM,"Yeah, she is.  Good luck."
251044,L483728,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"She's really pretty great, isn't she?"
251045,L483727,u7440,m503,JIM,What?
251046,L483726,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?"
251047,L483725,u7440,m503,JIM,"Okay, I'll give here the message."
251048,L483724,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342."
251049,L483723,u7440,m503,JIM,"Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works."
251050,L483722,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall."
251051,L483721,u7440,m503,JIM,The truck?
251052,L483720,u7442,m503,LLOYD,No.
251053,L483719,u7440,m503,JIM,The guy with the Datsun?
251054,L483718,u7442,m503,LLOYD,No.
251055,L483717,u7440,m503,JIM,Is this the guy with the Mustang?
251056,L483716,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Uh... okay... um...
251057,L483715,u7440,m503,JIM,"Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment."
251058,L483714,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
251059,L483713,u7440,m503,JIM,Jim Court?
251060,L484297,u7441,m503,JOE,"Dude, I can't do it!"
251061,L484296,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Diane Court.
251062,L484280,u7441,m503,JOE,Your car?
251063,L484279,u7442,m503,LLOYD,My car.
251064,L483890,u7441,m503,JOE,"Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day."
251065,L483889,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know."
251066,L483888,u7441,m503,JOE,So what's up?
251067,L483887,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
251068,L483867,u7445,m503,MISS EVANS,"Hang tough, Lloyd."
251069,L483866,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know."
251070,L483865,u7445,m503,MISS EVANS,"Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you."
251071,L483862,u7445,m503,MISS EVANS,We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
251072,L483861,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way."
251073,L483860,u7445,m503,MISS EVANS,"Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career."
251074,L483856,u7442,m503,LLOYD,What?
251075,L483855,u7445,m503,MISS EVANS,Lloyd.
251076,L483854,u7442,m503,LLOYD,No way.
251077,L483853,u7445,m503,MISS EVANS,"You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now."
251078,L483852,u7442,m503,LLOYD,How ya doin' Miss Evans?
251079,L483851,u7445,m503,MISS EVANS,"Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you."
251080,L483938,u7444,m503,MIKE,I don't really know where we are.
251081,L483937,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"How you doin', brother?"
251082,L483936,u7444,m503,MIKE,"Ooop, excuse me."
251083,L483840,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Alright.  Key?

251086,L483837,u7444,m503,MIKE,"Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?"
251087,L483836,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I called her up.
251088,L483835,u7444,m503,MIKE,"Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?"
251089,L483834,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Yeah.
251090,L483833,u7444,m503,MIKE,"Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?"
251091,L483832,u7442,m503,LLOYD,What?
251092,L483831,u7444,m503,MIKE,"Mike Cameron, how you doing?"
251093,L483830,u7442,m503,LLOYD,Hey.
251094,L483829,u7444,m503,MIKE,Oh boy.
251095,L483931,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.

251097,L483911,u7449,m503,VALHERE,"Diane, everybody loves that you showed up."
251098,L483910,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something."
251099,L483909,u7449,m503,VALHERE,I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
251100,L483908,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I don't know.
251101,L483907,u7449,m503,VALHERE,"You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?"
251102,L483815,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I was just going to kind of move around.
251103,L483814,u7449,m503,VALHERE,Thanks a lot Lloyd.
251104,L483813,u7442,m503,LLOYD,I was gonna...

251107,L483810,u7449,m503,VALHERE,"Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster."
251108,L483809,u7442,m503,LLOYD,You know Diane Court?
251109,L483808,u7449,m503,VALHERE,"It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?"
251110,L484274,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?"
251111,L484273,u7443,m503,MARK,"Later for you, Luke."
251112,L483920,u7442,m503,LLOYD,"Yeah, alright."
251113,L483919,u7443,m503,MARK,We're full on bonded.

251122,L486268,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you."
251123,L486267,u7450,m504,BRINNLITZ GUY 2,Now you're back.
251124,L486266,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good."
251125,L486265,u7450,m504,BRINNLITZ GUY 2,"Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?"
251126,L486264,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?"
251127,L486263,u7450,m504,BRINNLITZ GUY 2,Oskar - my friend Lena.
251128,L485991,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why."
251129,L485990,u7451,m504,CLERK,The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
251130,L485989,u7451,m504,CLERK,Klaus Tauber.
251131,L485988,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name."
251132,L485987,u7451,m504,CLERK,"Sir, the list is correct."
251133,L485986,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,What's your name?
251134,L485985,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I'm talking to a clerk.
251135,L485984,u7451,m504,CLERK,"He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him."
251136,L485983,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Well, let's find him."
251137,L485982,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,He is.
251138,L485981,u7451,m504,CLERK,Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
251139,L485980,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -"
251140,L485882,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,It's up to you.
251141,L485881,u7452,m504,EMILIE,Should I stay?
251142,L485880,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,It's a beautiful city.
251143,L485879,u7452,m504,EMILIE,Should I stay?
251144,L485878,u7452,m504,EMILIE,I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
251145,L485877,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,What?
251146,L485875,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,War.
251147,L485874,u7452,m504,EMILIE,Luck.
251148,L485872,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,A charade?  How could it be a charade?
251149,L485871,u7452,m504,EMILIE,"It's not a charade, all this?"
251150,L485863,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"You would, though.  That's what I'm saying."
251151,L485862,u7452,m504,EMILIE,I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
251152,L485861,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,What -
251153,L485860,u7452,m504,EMILIE,"Oskar, please -"
251154,L485859,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"You know what, you'd like her."
251155,L486337,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
251156,L486336,u7453,m504,GESTAPO,In Breslau.
251157,L486335,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"All right, okay, let's talk."
251158,L486334,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave."
251159,L486333,u7453,m504,GESTAPO,There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
251160,L486332,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I'm sorry to hear that.
251161,L486331,u7453,m504,GESTAPO,Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
251162,L486477,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
251163,L486476,u7454,m504,GOETH,Where are the guards?
251164,L486286,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
251165,L486285,u7454,m504,GOETH,"Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out."
251166,L486284,u7454,m504,GOETH,"You did, but you didn't."
251167,L486283,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I just told you.
251168,L486282,u7454,m504,GOETH,"If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?"
251169,L486280,u7454,m504,GOETH,"Yeah, sure."
251170,L486279,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy."
251171,L486278,u7454,m504,GOETH,You're not telling me something.
251172,L486277,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Look -
251173,L486276,u7454,m504,GOETH,"Oh, this is ""good business"" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense."
251174,L486275,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,It's good business.
251175,L486274,u7454,m504,GOETH,"What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?"
251176,L486273,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"These people, my people, I want my people."
251177,L486272,u7454,m504,GOETH,You want these people.
251178,L486255,u7454,m504,GOETH,I don't know.  Soon.
251179,L486254,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,When?
251180,L486253,u7454,m504,GOETH,They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
251181,L486252,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,You took my workers.
251182,L486214,u7454,m504,GOETH,"I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something."
251183,L486213,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,What's going on?
251184,L486212,u7454,m504,GOETH,"I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink."
251185,L486096,u7454,m504,GOETH,"I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time."
251186,L486095,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"What do you want for him, I'll give it to you."
251187,L486094,u7454,m504,GOETH,He's important to my business.
251188,L486093,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
251189,L486091,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I pay you too much.
251190,L486090,u7454,m504,GOETH,"It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much."
251191,L486064,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me."
251192,L486063,u7454,m504,GOETH,"Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know."
251193,L486061,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,True.
251194,L486060,u7454,m504,GOETH,That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
251195,L486059,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Yeah, what's that?"
251196,L486058,u7454,m504,GOETH,Scherner told me something else about you.
251197,L486057,u7454,m504,GOETH,"Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business."
251198,L486056,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,It's bad business.
251199,L486055,u7454,m504,GOETH,"We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -"
251200,L486054,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -"
251201,L486053,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,They're mine!
251202,L486052,u7454,m504,GOETH,"They're not gone, they're here."
251203,L486051,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -"
251204,L486049,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know."
251205,L486048,u7454,m504,GOETH,"He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great."
251206,L486047,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,You're kidding.
251207,L486046,u7454,m504,GOETH,"You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner."
251208,L486039,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Good.
251209,L486038,u7454,m504,GOETH,We started without you.
251210,L486321,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
251211,L486320,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,What do I got for you?
251212,L486319,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
251213,L486318,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,Of course I'm on it.
251214,L486317,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,"Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it."
251215,L485820,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,"Yeah, I can."
251216,L485819,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,"Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?"
251217,L485782,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,Look it up.
251218,L485781,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,This is not my problem.
251219,L485780,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,"I asked for metal, you gave me glass."
251220,L485779,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,So I'm responsible for the weather?
251221,L485778,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,"My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload."
251222,L485777,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,You asked for shoe polish.
251223,L485776,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
251224,L485775,u7455,m504,GOLDBERG,What's that?
251225,L485925,u7456,m504,LOWENSTEIN,You're a good man.
251226,L485924,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Yeah, okay."
251227,L485923,u7456,m504,LOWENSTEIN,"God bless you, sir."
251228,L485922,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"That's great, thanks."
251229,L485921,u7456,m504,LOWENSTEIN,I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
251230,L485920,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,That's great.
251231,L485919,u7456,m504,LOWENSTEIN,"The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you."
251232,L485918,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job."
251233,L485917,u7456,m504,LOWENSTEIN,"I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work."
251234,L486527,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat."
251235,L486526,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,"I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over."
251236,L486525,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
251237,L486524,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
251238,L486523,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink."
251239,L486522,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,What are you doing?
251240,L486521,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Things are great, things are great."
251241,L486520,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,Good.  How's it going?
251242,L486394,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
251243,L486393,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,What's wrong with it?
251244,L485904,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,She's good.
251245,L485903,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?"
251246,L485902,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,Yeah.
251247,L485901,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"How you feeling, all right?"
251248,L485794,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays."
251249,L485793,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,How many?
251250,L485792,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Nice things cost money.
251251,L485791,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
251252,L485790,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,There's nothing in the stores.
251253,L485789,u7457,m504,PFEFFERBERG,Like this?
251254,L486451,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful."
251255,L486450,u7458,m504,RASCH,Pistols?
251256,L486449,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,It kind of looks that way.
251257,L486448,u7458,m504,RASCH,"We're losing the war, aren't we."
251258,L486447,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
251259,L486442,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Wine?
251260,L486441,u7458,m504,RASCH,"Oh, God, you don't have a drink?"
251261,L486440,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I need a drink.
251262,L486439,u7458,m504,RASCH,Thank you.
251263,L486437,u7458,m504,RASCH,How do you do?
251264,L486436,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie."
251265,L486435,u7458,m504,RASCH,"Oskar, good of you to come."
251266,L486200,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
251267,L486199,u7459,m504,SCHERNER,"He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us."
251268,L486194,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?"
251269,L486193,u7459,m504,SCHERNER,"He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -"
251270,L486192,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,So I'll talk to him about it.
251271,L486191,u7459,m504,SCHERNER,The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
251272,L485847,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time."
251273,L485846,u7459,m504,SCHERNER,That'd be fine.
251274,L485844,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
251275,L485843,u7459,m504,SCHERNER,What others?
251276,L485842,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays."
251277,L485841,u7459,m504,SCHERNER,"I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -"
251278,L486498,u7461,m504,STERN,You did so much.
251279,L486497,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I didn't do enough.
251280,L486496,u7461,m504,STERN,There will be generations because of what you did.
251281,L486495,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ..."
251282,L486494,u7461,m504,STERN,"Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them."
251283,L486493,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more..."
251284,L486456,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"No, no, what, what is it?"
251285,L486455,u7461,m504,STERN,I'll talk to you later.
251286,L486411,u7461,m504,STERN,You'll lose money.
251287,L486410,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
251288,L486409,u7461,m504,STERN,"I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference."
251289,L486406,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,No?
251290,L486405,u7461,m504,STERN,There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
251291,L486404,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days."
251292,L486403,u7461,m504,STERN,They're withholding payment.
251293,L486402,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter."
251294,L486399,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"They arrived, can you believe it?"
251295,L486398,u7461,m504,STERN,They arrived.
251296,L486397,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Stern.
251297,L486396,u7461,m504,STERN,We need to talk.
251298,L486389,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Yes.
251299,L486388,u7461,m504,STERN,That's very generous of you.
251300,L486299,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them."
251301,L486298,u7461,m504,STERN,"Eight hundred, give or take."
251302,L486295,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,More.
251303,L486294,u7461,m504,STERN,"Four hundred, four fifty -"
251304,L486188,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it."
251305,L486187,u7461,m504,STERN,I think it's too late.
251306,L486186,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I'll talk to him.
251307,L486161,u7461,m504,STERN,There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
251308,L486160,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?"
251309,L486159,u7461,m504,STERN,And killing.
251310,L486158,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money..."
251311,L486157,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally."
251312,L486156,u7461,m504,STERN,What other point is -
251313,L486155,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point."
251314,L486154,u7461,m504,STERN,Are you losing money?
251315,L486153,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
251316,L486103,u7461,m504,STERN,Oskar -
251317,L486102,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"I got to go, I'll see you."
251318,L486101,u7461,m504,STERN,Thank you.
251319,L486100,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something."
251320,L485955,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Ah, yes."
251321,L485954,u7461,m504,STERN,Christmas presents.
251322,L485953,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?"
251323,L485932,u7461,m504,STERN,Do what?
251324,L485931,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Don't ever do that to me again.
251325,L485914,u7461,m504,STERN,There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
251326,L485913,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,What?
251327,L485912,u7461,m504,STERN,The war could end.
251328,L485911,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Any reason to think next month will be worse?
251329,L485910,u7461,m504,STERN,Yes.
251330,L485909,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Better this month than last?
251331,L485908,u7461,m504,STERN,Yes.
251332,L485907,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
251333,L485833,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
251334,L485832,u7461,m504,STERN,"The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing."
251335,L485831,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?"
251336,L485774,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,They should be.
251337,L485773,u7461,m504,STERN,I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
251338,L485772,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Something they can hold in their hands.
251339,L485771,u7461,m504,STERN,Pots and pans.
251340,L485770,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy."
251341,L485769,u7461,m504,STERN,"Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale."
251342,L485768,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Jews, yeah.  Investors."
251343,L485766,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard."
251344,L485765,u7461,m504,STERN,"Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a ""pleasure."""
251345,L485763,u7461,m504,STERN,I think most people right now have other priorities.
251346,L485762,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?"
251347,L485759,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?"
251348,L485758,u7461,m504,STERN,I was just the accountant.
251349,L486196,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy."
251350,L486195,u7462,m504,TOFFEL,"He's stealing from you, Oskar."
251351,L486190,u7462,m504,TOFFEL,"There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money."
251352,L486189,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us."
251353,L485942,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,"He was a metal press operator, quite skilled."
251354,L485941,u7462,m504,TOFFEL,"A one-armed machinist, Oskar?"
251355,L485939,u7462,m504,TOFFEL,No.
251356,L485938,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,Would it do any good?
251357,L485937,u7462,m504,TOFFEL,"File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right."
251358,L485936,u7460,m504,SCHINDLER,I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
251359,L485935,u7462,m504,TOFFEL,"It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow."
251360,L488214,u7469,m505,DEWEY,"That doesn't work, sir."
251361,L488213,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
251362,L488197,u7469,m505,DEWEY,What now?
251363,L488196,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,"No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move."
251364,L488195,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Can't we hold him?
251365,L488024,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,"37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless."
251366,L488023,u7469,m505,DEWEY,How's the name search going?
251367,L488021,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,"Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off..."
251368,L488020,u7469,m505,DEWEY,"I can do it, Captain."
251369,L487919,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,We're aware of that.
251370,L487918,u7469,m505,DEWEY,The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
251371,L487917,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,"We know that, son."
251372,L488170,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,On national television.
251373,L488169,u7483,m505,SHERIFF,I would say we are now officially baffled.
251374,L488168,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,"Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person."
251375,L488167,u7483,m505,SHERIFF,You're sure about this two person thing?
251376,L488166,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,They've broken their pattern.
251377,L488165,u7483,m505,SHERIFF,He's broken his pattern.
251378,L487936,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
251379,L487935,u7483,m505,SHERIFF,Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
251380,L487914,u7483,m505,SHERIFF,The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
251381,L487913,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
251382,L487887,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,Take the neighborhood.
251383,L487886,u7483,m505,SHERIFF,"Attic, garage, basement, nothing."
251384,L487885,u7463,m505,CAPTAIN TYLER,Have you checked the...
251385,L487830,u7464,m505,CICI,"Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back."

251398,L487811,u7471,m505,GIRL ON PHONE,What is it?
251399,L487810,u7464,m505,CICI,Shit.
251400,L487809,u7471,m505,GIRL ON PHONE,It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
251401,L487808,u7464,m505,CICI,"No, some creep asshole trying to scare me."
251402,L487787,u7464,m505,CICI,"Alright, alright...I'll call you back."
251403,L487786,u7471,m505,GIRL ON PHONE,Don't. Think Bailey.
251404,L487785,u7464,m505,CICI,I won't.
251405,L487784,u7471,m505,GIRL ON PHONE,That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
251406,L487777,u7464,m505,CICI,"No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week..."
251407,L487776,u7471,m505,GIRL ON PHONE,thought he was doing AA.
251408,L487775,u7464,m505,CICI,"No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore."
251409,L487862,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,Don't forget to set the alarm.
251410,L487861,u7464,m505,CICI,WHAAAATT?

251413,L487803,u7464,m505,CICI,"I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?"
251414,L487802,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,I'm inquisitive.
251415,L487801,u7464,m505,CICI,Why do you always answer a question with a question?
251416,L487800,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,Why would you wanna do that?
251417,L487799,u7464,m505,CICI,What if I said goodbye?
251418,L487798,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,What if I said you?

251420,L487796,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,That's too bad.
251421,L487795,u7464,m505,CICI,I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
251422,L487794,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,Why aren't you there?
251423,L487793,u7464,m505,CICI,We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.

251425,L487791,u7464,m505,CICI,Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
251426,L487790,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,That's okay.
251427,L487789,u7464,m505,CICI,"Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else."
251428,L487783,u7464,m505,CICI,Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
251429,L487782,u7476,m505,MAN'S VOICE,Someone who wants to talk to you.

251434,L487853,u7466,m505,DAWNIE,"Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room."
251435,L487847,u7464,m505,CICI,Just some asshole trying to scare me.
251436,L487846,u7466,m505,DAWNIE,I had to change. Did anyone call?
251437,L487845,u7464,m505,CICI,I thought you were going to the mixer?
251438,L487844,u7466,m505,DAWNIE,I live here.
251439,L487843,u7464,m505,CICI,"Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?"
251440,L488489,u7465,m505,COTTON,Not until youre dead.
251441,L488488,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"Its over, Cotton."
251442,L488487,u7465,m505,COTTON,I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
251443,L488486,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"Please, Cotton, dont do this."
251444,L488485,u7465,m505,COTTON,"Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim."
251445,L488108,u7465,m505,COTTON,You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
251446,L488107,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,What?
251447,L488106,u7465,m505,COTTON,It helped me realize one thing.
251448,L488105,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,Did it?
251449,L488104,u7465,m505,COTTON,"I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help."
251450,L488103,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist."
251451,L488102,u7465,m505,COTTON,"I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads."
251452,L488101,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
251453,L488100,u7465,m505,COTTON,You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
251454,L488099,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,I did that.
251455,L488098,u7465,m505,COTTON,You could start with an apology.
251456,L488097,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"What do you want from me, Cotton?"
251457,L488096,u7465,m505,COTTON,"Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings."
251458,L488095,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,I don't think that's a good idea.
251459,L488094,u7465,m505,COTTON,Can we talk?
251460,L488093,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,Cotton.
251461,L488208,u7465,m505,COTTON,"Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes."
251462,L488207,u7470,m505,GALE,"Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far."
251463,L488206,u7465,m505,COTTON,"You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?"
251464,L488205,u7470,m505,GALE,"Cotton, I've done nothing but help you."
251465,L488204,u7465,m505,COTTON,"No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that."
251466,L488203,u7470,m505,GALE,You have a right to be angry.
251467,L488202,u7465,m505,COTTON,"Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?"
251468,L488201,u7470,m505,GALE,Did you do it?
251469,L488200,u7465,m505,COTTON,"You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?"
251470,L488476,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,Enter Cotton Weary.

251472,L488474,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,Finish what my son started.
251473,L488473,u7470,m505,GALE,What are you going to do?
251474,L488466,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
251475,L488465,u7470,m505,GALE,"Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son."
251476,L488460,u7470,m505,GALE,Youre all in this together?
251477,L488459,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
251478,L487977,u7470,m505,GALE,"Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me."
251479,L487976,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
251480,L487975,u7470,m505,GALE,"No, I don't."
251481,L487974,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,"Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?"
251482,L487973,u7470,m505,GALE,Why don't you ask them?
251483,L487972,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,And are the police sure about that?
251484,L487971,u7470,m505,GALE,Home--where he lives.
251485,L487970,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,Where is Sidney's father?
251486,L487969,u7470,m505,GALE,Tons and tons.
251487,L487968,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,"Hi, Gale, any leads?"
251488,L487703,u7470,m505,GALE,Good for you.
251489,L487702,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
251490,L487701,u7470,m505,GALE,Do I know you? You look familiar.
251491,L487700,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,And much richer as a result.
251492,L487699,u7470,m505,GALE,"Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter."
251493,L487698,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
251494,L487697,u7470,m505,GALE,Fair enough.
251495,L487696,u7467,m505,DEBBIE SALT,"Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?"
251496,L487695,u7470,m505,GALE,"Look, I'm sorry about the face."
251497,L488230,u7478,m505,MICKEY,You freakin?
251498,L488229,u7468,m505,DEREK,Yeah.
251499,L488228,u7478,m505,MICKEY,No way.
251500,L488227,u7468,m505,DEREK,She dumped me.
251501,L488226,u7478,m505,MICKEY,Where's Sid?
251502,L488225,u7468,m505,DEREK,Not one bit.
251503,L488224,u7478,m505,MICKEY,Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
251504,L488075,u7468,m505,DEREK,Definitely Whitney.
251505,L488074,u7478,m505,MICKEY,"""And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."""
251506,L488073,u7468,m505,DEREK,I think he's doing Dolly.
251507,L488061,u7468,m505,DEREK,Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
251508,L488060,u7478,m505,MICKEY,I could use some therapy.
251509,L488039,u7468,m505,DEREK,I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
251510,L488038,u7478,m505,MICKEY,What's your subject?
251511,L488037,u7468,m505,DEREK,My documentary is due on Tuesday.
251512,L487732,u7478,m505,MICKEY,"Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie..."
251513,L487731,u7468,m505,DEREK,How do you put up with this Greek shit?
251514,L488447,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
251515,L488446,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth."
251516,L488413,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,Youre not going to get away with this.
251517,L488412,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?"
251518,L488393,u7468,m505,DEREK,Good question. You took the bait.
251519,L488392,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,Why?
251520,L488381,u7468,m505,DEREK,Thats quick.
251521,L488380,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,No. This is a set up.
251522,L488379,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Go on, untie him."
251523,L488124,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise."
251524,L488123,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men."
251525,L488122,u7468,m505,DEREK,"I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me."
251526,L488121,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"No, it's not."
251527,L488120,u7468,m505,DEREK,I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
251528,L487966,u7468,m505,DEREK,It's under control.
251529,L487965,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
251530,L487964,u7468,m505,DEREK,Let us decide that.
251531,L487963,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
251532,L487960,u7468,m505,DEREK,I think it's out of your control.
251533,L487959,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,This is exactly what I don't want.
251534,L487892,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,I'll get my jacket.
251535,L487891,u7468,m505,DEREK,Lemme take you home.
251536,L487877,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,The forbidden subject.
251537,L487876,u7468,m505,DEREK,About what?
251538,L487871,u7468,m505,DEREK,I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
251539,L487870,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
251540,L487729,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Sid, you don't have to."
251541,L487728,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
251542,L487688,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
251543,L487687,u7468,m505,DEREK,"I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?"
251544,L487686,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"I skipped. Too many ""That's her"" looks."
251545,L487685,u7468,m505,DEREK,How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
251546,L488462,u7472,m505,HALLIE,Tuitions expensive.
251547,L488461,u7468,m505,DEREK,We had to have financing.
251548,L488430,u7472,m505,HALLIE,Tails.
251549,L488429,u7468,m505,DEREK,Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
251550,L488428,u7472,m505,HALLIE,"Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip."
251551,L488427,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Just for you, Sid."
251552,L488426,u7472,m505,HALLIE,We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
251553,L488425,u7468,m505,DEREK,Or it found us.
251554,L488424,u7472,m505,HALLIE,So we found a compromise.
251555,L488423,u7468,m505,DEREK,"And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth."
251556,L488422,u7472,m505,HALLIE,..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
251557,L488421,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done."
251558,L488420,u7472,m505,HALLIE,A twist ending if you will.
251559,L488419,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you."
251560,L488418,u7472,m505,HALLIE,"And now, drum roll please..."
251561,L488417,u7468,m505,DEREK,Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
251562,L488416,u7472,m505,HALLIE,A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
251563,L488415,u7468,m505,DEREK,"The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II."
251564,L488414,u7472,m505,HALLIE,Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
251565,L488409,u7468,m505,DEREK,Until now.
251566,L488408,u7472,m505,HALLIE,Youre the one who got away.
251567,L488407,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented."
251568,L488406,u7472,m505,HALLIE,We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
251569,L488405,u7468,m505,DEREK,"I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line..."
251570,L488404,u7472,m505,HALLIE,He sent me the cutest e-mail.
251571,L488397,u7468,m505,DEREK,I find his work overwrought.
251572,L488396,u7472,m505,HALLIE,He hates Oliver Stone.
251573,L488395,u7468,m505,DEREK,"I really dont like that comparison, honey."
251574,L488394,u7472,m505,HALLIE,"Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on."
251575,L488391,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?"
251576,L488390,u7472,m505,HALLIE,"Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive."
251577,L488388,u7472,m505,HALLIE,I got it..
251578,L488387,u7468,m505,DEREK,"Need some help, honey."
251579,L488063,u7468,m505,DEREK,Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
251580,L488062,u7472,m505,HALLIE,He seemed harmless.
251581,L488051,u7472,m505,HALLIE,Randy somebody.
251582,L488050,u7468,m505,DEREK,What guy?
251583,L488049,u7472,m505,HALLIE,She's got guards with her.
251584,L488046,u7472,m505,HALLIE,I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
251585,L488045,u7468,m505,DEREK,You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
251586,L488044,u7472,m505,HALLIE,Damned if I know. She ditched me.
251587,L488043,u7468,m505,DEREK,Where's Sid?
251588,L487953,u7468,m505,DEREK,And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
251589,L487952,u7472,m505,HALLIE,So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
251590,L487951,u7468,m505,DEREK,Two.
251591,L488327,u7469,m505,DEWEY,There's nothing. I'm coming down.
251592,L488326,u7470,m505,GALE,Dewey?
251593,L488323,u7469,m505,DEWEY,"No, wait here."
251594,L488322,u7470,m505,GALE,Let's go.
251595,L488318,u7469,m505,DEWEY,He filmed his victims.
251596,L488317,u7470,m505,GALE,Jesus Christ!
251597,L488314,u7469,m505,DEWEY,C'mon. Let's go.
251598,L488313,u7470,m505,GALE,Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
251599,L488311,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Over here.
251600,L488310,u7470,m505,GALE,This is all too familiar.
251601,L488309,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Let's find out.
251602,L488308,u7470,m505,GALE,Ssshh! What was that?
251603,L488292,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Hallie?
251604,L488291,u7470,m505,GALE,Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
251605,L488290,u7469,m505,DEWEY,The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
251606,L488289,u7470,m505,GALE,And Joel's pre-med.
251607,L488288,u7469,m505,DEWEY,They're roomates.
251608,L488286,u7469,m505,DEWEY,We'd break some furniture.
251609,L488285,u7470,m505,GALE,..and as lonely as I am...
251610,L488284,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
251611,L488283,u7470,m505,GALE,"Dewey, you and I would never make it."
251612,L488282,u7469,m505,DEWEY,And it's sexier in the dark.
251613,L488281,u7469,m505,DEWEY,That's not the way it's done.
251614,L488280,u7470,m505,GALE,Can we turn the light on?
251615,L488279,u7469,m505,DEWEY,A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
251616,L488278,u7470,m505,GALE,What are we looking for?
251617,L488277,u7469,m505,DEWEY,You broke my heart.
251618,L488271,u7470,m505,GALE,Billy had alibis too.
251619,L488270,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
251620,L488269,u7470,m505,GALE,He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
251621,L488268,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Meaning?
251622,L488267,u7470,m505,GALE,"If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?"
251623,L488194,u7469,m505,DEWEY,Not good.
251624,L488193,u7470,m505,GALE,Not good. How you doin?
251625,L488135,u7469,m505,DEWEY,"I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled."
251626,L488134,u7470,m505,GALE,Yeah?
251627,L488133,u7469,m505,DEWEY,I know that.
251628,L488132,u7470,m505,GALE,"And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit."
251629,L488131,u7469,m505,DEWEY,I think you're all an act.
251630,L488130,u7469,m505,DEWEY,You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
251631,L488129,u7470,m505,GALE,Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
251632,L488128,u7469,m505,DEWEY,So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
251633,L487751,u7469,m505,DEWEY,"No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do."
251634,L487750,u7470,m505,GALE,I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
251635,L487749,u7469,m505,DEWEY,How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
251636,L487748,u7470,m505,GALE,I never meant to imply...
251637,L487747,u7469,m505,DEWEY,"Page 41. ""Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."""

251645,L487739,u7469,m505,DEWEY,"Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears."

251667,L487640,u7469,m505,DEWEY,They thought it was a publicity stunt.

251750,L487604,u7473,m505,IN THE THEATER,"The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight."
251751,L487603,u7480,m505,ON SCREEN,The young girl is slashed again.
251752,L487602,u7473,m505,IN THE THEATER,"Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS ""Sit down."" Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised."

251831,L488115,u7482,m505,RANDY,I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
251832,L488114,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
251833,L488113,u7482,m505,RANDY,If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
251834,L488017,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,"Me, too. Randy. Me too."
251835,L488016,u7482,m505,RANDY,"Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing."
251836,L488015,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,Do you work for her now?
251837,L488014,u7482,m505,RANDY,"I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me."
251838,L488013,u7484,m505,SIDNEY,What do you want?
251839,L488596,u7486,m506,ANGELINA,"No, the other one. The one who played his wife."
251840,L488595,u7499,m506,TYSON,Melinda McGraw?
251841,L488594,u7486,m506,ANGELINA,There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
251842,L488589,u7499,m506,TYSON,And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
251843,L488588,u7486,m506,ANGELINA,Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
251844,L488587,u7499,m506,TYSON,Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
251845,L488586,u7486,m506,ANGELINA,I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
251846,L488506,u7487,m506,BEN,"Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . ."
251847,L488505,u7489,m506,CHRISTINE,"I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie."
251848,L488504,u7487,m506,BEN,Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
251849,L488503,u7489,m506,CHRISTINE,All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
251850,L488502,u7487,m506,BEN,"Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty."
251851,L488501,u7489,m506,CHRISTINE,"No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes."
251852,L488553,u7487,m506,BEN,Reaction to what?
251853,L488552,u7500,m506,VOICE,To see your reaction.
251854,L488551,u7487,m506,BEN,Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
251855,L488550,u7500,m506,VOICE,Closer than you think.
251856,L488549,u7487,m506,BEN,Where are you?
251857,L488548,u7500,m506,VOICE,"Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly."
251858,L488547,u7487,m506,BEN,Yeah.
251859,L488545,u7500,m506,VOICE,"No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?"
251860,L488544,u7487,m506,BEN,I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
251861,L488543,u7500,m506,VOICE,You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
251862,L488541,u7500,m506,VOICE,Good bye Ben.
251863,L488540,u7487,m506,BEN,What?!
251864,L488539,u7500,m506,VOICE,That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
251865,L488538,u7487,m506,BEN,What?! But I did everything you said to do!
251866,L488537,u7500,m506,VOICE,Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
251867,L488536,u7487,m506,BEN,It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
251868,L488534,u7500,m506,VOICE,"Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?"
251869,L488533,u7487,m506,BEN,I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
251870,L488532,u7500,m506,VOICE,"You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies."
251871,L488531,u7487,m506,BEN,What kind of a game?
251872,L488530,u7500,m506,VOICE,More of a game really.
251873,L488529,u7487,m506,BEN,"Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?"
251874,L488528,u7500,m506,VOICE,"I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife."
251875,L488527,u7487,m506,BEN,What do you mean?
251876,L488526,u7500,m506,VOICE,Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
251877,L488525,u7487,m506,BEN,Thanks.
251878,L488524,u7500,m506,VOICE,Really? You're such a talented actor.
251879,L488523,u7487,m506,BEN,Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
251880,L488522,u7500,m506,VOICE,You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
251881,L488520,u7500,m506,VOICE,But your voice sounds so familiar.
251882,L488519,u7487,m506,BEN,"Asshole, Can't talk."
251883,L488518,u7500,m506,VOICE,"Wait, wait. Don't hang up."
251884,L488517,u7487,m506,BEN,"Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later."
251885,L488516,u7500,m506,VOICE,Do I?
251886,L488515,u7487,m506,BEN,"I think you got the wrong number, buddy."
251887,L488514,u7500,m506,VOICE,I don't know.
251888,L488513,u7487,m506,BEN,Well what number are you trying to reach?
251889,L488512,u7500,m506,VOICE,Who is this?
251890,L488511,u7487,m506,BEN,Who is this?
251891,L488510,u7500,m506,VOICE,Hello.
251892,L488509,u7487,m506,BEN,Jesus.  Hello?
251893,L488947,u7488,m506,BIANCA,Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
251894,L488946,u7492,m506,GALE,"What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?"
251895,L488943,u7488,m506,BIANCA,"Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will."
251896,L488942,u7492,m506,GALE,It may be Maureen Reynolds --
251897,L488941,u7488,m506,BIANCA,"I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --"
251898,L488936,u7492,m506,GALE,"Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?"
251899,L488935,u7488,m506,BIANCA,"Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?"
251900,L488934,u7492,m506,GALE,Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
251901,L488933,u7488,m506,BIANCA,Nope.
251902,L488932,u7492,m506,GALE,Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
251903,L488931,u7488,m506,BIANCA,I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
251904,L488930,u7492,m506,GALE,"I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?"
251905,L488929,u7488,m506,BIANCA,Can I help you?
251906,L489067,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now."
251907,L489066,u7492,m506,GALE,He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
251908,L489065,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,Jesus Gale what happened?
251909,L488853,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?"
251910,L488852,u7492,m506,GALE,"Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!"
251911,L488841,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too."
251912,L488840,u7492,m506,GALE,"OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott."
251913,L488837,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count."
251914,L488836,u7492,m506,GALE,Four? There are five.
251915,L488833,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something"
251916,L488832,u7492,m506,GALE,"But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!"
251917,L488831,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder."
251918,L488715,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?"
251919,L488714,u7492,m506,GALE,"Please, call me Gale."
251920,L488713,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
251921,L488712,u7492,m506,GALE,But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
251922,L488711,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
251923,L488710,u7492,m506,GALE,Who?
251924,L488709,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried."
251925,L488708,u7492,m506,GALE,"Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?"
251926,L488707,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway."
251927,L488635,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there."
251928,L488634,u7492,m506,GALE,Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
251929,L488633,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers."
251930,L488632,u7492,m506,GALE,"Alright Kincaid, no where to?"
251931,L488579,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,And who would that be?
251932,L488578,u7492,m506,GALE,"I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk."
251933,L488577,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger."
251934,L488576,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,There's more.
251935,L488575,u7492,m506,GALE,That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
251936,L488574,u7492,m506,GALE,A note?
251937,L488573,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note."
251938,L488572,u7492,m506,GALE,"So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?"
251939,L488571,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
251940,L488570,u7492,m506,GALE,"Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI."
251941,L488569,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?"
251942,L488568,u7492,m506,GALE,Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
251943,L489033,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Catch him, or kill him."
251944,L489032,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Oh yeah, how?"
251945,L489031,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that."
251946,L489030,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,How is that good news?
251947,L489029,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news."
251948,L489028,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it."
251949,L489027,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,What did you know about your mother?
251950,L489026,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Hmm.
251951,L489025,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott."
251952,L489024,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts."
251953,L489023,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone."
251954,L489022,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,What do you mean?
251955,L489021,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that."
251956,L489020,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Excuse me?
251957,L489019,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,To me Hollywood is about death.
251958,L489018,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people."
251959,L489017,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios."
251960,L489016,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Did you request this case?
251961,L489015,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off."
251962,L489014,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective."
251963,L489013,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney."
251964,L489012,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"You seem to like movies, Detective."
251965,L489011,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"You mean like, movie trilogies?"
251966,L489010,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,What do you know about trilogies?
251967,L488887,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Absolutely.
251968,L488886,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,Are you sure?
251969,L488883,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?"
251970,L488882,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother."
251971,L488980,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe."
251972,L488979,u7491,m506,DEWEY,And what made you think it was Sidney?
251973,L488978,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked."
251974,L488876,u7491,m506,DEWEY,No.
251975,L488875,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
251976,L488874,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?"
251977,L488871,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,What?  When?
251978,L488870,u7491,m506,DEWEY,The killer called her.
251979,L488869,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Nice to finally meet you, Sidney."
251980,L488864,u7491,m506,DEWEY,There's someone here who wants to help.
251981,L488863,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,What Rielly?
251982,L488862,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Detective Kincaid?
251983,L488851,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Is that a threat?
251984,L488850,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"When it's a threat, you'll know it."
251985,L488849,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Is that a threat, Detective?"
251986,L488846,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
251987,L488845,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
251988,L488844,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What does this have to do with Sid?
251989,L488843,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point."
251990,L488839,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there."
251991,L488838,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
251992,L488835,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities."
251993,L488834,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it."
251994,L488615,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
251995,L488614,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,"That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant."
251996,L488608,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Yeah. A real tragedy.
251997,L488607,u7490,m506,DETECTIVE KINCAID,Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
251998,L489166,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
251999,L489165,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
252000,L489163,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
252001,L489162,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
252002,L489161,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
252003,L489133,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
252004,L489132,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,They've got her!
252005,L489131,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Where's Gale?
252006,L489115,u7491,m506,DEWEY,I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
252007,L489114,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Where are you Dewey?
252008,L489113,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Sid I can see you!
252009,L489112,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
252010,L489111,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
252011,L489110,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Yeah?
252012,L488960,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
252013,L488959,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Don't worry, I've got a permit for it."
252014,L488952,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
252015,L488951,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?"
252016,L488950,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
252017,L488908,u7491,m506,DEWEY,No.
252018,L488907,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,I can see nothing's changed.
252019,L488893,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
252020,L488892,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
252021,L488889,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro."
252022,L488888,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night."
252023,L488885,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down."
252024,L488884,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding."
252025,L488861,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Follow me.
252026,L488860,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
252027,L488859,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What?
252028,L488858,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
252029,L488857,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
252030,L489170,u7492,m506,GALE,"Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly."
252031,L489169,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing."
252032,L489058,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Who is it?
252033,L489057,u7492,m506,GALE,"Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is."
252034,L488967,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Nevermind, what'd you two find?"
252035,L488966,u7492,m506,GALE,"Sidney, what happened?"
252036,L488906,u7492,m506,GALE,I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
252037,L488905,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Do you want us to come with you?
252038,L488904,u7492,m506,GALE,"I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later."
252039,L488880,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Just Jennifer.  And you.
252040,L488879,u7492,m506,GALE,Has anyone else every used your phone?
252041,L488878,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do."
252042,L488877,u7492,m506,GALE,Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
252043,L488868,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Sid, this is detective Kincaid."
252044,L488867,u7492,m506,GALE,Thank you.
252045,L488825,u7491,m506,DEWEY,GALE BEHIND YOU!
252046,L488824,u7492,m506,GALE,What?
252047,L488823,u7491,m506,DEWEY,OH. OH GOD. GALE --
252048,L488805,u7492,m506,GALE,"Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!"
252049,L488804,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
252050,L488774,u7492,m506,GALE,Fuck!
252051,L488773,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Gale, your engine's still running."
252052,L488772,u7492,m506,GALE,"Neither are you, Magnum P.I."
252053,L488771,u7491,m506,DEWEY,You're not a detective.
252054,L488770,u7492,m506,GALE,I happen to work for the police god dammit!
252055,L488769,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Stop following me.
252056,L488768,u7491,m506,DEWEY,I'm on duty.
252057,L488767,u7492,m506,GALE,"Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?"
252058,L488766,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Jennifer needs me.
252059,L488765,u7492,m506,GALE,And who is that?
252060,L488764,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person."
252061,L488763,u7492,m506,GALE,Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?
252062,L488762,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
252063,L488761,u7492,m506,GALE,"I'm sorry, this is too good!"
252064,L488760,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything."
252065,L488759,u7492,m506,GALE,Someone stole Sid's file?
252066,L488758,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked."
252067,L488757,u7492,m506,GALE,And?
252068,L488756,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research."
252069,L488755,u7492,m506,GALE,Always.
252070,L488754,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Off the record.
252071,L488753,u7492,m506,GALE,"All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?"
252072,L488752,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you."
252073,L488751,u7492,m506,GALE,"Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?"
252074,L488750,u7491,m506,DEWEY,You used to say that was our strength.
252075,L488749,u7492,m506,GALE,"It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different."
252076,L488748,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
252077,L488747,u7492,m506,GALE,It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
252078,L488746,u7491,m506,DEWEY,So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
252079,L488745,u7492,m506,GALE,"You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else."
252080,L488744,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What about me?
252081,L488743,u7492,m506,GALE,"Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?"
252082,L488742,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Why would the police come to you?
252083,L488741,u7492,m506,GALE,"Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS."
252084,L488740,u7491,m506,DEWEY,Do you really mean it this time Gale?
252085,L488739,u7492,m506,GALE,This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
252086,L488738,u7491,m506,DEWEY,You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
252087,L488737,u7492,m506,GALE,"Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past."
252088,L488736,u7491,m506,DEWEY,They found another note?
252089,L488611,u7492,m506,GALE,Show him.
252090,L488610,u7491,m506,DEWEY,What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
252091,L488609,u7492,m506,GALE,"Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is."
252092,L488999,u7494,m506,MILTON,"When we did the first 'Stab"" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?"
252093,L488998,u7491,m506,DEWEY,But you know who she was.
252094,L488997,u7494,m506,MILTON,"What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out."
252095,L488994,u7494,m506,MILTON,I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
252096,L488993,u7491,m506,DEWEY,"No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call."
252097,L488992,u7494,m506,MILTON,What's your point?
252098,L488985,u7494,m506,MILTON,"Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio."
252099,L488984,u7491,m506,DEWEY,So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
252100,L488567,u7495,m506,ROMAN,Sure.
252101,L488566,u7492,m506,GALE,Would you excuse me for a moment?
252102,L488565,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick."
252103,L488564,u7492,m506,GALE,Your life?
252104,L488563,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Honestly, my life."
252105,L488562,u7492,m506,GALE,"Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?"
252106,L488561,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet."
252107,L488560,u7492,m506,GALE,"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman."
252108,L488559,u7495,m506,ROMAN,Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
252109,L489042,u7492,m506,GALE,"Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus."
252110,L489041,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
252111,L489040,u7492,m506,GALE,Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
252112,L489039,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
252113,L488996,u7492,m506,GALE,Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
252114,L488995,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,"Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!"
252115,L488991,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Good twist.
252116,L488990,u7492,m506,GALE,Nobody said she was an actor.
252117,L488928,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Bitch.
252118,L488927,u7492,m506,GALE,Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
252119,L488926,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
252120,L488925,u7492,m506,GALE,"Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic."
252121,L488924,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Basements creep me out.
252122,L488923,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Gale Weathers would find a way.
252123,L488922,u7492,m506,GALE,Possibly.
252124,L488921,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,There a story in that building?
252125,L488920,u7492,m506,GALE,No really?
252126,L488919,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Need to get in that building?
252127,L488918,u7492,m506,GALE,Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
252128,L488917,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,That's funny.
252129,L488916,u7492,m506,GALE,And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
252130,L488915,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,"You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter."
252131,L488914,u7492,m506,GALE,None.
252132,L488913,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,"Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?"
252133,L488912,u7492,m506,GALE,I am Gale Weathers!
252134,L488911,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
252135,L488910,u7492,m506,GALE,What the hell are you doing?
252136,L488909,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Geez.
252137,L488821,u7492,m506,GALE,No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
252138,L488820,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
252139,L488818,u7492,m506,GALE,I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
252140,L488817,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
252141,L488816,u7492,m506,GALE,"Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?"
252142,L488811,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Oh shit it's my cell!
252143,L488810,u7492,m506,GALE,Who's phone?
252144,L488798,u7492,m506,GALE,"I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen."
252145,L488797,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
252146,L488788,u7492,m506,GALE,"Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business."
252147,L488787,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
252148,L488786,u7492,m506,GALE,AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
252149,L488785,u7492,m506,GALE,"Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?"
252150,L488784,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,"God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!"
252151,L488783,u7492,m506,GALE,"Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?"
252152,L488782,u7493,m506,JENNIFER,You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
252153,L489009,u7494,m506,MILTON,"I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home."
252154,L489008,u7492,m506,GALE,Are you saying she was-
252155,L489007,u7494,m506,MILTON,"It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards."
252156,L489006,u7492,m506,GALE,Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
252157,L489005,u7494,m506,MILTON,"Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago."
252158,L489004,u7492,m506,GALE,I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
252159,L489003,u7494,m506,MILTON,Yeah.
252160,L489002,u7492,m506,GALE,Just because you knew her?
252161,L489001,u7494,m506,MILTON,"Get real, that would make me a suspect!"
252162,L489000,u7492,m506,GALE,"And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?"
252163,L488987,u7494,m506,MILTON,Who?
252164,L488986,u7492,m506,GALE,Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
252165,L488631,u7492,m506,GALE,They're the ones who approved it.
252166,L488630,u7494,m506,MILTON,"Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions."
252167,L488629,u7492,m506,GALE,Oh come on! Why the hostility?
252168,L488628,u7494,m506,MILTON,"Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then."
252169,L488625,u7494,m506,MILTON,"GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here."
252170,L488624,u7492,m506,GALE,"Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to."
252171,L488781,u7498,m506,TOM,You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
252172,L488780,u7492,m506,GALE,I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
252173,L488779,u7498,m506,TOM,"Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?"
252174,L488778,u7492,m506,GALE,"Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings."
252175,L488777,u7498,m506,TOM,"Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket."
252176,L488776,u7492,m506,GALE,"Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker."
252177,L488775,u7498,m506,TOM,Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
252178,L489126,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,GALE WATCHOUT!
252179,L489125,u7492,m506,GALE,Let's get out of here!
252180,L489124,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,I know!
252181,L489123,u7492,m506,GALE,I know! He killed Kincaid!
252182,L489122,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Gale he's got Dewey!
252183,L488969,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,What are you talking about?
252184,L488968,u7492,m506,GALE,"We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth."
252185,L488891,u7492,m506,GALE,Who's this.
252186,L488890,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
252187,L488873,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Oh, you know, the usual small talk, ""What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"""
252188,L488872,u7492,m506,GALE,What'd he say?
252189,L488866,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right."
252190,L488865,u7492,m506,GALE,"Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey."
252191,L489156,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
252192,L489155,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!"
252193,L489152,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye."
252194,L489151,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body."
252195,L489150,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!"
252196,L489147,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?"
252197,L489146,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro."
252198,L489145,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!"
252199,L489144,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie."
252200,L488702,u7495,m506,ROMAN,My movie.
252201,L488701,u7496,m506,SARAH,What?  What movie?
252202,L488700,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"It's not just a new script, it's a new movie."
252203,L488699,u7496,m506,SARAH,Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
252204,L488698,u7495,m506,ROMAN,It is in my script.
252205,L488697,u7496,m506,SARAH,Roman that's not the line.
252206,L488696,u7495,m506,ROMAN,It's Sarah.
252207,L488695,u7496,m506,SARAH,I'm hanging up right now.
252208,L488694,u7495,m506,ROMAN,But you know my favorite name?
252209,L488693,u7496,m506,SARAH,"Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number."
252210,L488692,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?"
252211,L488691,u7496,m506,SARAH,"This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?"
252212,L488690,u7495,m506,ROMAN,Who's this?
252213,L488689,u7496,m506,SARAH,Who's this?
252214,L488688,u7495,m506,ROMAN,Hello.
252215,L488687,u7496,m506,SARAH,Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
252216,L488686,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Page 22, Candy's big moment."
252217,L488685,u7496,m506,SARAH,"Huh, fine."
252218,L488684,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines."
252219,L488683,u7496,m506,SARAH,I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
252220,L488682,u7495,m506,ROMAN,You're not happy with your part.
252221,L488681,u7496,m506,SARAH,"What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!"
252222,L488680,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character."
252223,L488679,u7496,m506,SARAH,"Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards."
252224,L488678,u7495,m506,ROMAN,"Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away."
252225,L488677,u7496,m506,SARAH,Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
252226,L488674,u7496,m506,SARAH,Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
252227,L488673,u7499,m506,TYSON,No.
252228,L488672,u7496,m506,SARAH,"Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?"
252229,L488671,u7499,m506,TYSON,Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
252230,L488593,u7499,m506,TYSON,"I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?"
252231,L488592,u7496,m506,SARAH,Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
252232,L488591,u7499,m506,TYSON,"SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. ""What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident""."
252233,L488590,u7496,m506,SARAH,What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
252234,L488585,u7499,m506,TYSON,And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
252235,L488584,u7496,m506,SARAH,"Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting."
252236,L489109,u7500,m506,VOICE,It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
252237,L489108,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this."
252238,L489107,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,I thought you wanted me here?
252239,L489106,u7500,m506,VOICE,You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
252240,L489105,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Alright, I'm here. Now what?"
252241,L489104,u7500,m506,VOICE,You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
252242,L489103,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Yeah?
252243,L489101,u7500,m506,VOICE,"I'll call you, when you're on your way."
252244,L489100,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,WHERE?
252245,L489099,u7500,m506,VOICE,"She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together."
252246,L489098,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Where?
252247,L489093,u7500,m506,VOICE,"I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!"
252248,L489092,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,You're dead!
252249,L489088,u7500,m506,VOICE,"Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know."
252250,L489087,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,How do I know their voices are --
252251,L489086,u7500,m506,VOICE,"Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you."
252252,L489085,u7500,m506,VOICE,Go there.
252253,L489084,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Yes.
252254,L489083,u7500,m506,VOICE,"Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?"
252255,L489081,u7500,m506,VOICE,"The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me."
252256,L489080,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Who is this?
252257,L489079,u7500,m506,VOICE,"{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney."
252258,L488663,u7500,m506,VOICE,Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
252259,L488662,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
252260,L488661,u7500,m506,VOICE,No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
252261,L488660,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,The final act? Well let's play asshole!
252262,L488659,u7500,m506,VOICE,Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
252263,L488658,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
252264,L488657,u7500,m506,VOICE,"Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott."
252265,L488656,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
252266,L488655,u7500,m506,VOICE,I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
252267,L488654,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,W-what do you want?
252268,L488653,u7500,m506,VOICE,Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
252269,L488651,u7501,m506,WOMAN,"It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!"
252270,L488650,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Who the fuck is this?
252271,L488649,u7501,m506,WOMAN,"Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?"
252272,L488648,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"I'm sorry, your voice."
252273,L488647,u7501,m506,WOMAN,No I need to call you. Just you.
252274,L488646,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Well then the people you need to call are the police.
252275,L488645,u7501,m506,WOMAN,Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
252276,L488644,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,Are you sure?
252277,L488643,u7501,m506,WOMAN,Laura I think I just killed somebody.
252278,L488642,u7497,m506,SIDNEY,"Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you."
252279,L488641,u7501,m506,WOMAN,Hello?
252280,L487514,u7516,m507,STU,"I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep."
252281,L487513,u7502,m507,BILLY,FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
252282,L487507,u7502,m507,BILLY,Where the fuck did she go?
252283,L487506,u7516,m507,STU,I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
252284,L487503,u7516,m507,STU,Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
252285,L487502,u7502,m507,BILLY,She can't get both of us.
252286,L487499,u7516,m507,STU,She looked dead. Still does.
252287,L487498,u7502,m507,BILLY,I thought she was dead.
252288,L487495,u7516,m507,STU,"No, it's not."
252289,L487494,u7502,m507,BILLY,It's on the table.
252290,L487492,u7502,m507,BILLY,Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
252291,L487491,u7516,m507,STU,"That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy."
252292,L487488,u7516,m507,STU,"Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel."
252293,L487487,u7502,m507,BILLY,And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
252294,L487486,u7516,m507,STU,Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
252295,L487485,u7502,m507,BILLY,"What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone..."
252296,L487477,u7516,m507,STU,Yeah...
252297,L487476,u7502,m507,BILLY,Ready?
252298,L487475,u7502,m507,BILLY,"You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today."
252299,L487474,u7516,m507,STU,"This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?"
252300,L487472,u7516,m507,STU,That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
252301,L487471,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath."
252302,L487465,u7502,m507,BILLY,"And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid."
252303,L487464,u7516,m507,STU,Nope.
252304,L487461,u7516,m507,STU,"Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun."
252305,L487460,u7502,m507,BILLY,Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
252306,L487456,u7516,m507,STU,And if you get it right -- you die.
252307,L487455,u7502,m507,BILLY,It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
252308,L487454,u7516,m507,STU,"You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night."
252309,L487444,u7516,m507,STU,Oh yeah.
252310,L487443,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn."
252311,L487307,u7502,m507,BILLY,I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
252312,L487306,u7516,m507,STU,Dude. What are you doing here?
252313,L487165,u7516,m507,STU,You know it.
252314,L487164,u7502,m507,BILLY,You ready to party hard tonight?
252315,L487163,u7516,m507,STU,Oh...
252316,L487162,u7502,m507,BILLY,Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
252317,L487161,u7516,m507,STU,I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
252318,L487160,u7502,m507,BILLY,Duh... that's quick.
252319,L487159,u7516,m507,STU,So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
252320,L487158,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Thanks, butt wart. You did good."
252321,L487157,u7516,m507,STU,Piece of cake. She'll be there.
252322,L487156,u7502,m507,BILLY,How'd you do?
252323,L487050,u7516,m507,STU,Sorry.
252324,L487049,u7502,m507,BILLY,You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
252325,L487048,u7516,m507,STU,Owwww...
252326,L486805,u7502,m507,BILLY,No one's saying you did.
252327,L486804,u7516,m507,STU,I didn't kill anybody.
252328,L486787,u7516,m507,STU,Sorry.
252329,L486786,u7502,m507,BILLY,"It's called tact, you fuckrag."
252330,L486785,u7516,m507,STU,What? She asked.
252331,L486920,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,"We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here."
252332,L486919,u7502,m507,BILLY,"No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff."
252333,L486918,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
252334,L486915,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
252335,L486914,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Yes, sir."
252336,L486913,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,You rode your bike out there?
252337,L486912,u7502,m507,BILLY,"I just wanted to see her, that's all."
252338,L486911,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,"Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?"
252339,L487518,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy."
252340,L487517,u7502,m507,BILLY,I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
252341,L487511,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
252342,L487510,u7502,m507,BILLY,You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
252343,L487509,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Are you alone in the house?
252344,L487508,u7502,m507,BILLY,Hello?
252345,L487483,u7502,m507,BILLY,Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
252346,L487482,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Stop it!
252347,L487481,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Jesus... fuck, that hurt."
252348,L487467,u7502,m507,BILLY,"We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something."
252349,L487466,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I don't understand...
252350,L487463,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?"
252351,L487462,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Why did you kill my mother?
252352,L487453,u7502,m507,BILLY,"We already played that game. You lost, remember?"
252353,L487452,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Fuck you.
252354,L487451,u7502,m507,BILLY,It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
252355,L487434,u7502,m507,BILLY,It's okay. Give me the gun.
252356,L487433,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,NO! Don't believe him.
252357,L487430,u7502,m507,BILLY,I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
252358,L487429,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I thought you were...
252359,L487379,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you."
252360,L487378,u7502,m507,BILLY,You don't still think it was me?
252361,L487377,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Uh-huh.
252362,L487376,u7502,m507,BILLY,Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
252363,L487375,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him."
252364,L487374,u7502,m507,BILLY,I called my dad.
252365,L487373,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
252366,L487372,u7502,m507,BILLY,What?
252367,L487371,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Who did you call?
252368,L487337,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Yeah... I think so.
252369,L487336,u7502,m507,BILLY,Are you serious?
252370,L487335,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You heard me.
252371,L487334,u7502,m507,BILLY,What?
252372,L487333,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Or even a good porno.
252373,L487332,u7502,m507,BILLY,Sshh... it's okay.
252374,L487330,u7502,m507,BILLY,Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
252375,L487329,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I wanna let go. I do...
252376,L487328,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre."
252377,L487327,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,But this is life. This isn't a movie.
252378,L487326,u7502,m507,BILLY,Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
252379,L487325,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
252380,L487324,u7502,m507,BILLY,Oh Sidney...
252381,L487323,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something..."
252382,L487322,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
252383,L487321,u7502,m507,BILLY,You lost your mom...
252384,L487320,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress."
252385,L487319,u7502,m507,BILLY,So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
252386,L487318,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,So...
252387,L487311,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,It's okay. We need to talk.
252388,L487310,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Subtlety, Stu. Look it up."
252389,L487070,u7502,m507,BILLY,"You have to move on, Sid."
252390,L487069,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere."
252391,L487068,u7502,m507,BILLY,"When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back."
252392,L487067,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
252393,L487066,u7502,m507,BILLY,It's been a year since she died.
252394,L487065,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom."
252395,L487064,u7502,m507,BILLY,Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
252396,L487063,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,No...
252397,L487062,u7502,m507,BILLY,Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
252398,L487061,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You know that's not true.
252399,L487060,u7502,m507,BILLY,Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
252400,L487059,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I'm so sorry... please understand.
252401,L487058,u7502,m507,BILLY,"See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?"
252402,L487057,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
252403,L487056,u7502,m507,BILLY,"The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid."
252404,L487055,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me."
252405,L487053,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Hey, hey, it's just me."
252406,L487052,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Jesus, SHIT!"
252407,L486865,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,He's here. He's trying to kill me...
252408,L486864,u7502,m507,BILLY,I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
252409,L486863,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Oh Billy... Please... God...
252410,L486741,u7502,m507,BILLY,What's that?
252411,L486740,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
252412,L486737,u7502,m507,BILLY,I'm going... I'm going.
252413,L486736,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You know what my dad will do to you?
252414,L486733,u7502,m507,BILLY,"No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff."
252415,L486732,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
252416,L486731,u7502,m507,BILLY,"Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid ""R"" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television."
252417,L486730,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Oh it did?
252418,L486729,u7502,m507,BILLY,"And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you."
252419,L486728,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Now that it's out of your system.
252420,L486727,u7502,m507,BILLY,It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
252421,L486726,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,What are you doing here?
252422,L486725,u7502,m507,BILLY,Close call.
252423,L486712,u7502,m507,BILLY,I'll only stay a sec.
252424,L486711,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,My dad's in the other room.
252425,L486710,u7502,m507,BILLY,You sleep in THAT?
252426,L486709,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,What are you doing here?
252427,L486708,u7502,m507,BILLY,I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
252428,L486707,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Billy? What the...
252429,L486688,u7510,m507,MAN,Your call.
252430,L486687,u7503,m507,CASEY,Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
252431,L486686,u7510,m507,MAN,There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
252432,L486685,u7503,m507,CASEY,What?
252433,L486684,u7510,m507,MAN,What door am I at?
252434,L486683,u7510,m507,MAN,Answer the question and I will.
252435,L486682,u7503,m507,CASEY,...leave me alone... please...
252436,L486680,u7510,m507,MAN,"Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out."
252437,L486679,u7503,m507,CASEY,You tricked me...
252438,L486678,u7510,m507,MAN,Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
252439,L486677,u7503,m507,CASEY,It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
252440,L486676,u7510,m507,MAN,Afraid not.
252441,L486675,u7503,m507,CASEY,No it's not. It was Jason.
252442,L486674,u7510,m507,MAN,I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
252443,L486672,u7510,m507,MAN,Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
252444,L486671,u7503,m507,CASEY,...please... no...
252445,L486670,u7510,m507,MAN,Then answer the question. Same category.
252446,L486669,u7503,m507,CASEY,Please go away! Leave us alone!
252447,L486668,u7510,m507,MAN,But you're doing so well.
252448,L486667,u7503,m507,CASEY,NOOOO....
252449,L486666,u7510,m507,MAN,Now for the real question.
252450,L486665,u7510,m507,MAN,YES!
252451,L486664,u7503,m507,CASEY,Michael... Michael Myers.
252452,L486662,u7503,m507,CASEY,I can't think.
252453,L486661,u7510,m507,MAN,What's his name?
252454,L486660,u7503,m507,CASEY,Please..stop...
252455,L486659,u7510,m507,MAN,"Come on, yes you do."
252456,L486658,u7503,m507,CASEY,I don't know...
252457,L486657,u7510,m507,MAN,"Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters."
252458,L486656,u7503,m507,CASEY,No...
252459,L486655,u7510,m507,MAN,Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
252460,L486654,u7503,m507,CASEY,Don't do this. I can't...
252461,L486653,u7510,m507,MAN,I'll even give you a warm up question.
252462,L486652,u7503,m507,CASEY,...please...
252463,L486651,u7510,m507,MAN,It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
252464,L486650,u7503,m507,CASEY,No... please.
252465,L486649,u7510,m507,MAN,Come on. It'll be fun.
252466,L486648,u7503,m507,CASEY,Please don't do this...
252467,L486646,u7510,m507,MAN,Turn off the light.
252468,L486645,u7503,m507,CASEY,What kind of game?
252469,L486644,u7510,m507,MAN,Which is it?
252470,L486643,u7503,m507,CASEY,NOOO!
252471,L486642,u7510,m507,MAN,Then he dies. Right now.
252472,L486641,u7503,m507,CASEY,No...
252473,L486640,u7510,m507,MAN,I wanna play a game.
252474,L486639,u7503,m507,CASEY,Why are you doing this?
252475,L486638,u7510,m507,MAN,That all depends on you.
252476,L486637,u7503,m507,CASEY,Please don't hurt him.
252477,L486636,u7510,m507,MAN,Guess.
252478,L486635,u7503,m507,CASEY,Where are you?
252479,L486632,u7510,m507,MAN,Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
252480,L486631,u7503,m507,CASEY,How do you know his name?
252481,L486630,u7510,m507,MAN,"His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?"
252482,L486629,u7503,m507,CASEY,So you better leave.
252483,L486628,u7510,m507,MAN,I believe you...
252484,L486627,u7503,m507,CASEY,I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
252485,L486626,u7510,m507,MAN,I'm getting scared.

252563,L486545,u7503,m507,CASEY,What number are you trying to reach?

252572,L487393,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
252573,L487388,u7504,m507,DEWEY,I don't think you're so bad.
252574,L487387,u7506,m507,GALE,People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
252575,L487386,u7506,m507,GALE,What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
252576,L487385,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
252577,L487384,u7506,m507,GALE,I like it. It's... sexy.
252578,L487383,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
252579,L487382,u7506,m507,GALE,So is Dewey your real name?
252580,L487360,u7504,m507,DEWEY,NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
252581,L487359,u7506,m507,GALE,Can I bring Kenny?
252582,L487358,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town."
252583,L487357,u7506,m507,GALE,I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
252584,L487356,u7504,m507,DEWEY,A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
252585,L487355,u7506,m507,GALE,What kind of lead?
252586,L487354,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
252587,L487259,u7506,m507,GALE,Mind if I join you?
252588,L487258,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
252589,L487257,u7506,m507,GALE,Then what are you doing here?
252590,L487256,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
252591,L487255,u7506,m507,GALE,You never know when or where a story will break.
252592,L487254,u7504,m507,DEWEY,What brings you out to these parts?
252593,L487253,u7506,m507,GALE,Deputy... good evening.
252594,L487252,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Evening, ma'am."
252595,L487124,u7506,m507,GALE,"You are precious. Please, call me Gale."
252596,L487123,u7504,m507,DEWEY,I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
252597,L487121,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person."
252598,L487120,u7506,m507,GALE,Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
252599,L487119,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"If you'll excuse me, ma'am."
252600,L487118,u7504,m507,DEWEY,We haven't ruled out that possibil...
252601,L487117,u7506,m507,GALE,"He's not a suspect, is he?"
252602,L487116,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"No, not yet."
252603,L487115,u7506,m507,GALE,Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
252604,L487114,u7504,m507,DEWEY,We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
252605,L487113,u7506,m507,GALE,"Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there."
252606,L487112,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice."
252607,L487111,u7506,m507,GALE,"Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer."
252608,L487108,u7506,m507,GALE,"Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?"
252609,L487107,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am."
252610,L487106,u7506,m507,GALE,"I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer."
252611,L487105,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"You're not supposed to be here, ma'am."
252612,L487104,u7506,m507,GALE,And why is that? Has something happened?
252613,L487103,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
252614,L487102,u7506,m507,GALE,Productive. So they're closing down the school?
252615,L487101,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?"
252616,L487100,u7506,m507,GALE,"Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY."
252617,L487274,u7504,m507,DEWEY,She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
252618,L487273,u7517,m507,TATUM,What is she doing here?
252619,L487242,u7517,m507,TATUM,Shit.
252620,L487241,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise."
252621,L487240,u7517,m507,TATUM,"No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night."
252622,L487193,u7517,m507,TATUM,Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
252623,L487192,u7504,m507,DEWEY,A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
252624,L486932,u7517,m507,TATUM,"I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go."
252625,L486931,u7504,m507,DEWEY,What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
252626,L486927,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Hold up a sec...
252627,L486926,u7517,m507,TATUM,Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
252628,L486888,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Yes, you doofus."
252629,L486887,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Does mom know?
252630,L486884,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene."
252631,L486883,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late."
252632,L486882,u7504,m507,DEWEY,What are you doing here?
252633,L487289,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Not yet.
252634,L487288,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Should I be worried?
252635,L487287,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Afraid not.
252636,L487286,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Have they found my father?
252637,L487239,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid."
252638,L487238,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Yeah.
252639,L487237,u7504,m507,DEWEY,You girls ready.
252640,L487199,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling."
252641,L487198,u7504,m507,DEWEY,I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
252642,L487195,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas."
252643,L487194,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN."
252644,L486985,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,And my Dad? Any word on him?
252645,L486984,u7504,m507,DEWEY,I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
252646,L486983,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up."
252647,L486982,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
252648,L486949,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything..."
252649,L486948,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Any word on my Dad?
252650,L486905,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry."
252651,L486904,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I don't know. I guess.
252652,L486903,u7504,m507,DEWEY,He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
252653,L486902,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,At the airport.
252654,L486901,u7504,m507,DEWEY,You're sure it was the Hilton?
252655,L486900,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Did you reach my Dad?
252656,L486880,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,...yeah...
252657,L486879,u7504,m507,DEWEY,You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
252658,L487218,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Yes, sir."
252659,L487217,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
252660,L487216,u7504,m507,DEWEY,She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
252661,L487215,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
252662,L487214,u7504,m507,DEWEY,She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
252663,L487213,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
252664,L487212,u7504,m507,DEWEY,You think he could still be in town?
252665,L487211,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
252666,L487210,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Have you contacted the bureau?
252667,L487209,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
252668,L487208,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
252669,L487207,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,"Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed."
252670,L487206,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Keeping my eye on Sidney.
252671,L487205,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,"Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?"
252672,L487099,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"Yes, sir, sheriff."
252673,L487098,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
252674,L486929,u7504,m507,DEWEY,We haven't located her Dad yet.
252675,L486928,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,She staying with you?
252676,L486925,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
252677,L486924,u7504,m507,DEWEY,They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
252678,L486923,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,What about the cellular phone bill?
252679,L486922,u7504,m507,DEWEY,That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
252680,L486877,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
252681,L486876,u7504,m507,DEWEY,She's tough.
252682,L486875,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,How is she?
252683,L486874,u7504,m507,DEWEY,Drive by patrol.
252684,L486873,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,What were you doing out here?
252685,L486872,u7504,m507,DEWEY,I was first to respond.
252686,L486870,u7504,m507,DEWEY,He's her boyfriend.
252687,L486869,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
252688,L486868,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis."
252689,L486768,u7514,m507,SHERIFF BURKE,How is everything?
252690,L486767,u7504,m507,DEWEY,"It's Deputy Riley today, Sid."
252691,L486704,u7511,m507,MOTHER,Not my daughter... not my...
252692,L486703,u7505,m507,FATHER,Casey! Casey!
252693,L486702,u7511,m507,MOTHER,"I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her."
252694,L486701,u7505,m507,FATHER,Where is she?
252695,L486698,u7511,m507,MOTHER,The phone's dead.
252696,L486697,u7505,m507,FATHER,"Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit."
252697,L486696,u7505,m507,FATHER,Call the police.
252698,L486695,u7511,m507,MOTHER,Where is she?
252699,L486694,u7505,m507,FATHER,Casey? Casey?
252700,L486693,u7511,m507,MOTHER,What is it? Where's Casey?
252701,L486692,u7505,m507,FATHER,Jesus...
252702,L486691,u7511,m507,MOTHER,I told you to send it back.
252703,L486690,u7505,m507,FATHER,That fish smelled strong.
252704,L487251,u7506,m507,GALE,As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
252705,L487250,u7509,m507,KENNY,About thirty seconds.
252706,L487249,u7506,m507,GALE,What's the delay?
252707,L487248,u7509,m507,KENNY,The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
252708,L487247,u7506,m507,GALE,"Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities."
252709,L487246,u7509,m507,KENNY,What's the plan?
252710,L487030,u7506,m507,GALE,"Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty."
252711,L487029,u7509,m507,KENNY,But it's so much easier when we make it up.
252712,L487028,u7506,m507,GALE,If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
252713,L487027,u7509,m507,KENNY,When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
252714,L487026,u7506,m507,GALE,"No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete."
252715,L487025,u7509,m507,KENNY,You want to go live?
252716,L487024,u7506,m507,GALE,"Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming."
252717,L486892,u7506,m507,GALE,Jesus! The camera-hurry!
252718,L486891,u7509,m507,KENNY,What? What?
252719,L487015,u7506,m507,GALE,"But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?"
252720,L487014,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I saw him leaving wearing it.
252721,L487013,u7506,m507,GALE,"He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him..."
252722,L487012,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat."
252723,L487011,u7506,m507,GALE,Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
252724,L487010,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Has his story changed?
252725,L487009,u7506,m507,GALE,Many times.
252726,L487008,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Have you talked to Cotton?
252727,L487007,u7506,m507,GALE,I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
252728,L487006,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar."
252729,L487005,u7506,m507,GALE,He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
252730,L487004,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Do you still think he's innocent?
252731,L487003,u7506,m507,GALE,What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
252732,L487002,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
252733,L487001,u7506,m507,GALE,Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
252734,L487000,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You owe my mother.
252735,L486999,u7506,m507,GALE,I owe you shit.
252736,L486998,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Please. You owe me.
252737,L486997,u7506,m507,GALE,Forget it.
252738,L486996,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Off the record. No cameras.
252739,L486995,u7506,m507,GALE,Kenny. Camera. Now.
252740,L486994,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I want to talk to you.
252741,L486993,u7506,m507,GALE,Just stay back.
252742,L486992,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I'm not here to fight.
252743,L486944,u7506,m507,GALE,I'll send you a copy.
252744,L486943,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I'll look for it.
252745,L486942,u7506,m507,GALE,It'll be out later this year.
252746,L486941,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,How's the book?
252747,L486940,u7506,m507,GALE,"Yes, that's right."
252748,L486939,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?"
252749,L487085,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,Ricki Lake.
252750,L487084,u7508,m507,GIRL #2,Where do you get this shit?
252751,L487083,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,"And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression."
252752,L487082,u7508,m507,GIRL #2,Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
252753,L487081,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,"Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop."
252754,L487080,u7508,m507,GIRL #2,You're evil.
252755,L487079,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
252756,L487078,u7508,m507,GIRL #2,Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
252757,L487077,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
252758,L487076,u7508,m507,GIRL #2,And why would she do that?
252759,L487075,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
252760,L487074,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
252761,L487073,u7508,m507,GIRL #2,Why would she lie about it?
252762,L487072,u7507,m507,GIRL #1,She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
252763,L486970,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Who are you?
252764,L486969,u7510,m507,MAN,Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
252765,L486968,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,LEAVEMEALONE!
252766,L486967,u7510,m507,MAN,Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
252767,L486965,u7510,m507,MAN,Hello Sidney.
252768,L486964,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Hello?
252769,L486858,u7510,m507,MAN,"If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother."
252770,L486857,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now."
252771,L486856,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,What am I doing?
252772,L486855,u7510,m507,MAN,Uh-huh.
252773,L486854,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Can you see me right now?
252774,L486853,u7510,m507,MAN,Right here.
252775,L486852,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,So where are you?
252776,L486850,u7510,m507,MAN,That's the original part.
252777,L486849,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Why would you call me from my front porch?
252778,L486848,u7510,m507,MAN,Your front porch.
252779,L486847,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,So where are you?
252780,L486846,u7510,m507,MAN,The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
252781,L486845,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,So who are you?
252782,L486844,u7510,m507,MAN,Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
252783,L486843,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy."
252784,L486842,u7510,m507,MAN,Are you alone in the house?
252785,L486841,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
252786,L486840,u7510,m507,MAN,And why is that?
252787,L486839,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
252788,L486838,u7510,m507,MAN,What's your favorite scary movie?
252789,L486837,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy."
252790,L486836,u7510,m507,MAN,"Do you like scary movies, Sidney?"
252791,L486835,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over."
252792,L486834,u7510,m507,MAN,"Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something."
252793,L486833,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I have no idea.
252794,L486724,u7512,m507,MR. PRESCOTT,"Sleep tight, sweetie."
252795,L486723,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Have a good trip.
252796,L486721,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Got it.
252797,L486720,u7512,m507,MR. PRESCOTT,...so call if you need me.
252798,L486719,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,...out at the airport...
252799,L486718,u7512,m507,MR. PRESCOTT,"No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton..."
252800,L486717,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,No you didn't.
252801,L486716,u7512,m507,MR. PRESCOTT,I heard screaming.
252802,L486715,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Can you knock?
252803,L486714,u7512,m507,MR. PRESCOTT,Are you okay?
252804,L486803,u7513,m507,RANDY,Twice.
252805,L486802,u7517,m507,TATUM,I thought Blockbuster fired you.
252806,L486801,u7513,m507,RANDY,"Working, thank you."
252807,L486800,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?"
252808,L486799,u7513,m507,RANDY,Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
252809,L486798,u7517,m507,TATUM,Stu was with me last night.
252810,L487530,u7513,m507,RANDY,You got it.
252811,L487529,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
252812,L487414,u7513,m507,RANDY,"Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it."
252813,L487413,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Don't come any closer.
252814,L487412,u7513,m507,RANDY,Don't shoot. It's me.
252815,L487411,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Stop. Right there.
252816,L487265,u7513,m507,RANDY,She's the Scream Queen.
252817,L487264,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?"
252818,L487421,u7513,m507,RANDY,"No, Sid."
252819,L487420,u7516,m507,STU,"Come on, Sid. Give me the gun."
252820,L487419,u7513,m507,RANDY,Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
252821,L487418,u7516,m507,STU,"His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho."
252822,L487352,u7516,m507,STU,I'll be right back.
252823,L487351,u7513,m507,RANDY,Yeah.
252824,L487350,u7516,m507,STU,Wanna another beer?
252825,L487349,u7513,m507,RANDY,"There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say ""I'll be right back."""
252826,L487345,u7513,m507,RANDY,Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
252827,L487344,u7516,m507,STU,I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
252828,L487315,u7516,m507,STU,Like you had one.
252829,L487314,u7513,m507,RANDY,There goes my chance with Sid.
252830,L487313,u7516,m507,STU,He came to make up.
252831,L487312,u7513,m507,RANDY,What's Leatherface doing here?
252832,L487281,u7516,m507,STU,I can cry on cue.
252833,L487280,u7513,m507,RANDY,We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
252834,L487263,u7513,m507,RANDY,I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
252835,L487262,u7516,m507,STU,I thought everything was checked out.
252836,L487191,u7513,m507,RANDY,It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
252837,L487190,u7516,m507,STU,And what would be your motive?
252838,L487189,u7513,m507,RANDY,"You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect."
252839,L487185,u7513,m507,RANDY,"So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition."
252840,L487184,u7516,m507,STU,Which is you...
252841,L487183,u7513,m507,RANDY,"Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict..."
252842,L487182,u7516,m507,STU,I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
252843,L487181,u7513,m507,RANDY,"Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?"
252844,L487180,u7516,m507,STU,She's saving herself for you.
252845,L487179,u7513,m507,RANDY,Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
252846,L487178,u7516,m507,STU,So what's his reason?
252847,L487177,u7513,m507,RANDY,"There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience."
252848,L487176,u7516,m507,STU,Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
252849,L487175,u7513,m507,RANDY,"Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited."
252850,L487174,u7516,m507,STU,The why'd the police let him go?
252851,L487173,u7513,m507,RANDY,You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
252852,L487172,u7516,m507,STU,It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
252853,L487171,u7513,m507,RANDY,If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
252854,L487170,u7516,m507,STU,What?
252855,L487169,u7513,m507,RANDY,"Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste."
252856,L487168,u7516,m507,STU,You coming tonight?
252857,L487167,u7513,m507,RANDY,We had a run in the mass murder section.
252858,L487166,u7516,m507,STU,"Jesus, this place is packed."
252859,L486808,u7513,m507,RANDY,Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
252860,L486807,u7516,m507,STU,I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
252861,L486806,u7513,m507,RANDY,"Besides --  ""Takes a man to do something like that."""
252862,L486797,u7513,m507,RANDY,It would certainly improve your high school Q.
252863,L486796,u7516,m507,STU,What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
252864,L486795,u7513,m507,RANDY,And are the police aware you dated the victim?
252865,L486792,u7513,m507,RANDY,Before she dumped him for Steve.
252866,L486791,u7516,m507,STU,For about two seconds.
252867,L486781,u7516,m507,STU,"Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that."
252868,L486780,u7513,m507,RANDY,That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
252869,L487516,u7516,m507,STU,Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
252870,L487515,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?"
252871,L487459,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You'll never get away with this.
252872,L487458,u7516,m507,STU,"The official term is ""psychotic""."
252873,L487457,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You're crazy -- both of you.
252874,L487450,u7516,m507,STU,It's all part of the game.
252875,L487449,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Why are you doing this?
252876,L487448,u7516,m507,STU,"Guess, I won't be needing this anymore."
252877,L487309,u7516,m507,STU,You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
252878,L487308,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
252879,L487139,u7516,m507,STU,Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
252880,L487138,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Yeah, okay... whatever."
252881,L487137,u7516,m507,STU,"Remember, there's safety in numbers."
252882,L487133,u7516,m507,STU,"My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'."
252883,L487132,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Are you serious?
252884,L487131,u7516,m507,STU,"And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house."
252885,L487047,u7516,m507,STU,Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
252886,L487046,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Why are they doing this?
252887,L486790,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?"
252888,L486789,u7516,m507,STU,You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
252889,L487236,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Deal.
252890,L487235,u7517,m507,TATUM,"There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight."
252891,L487234,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out."
252892,L487233,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,TATUM!
252893,L487232,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing."
252894,L487231,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
252895,L487230,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, ""Eight is enough..."""
252896,L487229,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,No way.
252897,L487228,u7517,m507,TATUM,"During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" It's a real turn on."
252898,L487227,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
252899,L487226,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman."
252900,L487225,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Who?
252901,L487224,u7517,m507,TATUM,"With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve."
252902,L487223,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,What do you think about when you're having sex?
252903,L487222,u7517,m507,TATUM,Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
252904,L487221,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?"
252905,L487220,u7517,m507,TATUM,You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
252906,L487219,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax."
252907,L487202,u7517,m507,TATUM,He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
252908,L487201,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Is Billy going to be there tonight?
252909,L487197,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Oh, god..."
252910,L487196,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?"
252911,L487155,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Come on, let's rock."
252912,L487154,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
252913,L487153,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us."
252914,L487152,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there."
252915,L487151,u7517,m507,TATUM,Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
252916,L487150,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,And you believe it?
252917,L487149,u7517,m507,TATUM,"It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men."
252918,L487148,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
252919,L487147,u7517,m507,TATUM,You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
252920,L487146,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
252921,L487145,u7517,m507,TATUM,"I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman."
252922,L487144,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,So you think my mom was a slut too?
252923,L487143,u7517,m507,TATUM,Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
252924,L487136,u7517,m507,TATUM,Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
252925,L487135,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I don't know...
252926,L487134,u7517,m507,TATUM,"This could be good. What do you think, Sid?"
252927,L487126,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"It was him, Tatum. I know it."
252928,L487125,u7517,m507,TATUM,It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
252929,L487041,u7517,m507,TATUM,Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
252930,L487040,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I bet he's pissed.
252931,L487039,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Shit, what is he doing here?"
252932,L487038,u7517,m507,TATUM,"I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?"
252933,L487037,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
252934,L487032,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
252935,L487031,u7517,m507,TATUM,Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
252936,L486990,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
252937,L486989,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Come on, Sid."
252938,L486962,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,It's alright. I'll get it.
252939,L486961,u7517,m507,TATUM,Take a message.
252940,L486956,u7517,m507,TATUM,I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
252941,L486955,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"He was there, Tatum."
252942,L486954,u7517,m507,TATUM,Do you really think Billy did it?
252943,L486953,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"No, nothing's like it used to be."
252944,L486952,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Just like old times, ain't it?"
252945,L486951,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
252946,L486886,u7517,m507,TATUM,Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
252947,L486885,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
252948,L486828,u7517,m507,TATUM,Bye.
252949,L486827,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Whatever. Just hurry.
252950,L486826,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis."
252951,L486825,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,I'm not worried.
252952,L486824,u7517,m507,TATUM,Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
252953,L486823,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,It's past seven.
252954,L486822,u7517,m507,TATUM,Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
252955,L486818,u7517,m507,TATUM,Later.
252956,L486817,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Thanks, Tatum."
252957,L486816,u7517,m507,TATUM,I'll be there by seven. I promise
252958,L486815,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,"Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back."
252959,L486814,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Yeah, yeah... are you okay?"
252960,L486813,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Tell your mom I said thanks.
252961,L486812,u7517,m507,TATUM,No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
252962,L486811,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
252963,L486783,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,How do you gut someone?
252964,L486782,u7517,m507,TATUM,Or a man's mentality.
252965,L486756,u7517,m507,TATUM,They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
252966,L486755,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,They think it's school-related?
252967,L486754,u7517,m507,TATUM,"Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors..."
252968,L486753,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Do they know who did it?
252969,L486752,u7517,m507,TATUM,Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
252970,L486751,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
252971,L486750,u7517,m507,TATUM,"And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end."
252972,L486749,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,No way.
252973,L486748,u7517,m507,TATUM,Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
252974,L486747,u7515,m507,SIDNEY,What happened?
252975,L486746,u7517,m507,TATUM,Do you believe this shit?
252976,L487271,u7516,m507,STU,"Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?"
252977,L487270,u7517,m507,TATUM,What am I? The beer wench?
252978,L487269,u7516,m507,STU,I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
252979,L487267,u7517,m507,TATUM,Tits -- see.
252980,L487266,u7516,m507,STU,With that set of lungs -- she should be.
252981,L487245,u7516,m507,STU,Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
252982,L487244,u7517,m507,TATUM,That's mature.
252983,L487130,u7516,m507,STU,"Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you."
252984,L487129,u7517,m507,TATUM,"For once, Stu, drop it."
252985,L487128,u7516,m507,STU,"Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?"
252986,L487044,u7516,m507,STU,"Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it."
252987,L487043,u7517,m507,TATUM,"You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school."
252988,L486794,u7516,m507,STU,I did. He's full of shit.
252989,L486793,u7517,m507,TATUM,I thought you dumped her for me.
252990,L486779,u7517,m507,TATUM,That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
252991,L486778,u7516,m507,STU,Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
252992,L486774,u7516,m507,STU,"I don't know, they just did."
252993,L486773,u7517,m507,TATUM,Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
252994,L489945,u7522,m508,MILLS,I'm in.
252995,L489944,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,What do you think?
252996,L489936,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,"Ease back, Mills."
252997,L489935,u7522,m508,MILLS,How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
252998,L489920,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,"You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go."
252999,L489919,u7522,m508,MILLS,He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
253000,L489916,u7522,m508,MILLS,He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
253001,L489915,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,You don't.  It goes to court now.
253002,L489912,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,"So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way."
253003,L489911,u7522,m508,MILLS,What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
253004,L489910,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
253005,L489333,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
253006,L489332,u7522,m508,MILLS,Thank you.
253007,L489331,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,That's not necessary.  You're in.
253008,L489328,u7522,m508,MILLS,"There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, ""goodbye.""  Give it to me."
253009,L489327,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,How's that?
253010,L489326,u7522,m508,MILLS,Give it to me.
253011,L489325,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,"I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you."
253012,L490105,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I'll see you.
253013,L490104,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
253014,L490103,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I read about it in the paper.
253015,L490102,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,He's being arraigned tomorrow.
253016,L490099,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,It would be too hard.
253017,L490098,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,"They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it."
253018,L490097,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Yeah, that's true."
253019,L490096,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
253020,L490095,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Thank you.  Tell them, thank you."
253021,L490093,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great."
253022,L490092,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,How you feeling?
253023,L489918,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,He's not finished.
253024,L489917,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,"Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense."
253025,L489357,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Really?
253026,L489356,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,It's always been like this.
253027,L489355,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I have no understanding of this place anymore.
253028,L489354,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,I heard.
253029,L489353,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here."

253031,L489351,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,What are you talking about?
253032,L489350,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
253033,L489349,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house."

253040,L489342,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,Greed.  It was written in blood.

253050,L489313,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,One is gluttony.
253051,L489312,u7518,m508,CAPTAIN,"Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do."

253065,L490044,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Put it down.  Put it on the ground.

253102,L490004,u7521,m508,JOHN DOE,Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
253103,L490003,u7521,m508,JOHN DOE,"Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?"

A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on."

An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets."
253114,L489992,u7522,m508,MILLS,You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.

253373,L489451,u7522,m508,MILLS,"Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday."
253374,L489450,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually."

253392,L489390,u7522,m508,MILLS,Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
253393,L489389,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
253394,L489330,u7522,m508,MILLS,Can we talk about this in private?
253395,L489329,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,It's too soon for him.

253397,L489317,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.

253399,L489314,u7522,m508,MILLS,This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
253400,L489305,u7522,m508,MILLS,This was one sadistic motherfucker.
253401,L489304,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him."
253402,L489300,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional."
253403,L489299,u7522,m508,MILLS,It could be nothing.

253406,L489295,u7522,m508,MILLS,Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?

253408,L489273,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.

253410,L489271,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Is that clear?

253427,L489242,u7522,m508,MILLS,"When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards..."
253428,L489239,u7522,m508,MILLS,"Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is."

253433,L489232,u7522,m508,MILLS,And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
253434,L489231,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
253435,L489218,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it."
253436,L489217,u7522,m508,MILLS,I realize that.
253437,L489216,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Not here.
253438,L489215,u7522,m508,MILLS,I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.

253440,L489213,u7522,m508,MILLS,"Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go."
253441,L489212,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective."
253442,L489211,u7522,m508,MILLS,Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
253443,L489210,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,You just met me.
253444,L489209,u7522,m508,MILLS,"I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit."
253445,L489208,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head."
253446,L489207,u7522,m508,MILLS,I... I don't follow.
253447,L489206,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?"
253448,L489205,u7522,m508,MILLS,"I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people."
253449,L489204,u7522,m508,MILLS,"Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing."
253450,L489203,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll..."
253451,L489202,u7522,m508,MILLS,I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
253452,L489503,u7523,m508,MRS GOULD,Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
253453,L489502,u7522,m508,MILLS,What?
253454,L489501,u7523,m508,MRS GOULD,This painting...
253455,L489496,u7523,m508,MRS GOULD,I can't do this now... please.
253456,L489495,u7522,m508,MILLS,Are you absolutely certain?
253457,L489494,u7523,m508,MRS GOULD,I don't see anything.

253460,L489491,u7523,m508,MRS GOULD,I don't know why... why now?
253461,L489490,u7522,m508,MILLS,I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
253462,L489489,u7523,m508,MRS GOULD,I... I don't understand.
253463,L489488,u7522,m508,MILLS,"I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am."
253464,L489803,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently."
253465,L489802,u7526,m508,TRACY,I want to have children.  It's just...
253466,L489801,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly."
253467,L489799,u7526,m508,TRACY,I hate this city.
253468,L489798,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this."
253469,L489795,u7526,m508,TRACY,I don't know...

253472,L489792,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,He mentioned it.
253473,L489791,u7526,m508,TRACY,"I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did."
253474,L489790,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
253475,L489789,u7526,m508,TRACY,I don't know why I asked you to come.
253476,L489788,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
253477,L489787,u7526,m508,TRACY,Perfect example.
253478,L489786,u7526,m508,TRACY,"I'm sorry, I only..."
253479,L489785,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
253480,L489784,u7526,m508,TRACY,I don't sleep very well.
253481,L489783,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,It's a hard place.
253482,L489782,u7526,m508,TRACY,"I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long."
253483,L489781,u7526,m508,TRACY,"If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight."
253484,L489780,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"I don't know, with this case."
253485,L489430,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Too long.  What do you think so far?
253486,L489429,u7526,m508,TRACY,How long have you lived here?
253487,L489427,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
253488,L489426,u7526,m508,TRACY,It surprises me.  It really does.
253489,L489425,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
253490,L489422,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
253491,L489421,u7526,m508,TRACY,"You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is."
253492,L489416,u7526,m508,TRACY,"No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them."
253493,L489415,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
253494,L489413,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Really?
253495,L489412,u7526,m508,TRACY,"High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met."
253496,L489411,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
253497,L489409,u7526,m508,TRACY,"What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down."
253498,L489408,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,It smells good.
253499,L489406,u7526,m508,TRACY,"It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William."
253500,L489405,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Oh... um, William."
253501,L489404,u7526,m508,TRACY,It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.

253503,L489196,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Did their son see it happen?
253504,L489195,u7525,m508,TAYLOR,This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
253505,L489194,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
253506,L489193,u7525,m508,TAYLOR,Crime of passion.
253507,L489192,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,"Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist."
253508,L489191,u7525,m508,TAYLOR,When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
253509,L489190,u7524,m508,SOMERSET,Did the wife confess?
253510,L489189,u7525,m508,TAYLOR,"Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels."

253513,L490171,u7527,m509,AARON,"You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?"
253514,L490170,u7533,m509,ETHAN,You askin' me to clear out now?
253515,L490167,u7527,m509,AARON,"They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit."
253516,L490166,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
253517,L490134,u7533,m509,ETHAN,It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
253518,L490133,u7527,m509,AARON,It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
253519,L490121,u7533,m509,ETHAN,That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
253520,L490120,u7527,m509,AARON,But Mose Harper said...
253521,L490119,u7533,m509,ETHAN,How should I know?
253522,L490118,u7527,m509,AARON,How's California?
253523,L490272,u7528,m509,BEN,"I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?"
253524,L490271,u7541,m509,MARTHA,"What, Ben?"
253525,L490270,u7528,m509,BEN,"It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish..."
253526,L490144,u7528,m509,BEN,"It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?"
253527,L490143,u7541,m509,MARTHA,"Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back."
253528,L490127,u7541,m509,MARTHA,"That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!"
253529,L490126,u7528,m509,BEN,"An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!"
253530,L490125,u7541,m509,MARTHA,Lucy's going on seventeen now...
253531,L490434,u7533,m509,ETHAN,What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
253532,L490433,u7529,m509,BRAD,"It was, I tell you!"
253533,L490432,u7533,m509,ETHAN,What you saw wasn't Lucy.
253534,L490423,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Huh...? No...no water.
253535,L490422,u7529,m509,BRAD,Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
253536,L490413,u7533,m509,ETHAN,That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
253537,L490412,u7529,m509,BRAD,"You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!"
253538,L490408,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
253539,L490407,u7529,m509,BRAD,"They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!"
253540,L490340,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Why don't you finish the job?
253541,L490339,u7529,m509,BRAD,Let's get along...
253542,L490251,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
253543,L490250,u7529,m509,BRAD,Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
253544,L490913,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,I ain't wearing no gun.
253545,L490912,u7542,m509,MARTIN,"It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside."
253546,L490910,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
253547,L490909,u7542,m509,MARTIN,If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
253548,L490908,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
253549,L490907,u7542,m509,MARTIN,"As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage..."
253550,L490906,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
253551,L490905,u7542,m509,MARTIN,<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
253552,L490973,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,Yes sir...
253553,L490972,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word..."
253554,L490934,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious..."
253555,L490933,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
253556,L490923,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'..."
253557,L490922,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,Dunno...Seems so.
253558,L490921,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"You all right, sergeant?"
253559,L490917,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"In that case, give the boys room..."
253560,L490916,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,No sir...pleasure.
253561,L490915,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?"
253562,L490332,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan."
253563,L490331,u7530,m509,CHARLIE,This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
253564,L490330,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Another one, eh?"
253565,L491005,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do..."
253566,L491004,u7533,m509,ETHAN,I say NO!
253567,L491000,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Now mount up, son..."
253568,L490999,u7533,m509,ETHAN,I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
253569,L490996,u7533,m509,ETHAN,There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
253570,L490995,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here."
253571,L490989,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
253572,L490988,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"How many, would you say?"
253573,L490987,u7533,m509,ETHAN,We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
253574,L490930,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise."
253575,L490929,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?"
253576,L490928,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan."
253577,L490919,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone..."
253578,L490918,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Fight fair, son...Use your fists!"
253579,L490889,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do..."
253580,L490888,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
253581,L490386,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,You got one now!
253582,L490385,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch..."
253583,L490384,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,I didn't give any order to fire!
253584,L490371,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"How far's the river from here, Mose?"
253585,L490370,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded."
253586,L490365,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,Just keep goin'...
253587,L490364,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"You got any more orders, Captain?"
253588,L490359,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!"
253589,L490358,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!"
253590,L490357,u7533,m509,ETHAN,What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
253591,L490352,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!"
253592,L490351,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"It's what we're here for, ain't it?"
253593,L490350,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?"
253594,L490349,u7533,m509,ETHAN,They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
253595,L490342,u7533,m509,ETHAN,By what you preach...none!
253596,L490341,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,What good does that do?
253597,L490318,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
253598,L490317,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
253599,L490316,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,He cometh forth like a...
253600,L490224,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend..."
253601,L490223,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,You fit a lot of descriptions.
253602,L490222,u7533,m509,ETHAN,Got a warrant?
253603,L490221,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
253604,L490220,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?"
253605,L490219,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?"
253606,L490218,u7533,m509,ETHAN,You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
253607,L490213,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you."
253608,L490212,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
253609,L490211,u7533,m509,ETHAN,You ain't goin'...
253610,L490207,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!"
253611,L490206,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender."
253612,L491019,u7536,m509,GREENHILL,"Yes, sir..."
253613,L491018,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand..."
253614,L491017,u7536,m509,GREENHILL,"But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?"
253615,L491016,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at..."
253616,L491015,u7536,m509,GREENHILL,"If there's anything I can do, sir..."
253617,L491014,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work."
253618,L491013,u7536,m509,GREENHILL,"Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you..."
253619,L491012,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
253620,L491011,u7536,m509,GREENHILL,Sir?
253621,L491010,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
253622,L491009,u7536,m509,GREENHILL,Captain Clayton...Captain!
253623,L491008,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,What in...?
253624,L490971,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!"
253625,L490970,u7540,m509,LIEUTENANT,"But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection..."
253626,L490969,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good..."
253627,L490951,u7540,m509,LIEUTENANT,"Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair."
253628,L490950,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,And what makes you think he's in this territory?
253629,L490947,u7540,m509,LIEUTENANT,Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
253630,L490946,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,JOINT action?
253631,L490945,u7540,m509,LIEUTENANT,"My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches."
253632,L490944,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
253633,L490943,u7540,m509,LIEUTENANT,"Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir."
253634,L490942,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,"Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?"
253635,L490941,u7540,m509,LIEUTENANT,"Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and..."
253636,L490939,u7531,m509,CLAYTON,I'm Clayton.
253637,L490938,u7540,m509,LIEUTENANT,"Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?"

253654,L490956,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?"

253659,L490761,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair..."
253660,L490760,u7543,m509,MOSE,"Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire..."
253661,L490759,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"Well, the reward still stands..."
253662,L490752,u7533,m509,ETHAN,You were born old...

253666,L490381,u7533,m509,ETHAN,"Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours..."

253671,L490538,u7534,m509,FUTTERMAN,In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
253672,L490537,u7533,m509,ETHAN,And maybe you lie...

253885,L496212,u7546,m510,ELLEN,I wouldn't have made it by myself.
253886,L496211,u7548,m510,MARTIN,How did you get me out of there?
253887,L496209,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?"
253888,L496208,u7546,m510,ELLEN,What?
253889,L496183,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son."
253890,L496182,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be."
253891,L496180,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
253892,L496179,u7548,m510,MARTIN,It's important - he knows the last chapter.
253893,L496177,u7546,m510,ELLEN,'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
253894,L496176,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go."
253895,L496131,u7546,m510,ELLEN,We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
253896,L496130,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew."
253897,L496104,u7546,m510,ELLEN,What are you talking about-
253898,L496103,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?"
253899,L496102,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!"
253900,L496101,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this."
253901,L496100,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way."
253902,L496099,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Martin, what-"
253903,L496085,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!"
253904,L496084,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?"
253905,L496082,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  ""There is something negative about the place...""  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!"
253906,L496081,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place."
253907,L496080,u7548,m510,MARTIN,During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
253908,L496073,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Hi, darling."
253909,L496072,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
253910,L496010,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?"
253911,L496009,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Maybe an animal.
253912,L496008,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
253913,L496007,u7548,m510,MARTIN,She was old.
253914,L496006,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
253915,L496005,u7548,m510,MARTIN,What?
253916,L495956,u7546,m510,ELLEN,I haven't the slightest idea.
253917,L495955,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Who's that?
253918,L495953,u7546,m510,ELLEN,The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
253919,L495952,u7548,m510,MARTIN,What? What am I supposed to sense?
253920,L495951,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?"
253921,L495950,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!"
253922,L495949,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"""Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."""
253923,L495947,u7546,m510,ELLEN,In the village.  Look what I found.
253924,L495946,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Where have you been?
253925,L495920,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!"
253926,L495919,u7546,m510,ELLEN,But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
253927,L495915,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!"
253928,L495914,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Where have you been all day?
253929,L495913,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara."
253930,L495912,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
253931,L495888,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?"
253932,L495887,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us."
253933,L495885,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Yeah... I have to go to town.
253934,L495884,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"So, did you sleep good?"
253935,L495868,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these."
253936,L495867,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Now, what did I do to deserve this?"
253937,L495864,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep."
253938,L495863,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!"
253939,L495862,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis."
253940,L495861,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Martin, it's not funny!"
253941,L495858,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Someone from the village.
253942,L495857,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Who was that?
253943,L495840,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together."
253944,L495839,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen."
253945,L495838,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
253946,L495837,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"So do I, believe me."
253947,L495836,u7546,m510,ELLEN,I miss Tommi so much.
253948,L495834,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  ""With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."""
253949,L495833,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you."
253950,L495832,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
253951,L495831,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair."
253952,L495830,u7548,m510,MARTIN,What?
253953,L495829,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Cherry-red Tears.
253954,L495828,u7548,m510,MARTIN,We just have to make a new beginning.
253955,L495827,u7546,m510,ELLEN,I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
253956,L495826,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can."
253957,L495825,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
253958,L495822,u7546,m510,ELLEN,I just had a really strange experience.
253959,L495821,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
253960,L495820,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Making our very own solstice fire.
253961,L495819,u7546,m510,ELLEN,What are you doing?
253962,L495817,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes."
253963,L495816,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Where are you going?
253964,L495815,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Yes, daddy."
253965,L495814,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health."
253966,L495812,u7546,m510,ELLEN,My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
253967,L495811,u7548,m510,MARTIN,My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
253968,L495810,u7546,m510,ELLEN,You?
253969,L495809,u7548,m510,MARTIN,I'll do it myself.
253970,L495808,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Do you have a better idea?
253971,L495807,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
253972,L495806,u7546,m510,ELLEN,We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
253973,L495805,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
253974,L495799,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it."
253975,L495798,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Do you know where fuse box is?
253976,L495797,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Oh, damnit!"
253977,L495796,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Hey... the fuse.
253978,L495795,u7548,m510,MARTIN,We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
253979,L495794,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Maybe the antenna's broken.
253980,L495792,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great."
253981,L495791,u7546,m510,ELLEN,I mean the armchair!
253982,L495790,u7548,m510,MARTIN,It still worked in town.
253983,L495789,u7546,m510,ELLEN,What kind of a horrible thing is that?
253984,L495781,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget..."
253985,L495780,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women."
253986,L495779,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?"
253987,L495778,u7548,m510,MARTIN,They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
253988,L495777,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?"
253989,L495776,u7548,m510,MARTIN,You'll never get away from me!
253990,L495775,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Stop that!
253991,L495762,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Oh God, Tommi..."
253992,L495761,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Ellen, move aside..."
253993,L495759,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!"
253994,L495758,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!"
253995,L495757,u7548,m510,MARTIN,I have to cut his windpipe...
253996,L495751,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"""With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."""
253997,L495750,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?"
253998,L495748,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Come on, say it.  You know..."
253999,L495747,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Why else?
254000,L496033,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
254001,L496032,u7546,m510,ELLEN,But what is the truth?
254002,L496031,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
254003,L496030,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to..."
254004,L496029,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
254005,L496016,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,"Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired."
254006,L496015,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"I really hate to bother him, but..."
254007,L496013,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Thank you.
254008,L496012,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,"Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in."
254009,L495937,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,"You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor."
254010,L495936,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Ellen.
254011,L496022,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there."

254013,L496020,u7546,m510,ELLEN,1976.  What happened back then?
254014,L496019,u7547,m510,LINDNER,"You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies."
254015,L495855,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?"
254016,L495854,u7547,m510,LINDNER,I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
254017,L495852,u7547,m510,LINDNER,Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
254018,L495851,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Do I look like it that much?
254019,L495850,u7547,m510,LINDNER,"It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?"
254020,L495849,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Ellen Straub.
254021,L495848,u7547,m510,LINDNER,"You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner."
254022,L495847,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"No, I've never seen him before."
254023,L495846,u7547,m510,LINDNER,Does this dog here belong to you?
254024,L495845,u7546,m510,ELLEN,Hello.  Can I help you?
254025,L496112,u7551,m510,PROF. ROTH,"We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down."
254026,L496111,u7546,m510,ELLEN,It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
254027,L496109,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but..."
254028,L496108,u7551,m510,PROF. ROTH,What?
254029,L496107,u7546,m510,ELLEN,I've killed my husband!
254030,L496106,u7551,m510,PROF. ROTH,Mrs. Straub!
254031,L495894,u7551,m510,PROF. ROTH,"A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception."
254032,L495893,u7546,m510,ELLEN,And that is?
254033,L495892,u7551,m510,PROF. ROTH,"There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case."
254034,L495891,u7546,m510,ELLEN,"Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!"
254035,L496159,u7547,m510,LINDNER,How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
254036,L496158,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,Hammer?
254037,L496156,u7547,m510,LINDNER,"Yes, something was..."
254038,L496155,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,"Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?"
254039,L496154,u7547,m510,LINDNER,I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
254040,L495944,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,"Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it."
254041,L495943,u7547,m510,LINDNER,We should leave the past alone.
254042,L495942,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,You didn't tell her!
254043,L495940,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
254044,L495939,u7547,m510,LINDNER,Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
254045,L495935,u7549,m510,MRS. LINDNER,Just call me Elisabeth.
254046,L495934,u7547,m510,LINDNER,"Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?"
254047,L495960,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here."
254048,L495959,u7550,m510,PAUL,"Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?"
254049,L495738,u7550,m510,PAUL,"I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?"
254050,L495737,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Twenty-three, to be exact."
254051,L495734,u7550,m510,PAUL,"I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?"
254052,L495733,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
254053,L495730,u7550,m510,PAUL,Very funny.
254054,L495729,u7548,m510,MARTIN,Tenth floor.
254055,L495728,u7550,m510,PAUL,"Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?"
254056,L495717,u7548,m510,MARTIN,"Ladies and gentlemen: The ""Straub country-residence""."
254057,L495716,u7550,m510,PAUL,"Well, look here!"
254058,L499735,u7552,m511,ALLEYN,He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
254059,L499734,u7573,m511,WILL,Ohwhat have I done?
254060,L499599,u7552,m511,ALLEYN,And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
254061,L499598,u7573,m511,WILL,You are a gentleman.
254062,L499597,u7573,m511,WILL,"Thank you, Ned."
254063,L499596,u7552,m511,ALLEYN,Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
254064,L499595,u7573,m511,WILL,Ah
254065,L499594,u7552,m511,ALLEYN,The title won't do.
254066,L499593,u7573,m511,WILL,Oh
254067,L499592,u7552,m511,ALLEYN,It's good.

254069,L499448,u7552,m511,ALLEYN,"The speech is excellent.  ""Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!"" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible."
254070,L499447,u7573,m511,WILL,You did not like the speech?
254071,L499421,u7573,m511,WILL,"Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write."
254072,L499420,u7552,m511,ALLEYN,WillWhere is Mercutio?

254076,L499486,u7553,m511,BOATMAN,Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.

254078,L499484,u7553,m511,BOATMAN,"Thank you, my lady!"
254079,L499456,u7553,m511,BOATMAN,"Writer, is he?"
254080,L499455,u7573,m511,WILL,"Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box."
254081,L499282,u7553,m511,BOATMAN,Sir Robert De Lesseps.
254082,L499281,u7573,m511,WILL,Do you know that house?

254084,L499279,u7573,m511,WILL,Really?
254085,L499278,u7553,m511,BOATMAN,"Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king."
254086,L499277,u7573,m511,WILL,Yes.
254087,L499276,u7553,m511,BOATMAN,I know your face. Are you an actor?
254088,L499275,u7553,m511,BOATMAN,"Right you are, governor!"
254089,L499274,u7573,m511,WILL,Follow that boat!
254090,L499685,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Treachery!
254091,L499684,u7558,m511,MARLOWE,You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
254092,L499683,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
254093,L499682,u7558,m511,MARLOWE,"Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline."
254094,L499681,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Never!
254095,L499680,u7558,m511,MARLOWE,Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
254096,L499679,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,"What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare."
254097,L499678,u7558,m511,MARLOWE,Twenty pounds on delivery
254098,L499677,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Wait!  Will you desist!
254099,L499676,u7558,m511,MARLOWE,Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
254100,L499675,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Tomorrow.
254101,L499674,u7558,m511,MARLOWE,You have the money?
254102,L499673,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,You have the last act?

254105,L499899,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,See you in jail.
254106,L499898,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,We will all be put in the clink.
254107,L499883,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,No Juliet?!
254108,L499882,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,We have no Juliet!
254109,L499132,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Ask him.
254110,L499131,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
254111,L499130,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,"The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us."
254112,L499129,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket."
254113,L499128,u7573,m511,WILL,Done.
254114,L499127,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
254115,L499126,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Ned is wrong for it.
254116,L499125,u7573,m511,WILL,I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
254117,L499124,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,You're a liar.
254118,L499123,u7573,m511,WILL,Ten pounds.
254119,L499122,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,How much?
254120,L499121,u7573,m511,WILL,It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
254121,L499120,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
254122,L499119,u7573,m511,WILL,Romeo

254124,L499117,u7573,m511,WILL,"Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover."
254125,L499116,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,What is the chief part?
254126,L499115,u7573,m511,WILL,"A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful."
254127,L499114,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Are you writing?
254128,L499113,u7573,m511,WILL,When I have fifty pounds.
254129,L499112,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
254130,L499111,u7573,m511,WILL,"I am still owed money for this play, Burbage."
254131,L499110,u7554,m511,BURBAGE,"There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?"
254132,L499103,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,"The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week."
254133,L499102,u7573,m511,WILL,Will it restore my gift?
254134,L499100,u7573,m511,WILL,yet cannot love nor write it.
254135,L499099,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,So now you are free to love
254136,L499098,u7573,m511,WILL,"Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing."
254137,L499097,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,"No, your marriage bed."
254138,L499096,u7573,m511,WILL,On my mother's side the Ardens
254139,L499095,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,And your relations?
254140,L499094,u7573,m511,WILL,"She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so"
254141,L499093,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,A woman of property?
254142,L499090,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,"No, no. You have a wife, children"
254143,L499089,u7573,m511,WILL,"A goodly length in times past, but lately"
254144,L499088,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,How long has it been?
254145,L499087,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,"Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?"
254146,L499086,u7573,m511,WILL,It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
254147,L499085,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,Most interesting.
254148,L499084,u7573,m511,WILL,Nothing comes.
254149,L499083,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,Interesting.
254150,L499082,u7573,m511,WILL,I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
254151,L499081,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
254152,L499080,u7573,m511,WILL,"Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift."
254153,L499079,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,"Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and"
254154,L499078,u7555,m511,DR. MOTH,And yet you tell me you lie with women?
254155,L499077,u7573,m511,WILL,"Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now"
254156,L499777,u7573,m511,WILL,And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
254157,L499776,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,That's me.
254158,L499775,u7573,m511,WILL,"I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary."
254159,L499723,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,"By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!"
254160,L499722,u7573,m511,WILL,"Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role."
254161,L499383,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,"Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe"
254162,L499382,u7573,m511,WILL,"Yes, I saw it."
254163,L499381,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,"I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful."
254164,L499358,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,Who is that?
254165,L499357,u7573,m511,WILL,Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
254166,L499780,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,"Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so."
254167,L499779,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles."
254168,L499728,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?"
254169,L499727,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
254170,L499706,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,"Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business"
254171,L499705,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business"
254172,L499356,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Yes, but very well."
254173,L499355,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,But nothing is happening.
254174,L499354,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,Very well.
254175,L499353,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,Is it going well?
254176,L499184,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Oh, it's coming, it's coming."
254177,L499183,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,Where is the play?
254178,L499177,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,I don't know. It's a mystery.
254179,L499176,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,How?
254180,L499175,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well."
254181,L499174,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,So what do we do?
254182,L499173,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre."
254183,L499172,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,by order of the Master of the Revels!
254184,L499171,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Oh, that."
254185,L499170,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,The theatres are all closed by the plague!
254186,L499169,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?"
254187,L499168,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,This time we take your boots off!
254188,L499051,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
254189,L499050,u7556,m511,FENNYMAN,Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
254190,L499048,u7557,m511,HENSLOWE,"Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something."

254342,L499162,u7560,m511,NURSE,Like Valentine and Silvia?

254350,L499154,u7569,m511,VIOLA,"But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?"

254354,L499656,u7561,m511,QUEEN,"But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true."
254355,L499654,u7561,m511,QUEEN,Above Lord Wessex?
254356,L499653,u7569,m511,VIOLA,And I love poetry above all.
254357,L499652,u7561,m511,QUEEN,And--?
254358,L499651,u7561,m511,QUEEN,"They are not acted for you, they are acted for me."
254359,L499650,u7569,m511,VIOLA,I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
254360,L499649,u7561,m511,QUEEN,Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
254361,L499648,u7569,m511,VIOLA,Your Majesty
254362,L499647,u7561,m511,QUEEN,What do you love so much?

254369,L499950,u7561,m511,QUEEN,"Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?"
254370,L499949,u7561,m511,QUEEN,"As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder."
254371,L499948,u7572,m511,WESSEX,Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?

254552,L499444,u7569,m511,VIOLA,"I will do my duty, my lord."
254553,L499443,u7572,m511,WESSEX,"She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief."
254554,L499442,u7569,m511,VIOLA,The Queen has consented?
254555,L499441,u7572,m511,WESSEX,Will you defy your father and your Queen?
254556,L499440,u7572,m511,WESSEX,"It was your eyes. No, your lips."
254557,L499439,u7569,m511,VIOLA,But why me?
254558,L499438,u7572,m511,WESSEX,"Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . ."
254559,L499437,u7569,m511,VIOLA,Virginia?!
254560,L499436,u7572,m511,WESSEX,"How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia."
254561,L499435,u7569,m511,VIOLA,"I do not love you, my lord."
254562,L499434,u7572,m511,WESSEX,Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
254563,L499433,u7569,m511,VIOLA,"Do you intend to marry, my lord?"
254564,L499432,u7572,m511,WESSEX,"No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command."
